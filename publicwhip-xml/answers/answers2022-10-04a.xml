On 30 August, I laid the foundation stone for Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal restoration which is fully-funded by Government including through the Shared Island Fund, and on track to be completed next year.</p>  <p>  On 29 September, I and the Minister for Housing, Heritage and Local Government announced 25 awards totalling more than &euro;4.3 million under the Shared Island Local Authority Development Funding Scheme, at an event in Cavan which brought together 23 different Councils from across the island. Through the Scheme they are now working in cross-border partnerships to progress feasibility work over the next year on new collaborative investment projects, with a view to accessing further funding in both jurisdictions for delivery stage, including through the Shared Island Fund. Projects address shared concerns for the island including on biodiversity, sustainable tourism, circular economy, innovation; and cultural and creative industries.</p>  <p>  The Shared Island research programme commissioned by my Department is continuing. Final reports from the Economic and Social Research Institute will be published later this month on productivity levels on the island; and, next month, on coordination of renewable energy policies and electricity infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus is on inclusive civic engagement with all communities and political traditions. The Shared Island Dialogue series has so far directly involved some 2,000 citizens and civic representatives through 11 dialogue events. On 29 June, I addressed a Dialogue with over 150 young people in attendance in Derry on the theme of Identities on a Shared Island. The next Dialogue will be on Arts and Culture at Queen&rsquo;s University in Belfast on 13 October, with participation by Minister Catherine Martin TD for the Government and Executive Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey MLA. The Dialogues are being made available online and reports are being published, to inform wider civic and political discussion.</p>  <p>  On 29 September, I participated in the launch of the first report of the All-Island Women&rsquo;s Forum; and on Monday (3 October) I launched the report of the iCommunity hub led by The Wheel and Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action. Both projects followed on from our Shared Island engagements, and supported by the Government are forging significant new civic connections and making recommendations on common concerns for communities across the island. The Government will positively consider their recommendations, as all Departments work to develop new investment, policy and cooperation projects to contribute to our Shared Island initiative.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Defence Forces representative associations are now encompassed by the Public Services Committee of ICTU for the purposes of public pay negotiations.</p><p>The current public service is &lsquo;Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo; which was due to expire at the end of 2022. As the Deputy will be aware, discussions recently concluded between the parties to the Agreement - the Public Service Committee of ICTU and certain other non-ICTU affiliated unions and associations.These discussions followed the triggering of the review clause in Building Momentum by public service unions and associations in response to the increases in the cost of living.</p><p>These were challenging discussions given the impact elevated levels of inflation but also because of the uncertainty in the global economic outlook. The Government&rsquo;s aim in these talks was to strike the right balance and seek to achieve a deal that is fair and affordable to both taxpayers generally and public service employees.</p><p>  The outcome of these discussions was a set of proposals put forward by the Workplace Relations Commission to extend Building Momentum for a period of 12 months to the end of 2023. Three additional pay adjustments totalling 6.5% are provided for under these proposals over 2022 and 2023. </p><p>These are:</p><p>An increase in annualised basic salaries for public servants of 3% backdated to 2 February 2022.</p><p>- An increase in annualised basic salaries for public servants of 2% on 1 March 2023. </p><p>- An increase in annualised basic salaries for public servants of 1.5% or &euro;750, whichever is greater, on 1 October 2023.</p><p>The cost of theses proposed pay adjustments under the extension to Building Momentum is estimated to be &euro;1.6 billion spread over three calendar years - 2022, 2023, and 2024.</p><p>This extension would make Building Momentum a three year pay deal. The extension acknowledges the higher than anticipated rates of inflation that have emerged since 2021 and in particular the impact of cost of living pressures. </p><p>  The existing Building Momentum Agreement provided headline benefits of 3%. In total, including the existing Agreement and the extension, headline benefits over the lifetime of Building Momentum amount to 9.5%, or just over 3% per year.</p><p>  In respect of public servants at lower pay levels, the extended Building Momentum provides for increases of 12.5% over its lifetime, which is an average of just over 4% per annum. </p><p>It should also be noted that Government has provided a winter cost of living package as part of Budget 2023 which contains temporary, targeted cost of living expenditure supports for individual households and businesses amounting to &euro;2.2 billion which will be implemented in 2022.</p><p>  The terms of the proposals are currently being considered by members of public service unions and representative associations. I understand that, following this process, the Public Services Committee of ICTU will meet in the coming days to consider its position on the proposals.</p><p>  It is the Government's view that an agreement on public service pay at this challenging time will play an important role in underpinning broader stability, minimising industrial unrest and supporting the continued delivery of reform and quality public services. </p></reply>

The Framework sets down the approaches and the parameters within which parties to a public works contract calculate additional costs attributable to material and fuel price fluctuations on an ongoing basis using price indices published by the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>Any increase that is determined as attributed to inflation may be shared between the parties with the State bearing up to 70% of the additional cost.  Any additional costs that are identified are to be met from within the capital ceiling allocations for each Approving Authority.</p><p>Whilst the use of the framework is voluntary, participation by the parties is strongly encouraged since it represents a pragmatic and proportionate response to the current challenges caused by inflation that are not within either party&rsquo;s control.</p><p>The measures available under the Framework strike an important balance between the additional costs incurred by the State to support contractors engaged on public projects and the State&rsquo;s ability to deliver the NDP including housing delivery, whilst providing value for money for the taxpayer.</p><p>The detailed information being sought is not collated centrally. Management and delivery of capital projects and programmes are a matter for the Sponsoring Agency and Approving Authority in each case.</p><p>The feedback that has been received by my Department would suggest that the parties are engaging  and, crucially, works are progressing in the majority of cases whilst this engagement is ongoing.</p><p>The additional cost attributed to inflation for each project will not be known until it is completed and the measures introduced are intended to operate until completion or where they are no longer required.  </p></reply>

As the first step, I asked my Department to undertake a review of the statutory framework in advance of bringing fresh proposals for reform to Government. I am happy to inform the Deputy that this process is now well advanced. </p>  <p>  I expect the Ethics Review to be completed in the coming weeks. When I have considered the review&rsquo;s findings, I will bring a report to Government, with proposals for the way forward. I intend to return to Government later in the year seeking approval of a general scheme of a Bill.</p>  <p>  In developing a renewed legislative approach, my Department has taken as its point of departure the policy framework developed for the 2015 Public Sector Standards Bill. As the Deputy may recall, this Bill was published in December 2015. It commenced Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in January 2016 and Committee Stage commenced in April 2017 - but was not finalised. The Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the Dail in January 2020, in advance of that year&rsquo;s General Election.</p>  <p>  The underlying policy approach involves consolidation of the statutory framework for ethics and giving effect to relevant recommendations of the Mahon and Moriarty Tribunals. Notably, it would see a significant strengthening of the legal obligations on public officials to disclose, as a matter of routine, actual and potential conflicts of interest, including, for the first time, provision for the confidential disclosure of liabilities over a certain threshold, in addition to sources of income and assets.</p>  <p>  In this, my ultimate goal is to build a fit-for-purpose, easy to understand and user-friendly statutory framework for Ethics that contributes to the quality and effectiveness of our public governance and by so doing enhances trust and confidence in public officials and our democratic institutions.</p></reply>

This assessment study built on previous reports of 2011 and 2015 commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Having considered all various options, the assessment study recommends a new preferred option of a technically viable drainage scheme that would prevent flooding of the railway occurring whilst also including any flood mitigation measures downstream that would be necessary either directly or indirectly with this option.  </p><p>The proposed options identified in the assessment study include:</p><p>1. Removing underground restriction between the swallow hole and spring and ancillary works</p><p>2. Attenuation of some flows at Rosroe and Finn Loughs along with removal of the restriction between the swallow hole and spring and ancillary works</p><p>3. Diverting the Rosroe Lough sub-catchment flow towards the Ratty River catchment (Clovemill Stream - tributary of Owengarney River) along with removing the underground restriction between the swallow hole and spring</p><p>4. Raising existing railway embankment in the vicinity of Ballycar Lough</p><p>5. Pumping of flood flows from the swallow hole to spring</p><p>Option 2 was identified in the Report as the preferred option.  The selection of the preferred option was based on the hydrological, hydraulic environmental impact assessments (mainly ecology, geology and hydrogeology) and costs of each option.  The primary benefits of the measures identified in the assessment are derived from the protection of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann infrastructure and accordingly it is with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to source funding for the proposed project. It is understood that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has yet to identify a funding source for the works.  The OPW will continue to work with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the other stakeholders which include Clare County Council, Geological Survey Ireland and the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service in addressing the problem on the Rail Line at Ballycar.  However, it is not a matter for the OPW to fund the measures that are proposed to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann infrastructure.  </p></reply>

These collective agreements have helped to ensure that public pay is managed in a sustainable, affordable and orderly manner. These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.</p><p>The current public service is &lsquo;Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo; which was due to expire at the end of 2022. As the Deputy will be aware, discussions recently concluded between the parties to the Agreement following the triggering of the review clause in Building Momentum by public service unions and associations due to the increases in the cost of living.</p><p>  These were challenging discussions given the impact high levels of inflation are having on living standards of workers but also because of the uncertainty in the global economic outlook. The Government&rsquo;s aim in these talks was to strike the right balance and seek to achieve a deal that is fair and affordable to both taxpayers generally and public service employees.</p><p>The outcome of these discussions was a set of proposals put forward by the Workplace Relations Commission to extend Building Momentum for a period of 12 months to the end of 2023. Three additional pay adjustments totalling 6.5% are provided for under these proposals over 2022 and 2023. These are:</p><p>- An increase in annualised basic salaries for public servants of 3% backdated to 2 February 2022.</p><p>- An increase in annualised basic salaries for public servants of 2% on 1 March 2023. </p><p>- An increase in annualised basic salaries for public servants of 1.5% or &euro;750, whichever is greater, on 1 October 2023. </p><p>The cost of theses proposed pay adjustments under the extension to Building Momentum is estimated to be &euro;1.6 billion spread over three calendar years - 2022, 2023, and 2024.</p><p>This extension would make Building Momentum a three year pay deal. The extension acknowledges the higher than anticipated rates of inflation that have emerged since 2021 and in particular the impact of cost of living pressures. </p><p>The existing Building Momentum Agreement provided headline benefits of 3%. In total, including the existing Agreement and the extension, headline benefits over the lifetime of Building Momentum amount to 9.5%, or just over 3% per year.</p><p>In respect of public servants at lower pay levels, the extended Building Momentum provides for increases of 12.5% over its lifetime, which is an average of just over 4% per annum. </p><p>It should also be noted that Government has provided a winter cost of living package as part of Budget 2023 which contains temporary, targeted cost of living expenditure supports for individual households and businesses amounting to &euro;2.2 billion which will be implemented in 2022.</p><p>These proposed pay increases are currently being balloted on by members of the relevant unions and representative associations. It is expected that the outcome of this ballot will be known by Friday, 7<sup>th</sup>October.</p><p>An agreement on public service pay would play an important role in underpinning stability, minimising industrial unrest and supporting the continued delivery of reform and quality public services over the period ahead. </p></reply>

A Steering Group, comprising of representatives from the Office of Public Works and Cork County Council, is in place to progress this Flood Relief Scheme protecting some 198 properties.  </p>  <p>  In February 2022 I visited Bantry to announce the appointment of J.B. Barry and Partners Ltd., in joint venture with JBA Consulting Ltd., by Cork County Council as engineering and environmental consultants to carry out the design of a viable scheme for the town. The scheme development and design is progressing with environmental surveys and hydrological modelling continuing in the area. Tenders for site investigations have been received and once contractors are appointed these investigations will commence.</p>  <p>  Consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the scheme. A project website is available at &lsquo;www.bantryfrs.ie&rsquo;. A number of Public Participation Days will be held throughout the delivery stages of the project, the first of which was held on 18th May 2022, with the second due to take place in Q2 2023. </p>  <p>  In tandem with progressing this scheme, Cork County Council are to progress the repair and re-construction of a culvert on Main Street, Bantry with a Section 50 application currently with the OPW for approval.  This culvert has been identified as a significant element contributing to flooding on Main Street, New Street and north and south of Wolfe Tone Square in recent months.  The OPW and Cork County Council are liaising on the integration of these works with the flood relief scheme for the town.</p>  <p>  Under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme my office approved a total of &euro;183,917 in funding to Cork County Council for interim works to mitigate flooding in Bantry. The installation of non return valves on gullies and the storm pipe non return valves have been completed. There has also been sandbags purchased for deployment in case of forecasted extreme weather events.  </p>  <p>  Separately, Cork County Council are working on developing an Individual Property Protection Scheme for Bantry. Expressions of interest for the scheme were requested, with positive responses received.

It is likely that the remains of other executed prisoners may be located with those of the Invincibles at or near their burial site.</p>  <p>  Even were it to be precisely located, there would be practical issues involved in positively identifying the individual remains.  It is understood from contemporaneous accounts that after execution, the remains were buried in quicklime and this would render an exhumation and positive identification very difficult, if not impossible. </p>  <p>  Kilmainham Gaol is a National Monument and an iconic and much respected site in the context of the national independence struggle in particular.  The fact that it is also a grave location adds a significant resonance to its penal and historical significance and there is a strong opposing view to the current campaign that believes that the grave should not be disturbed and the remains should be left within the confines of the Monument.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Office of Public Works would clearly understand that any move to undertake an exhumation and re-interral project would certainly not be undertaken unilaterally and would have to be considered and approved in the first instance as a policy matter, which is outside our remit.

This would include headquarters for central Government Departments, State security services, etc. </p>  <p>  The overall conclusion that can be drawn from the recently published Spending Review Paper is that, when the State is acquiring significant property for office accommodation, the new build or purchase options should be considered on a case by case basis in accordance with the parameters of the Public Spending Code, particularly if there is a long-term requirement, subject always to the prevailing market conditions and available funding. </p>  <p>  To meet its strategic objectives of modernising the estate and making it more efficient, OPW constantly look to appraise the potential of the existing Owned state accommodation portfolio for future redevelopment of sites, refurbishment opportunities and potential asset recycling prospects.  This is done in parallel and in conjunction with ongoing appraisal, monitoring and managing of opportunities which arise from within the Leasehold Estate.  The extensive research undertaken for the Review provides the OPW with an important evidence base on which to ground decisions on the overall development of the portfolio into the future.</p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (2021 &ndash; 2030), the OPW has been successful in securing funding for a broad range of projects, which includes a number of office developments that will further enhance the balance of leased and owned accommodation. One of the major capital projects that is being funded by the EU within Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), is the deep energy retrofit of the state owned Tom Johnson House in Dublin 4, which will reduce the buildings primary energy use by 75% and become the new headquarters of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. OPW will continue to appraise development and redevelopment opportunities on existing state owned sites with a view to seeking additional funding for investments that will meet the operational needs of client departments and agencies in modern energy efficient buildings.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, the OPW have an ongoing programme of fabric upgrades and energy efficiency retrofit projects in central government buildings to enhance the overall condition and performance of our buildings. This will ensure the enhanced performance of existing buildings and avoid the need to replace these buildings through the commercial office market.  </p>  <p>  The Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service was published in March 2022, and Departments and Agencies are currently in the process of finalising their Departmental Blended Working Policies. Inevitably, the decisions currently being formulated across each Department and Agency on patterns of attendance in the office will have a direct impact on how the physical office space will be utilised into the future. The Chairman of the OPW has recently written to all Secretary Generals across Government asking them to consider the use of their existing accommodation in the context of long term Blended Working. Departments are being asked to account for the full optimisation of existing accommodation in the context of their Blended Working policies.</p>  <p>  Lastly, the Spending review paper notes the opportunity to acquire properties at a lower rent in locations outside of the Central Business District. Each property acquisition is looked at on a case by case basis, and in the context of the business needs of each Client Department. If the Client Department has confirmed that it is feasible to locate the accommodation requirement outside of the Central Business District, OPW will examine this opportunity and assess available properties in the context of the Public Spending Code.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Spending Review paper provides an evidence base for long term decision making on the future direction of the office accommodation portfolio. Every requirement will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis in the context of the business needs of client departments, the urgency and scale attached to the accommodation request, the overarching OPW Estate Strategy, the duration of the requirement, and the availability of capital funding.</p></reply>

This is with the aim of developing a sustainable Irish agricultural sector that protects the environment and aligns with emerging consumer sentiment, while benefiting farmers and rural communities. The Programme for Government commits to the allocation of &euro;1.5bn in projected carbon tax receipts over the next ten years for this purpose.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2020 &euro;3m in carbon tax funding was allocated to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for Green Agricultural Pilots. This additional funding was allocated to enable the establishment of pilot, locally-led schemes targeting climate action on peat soils under agricultural management.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021 &euro;20m in additional funding was allocated for the creation of pilot environmental programmes. This was supplemented with the continuation of the &euro;3m in funding that was provided for agricultural programmes from carbon tax receipts in 2020, bringing the total funding for carbon tax supported measures in the agricultural sector to &euro;23m in 2021.</p>  <p>  In 2022 the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine deferred their carbon tax allocation, save the continuation of the 2020 funding of &euro;3m for green agricultural pilots. This funding was deferred on the basis that it would form part of the suite of programmes under the new Common Agricultural Policy, commencing in 2023.</p>  <p>  For 2023, &euro;81m has been allocated to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This figure represents the &euro;49m that was foregone in 2022, plus an additional allocation of &euro;29m for 2023. Again, &euro;3m in funding will be provided to continue the 2020 Green Agricultural Pilot programme.</p>  <p>  This brings the total funding that has been allocated from the carbon tax to the agricultural sector to date up to &euro;110m.</p>  <p>  The funding in 2023 will be used for the new Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme (ACRES) which will support farmers who undertake actions which are beneficial for the environment. This will include measures that support mitigating carbon emissions, protecting water quality, improving soil fertility, protecting biodiversity, adapting to climate change, and reducing chemical fertiliser usage. Beyond ACRES, the remaining &euro;3m of the 2023 Carbon Tax funds will support other initiatives, including a demonstration anaerobic digestion project</p>  <p>  The use of carbon funds in 2023 was detailed in the Budget Day publication "The Use of Carbon Tax Funds 2023" which continues to be available on the budget.gov.ie website.  </p>  <p>  Questions regarding the operational details of the schemes should be directed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine.  </p></reply>

This Circular instructs Departments to consider including green criteria in public procurement processes where clearly defined, quantifiable, verifiable, and measurable criteria have been developed, and the cost can be met within a Department&rsquo;s existing budget without impacting on service delivery. It further requires Departments to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles, and highlights the possibilities for Departments to deliver wider social and environmental aims through public procurement.</p>  <p>  Since publication of that Circular, there has been increased collaboration between my officials in the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), and a number of other Departments to encourage the implementation of social and green clauses in public procurement contracts across the State. The OGP chairs a Strategic Procurement Advisory Group to bring together the main sectoral Central Purchasing Bodies (CPBs) and key policy Departments with an interest in utilising public procurement to address national social and environmental strategies. </p>  <p>  In 2021, the OGP and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) jointly established an environmental subgroup of the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, to further facilitate discussion across CPBs and relevant Departments and Agencies on approaches to incorporate environmental considerations into procurement. In 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) updated its &lsquo;Green Public Procurement - Guidance for the Public Sector&rsquo;. This was accompanied by defined, quantifiable, verifiable, and measurable green criteria for 10 sectors. The OGP, DECC, and EPA have extensively promoted use of these criteria in public procurement. As a specific example of an action taken by the OGP to increase the use of these green criteria, this year the OGP has led on the development of &lsquo;GPP Criteria Search&rsquo; &ndash; an online search tool that allows the user rapidly to find, select, and download green public procurement (GPP) criteria relevant to specific procurement projects. This will be launched at the OGP Client Conference in November. </p>  <p>  The OGP and its partner CPBs are increasingly incorporating social and green clauses into centralised purchasing arrangements that can be utilised by contracting authorities across the State.</p></reply>

While Government has already taken significant steps to ease the burden of the rising cost of living, it is clear the winter ahead will bring uncertainty for many households and businesses. To go towards alleviating this, Budget 2023 contains a significant response to support households, public and community services and businesses.</p><p><b>Households</b></p><p>The Government announced a &euro;2.2 billion Winter cost of living package for households. This includes:</p><p>- a double week payment for weekly social welfare schemes in October,</p><p>- a fuel allowance lump sum of &euro;400,</p><p>- a once-off payment of &euro;500 to those in receipt of Carer's Support Grant and to people on Disability Allowance, Blind Pension &amp;amp; Invalidity Pension,</p><p>- a &euro;200 living alone allowance lump sum,</p><p>- a &euro;500 working family payment lump sum,</p><p>- a &euro;140 double child benefit payment,</p><p>- a once off reduction in the student contribution fee by &euro;1,000 for undergrads and 1/3 for Apprentices; &euro;1,000 increase to post-graduates tuition fee contribution grant.</p><p>- a double payment to those eligible for SUSI maintenance grants and once off payment of &euro;500 for SFI and IRC PhD researchers,</p><p>- &euro;8 million for the Student Assistance fund, and</p><p>- three &euro;200 electricity credits with the two instalments in the New Year.</p><p>In addition, a Christmas Bonus will also be paid to eligible social protection recipients in 2022 at a cost of &euro;0.3 billion. While the supports provided are substantial, Government cannot protect all households and businesses against the full effects of inflation as the level of resources available are finite, and to do so would lead to additional inflationary pressures. However, the measures introduced do recognise the particular challenges faced by those on lower and fixed incomes.</p><p>These one-off measures are complemented by a comprehensive range of new core permanent spending measures for 2023. The estimated value of those measures focusing on cost of living is c. &euro;1.3 billion. These measures include &euro;12 weekly Social Protection rates increase for working age and pension payments and an increase in the universal subsidy on the National Childcare Scheme. Health, Education and Further &amp;amp; Higher Education measures will provide further support. </p><p>A further &euro;0.15 billion will be allocated for the continuation in 2023 of the 20% average fare reduction on Public Transport and the Young Adult Card on Public Service Obligation bus and rail services. </p><p><b>Public and community services</b></p><p>In recognition of the unprecedented rise in energy bills being experienced across the economy, Government is also making available &euro;340 million in 2022 to support other sectors / services. This will support schools, further and higher education institutions, certain health funded bodies, local authorities, and a range of bodies and institutions in the areas of Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Community.</p><p><b>Business</b></p><p>In addition, to support businesses Government is introducing a &euro;200 million Ukraine Emergency Response Scheme to be administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This scheme will provide funding to help firms faced with liquidity shortages as a result of increased energy costs.</p><p>Additional taxation measures for households and businesses were also announced as part of Budget 2023.  </p></reply>

This work was supported by a Cross-Border Technical Co-ordination Group. These groups have met on numerous occasions since, most recently on 14 September this year, to coordinate on the identification of areas of potentially significant flood risk, to share information and agree approaches to the production of flood mapping in border areas and to coordinate on the identification of measures and the preparation of Flood Risk Management Plans.</p>  <p>  The Erne catchment was assessed under the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme (CFRAM), in close co-operation with DfI Rivers. The study considered increasing watercourse conveyance of the Erne system to lower water levels as a measure to reduce flood risk. This study revealed that water levels in the majority of the Erne catchment in Ireland, remain unchanged regardless of any works that could be carried out in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Flood Risk Management Plan for the Erne River Basin developed under CFRAM and published in May 2018 included a flood relief scheme for Cavan Town. Cavan County Council as the Lead Authority, in partnership with the OPW, are progressing this scheme. Byrne Looby were appointed in May 2022 as the engineering and environmental consultants to deliver the project.</p>  <p>  The Cavan Town flood relief scheme is being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, where the Government is providing an investment of &euro;1.3 billion on flood relief measures over the next decade.  When completed, the proposed flood relief scheme will protect some 110 properties - 54 residential and 56 non-residential properties.</p>  <p>  The development of flood relief schemes involves five distinct, sequential and related stages. Currently the Cavan Town flood relief scheme is at Stage 1. The detailed scheme programme schedules that this stage will be concluded in Q.1 2025.</p>  <p>  Consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme. The first stakeholder and public consultation event was recently held in Cavan on 13 September 2022.</p>  <p>  The OPW does not have Arterial Drainage Schemes on the River Erne system in County Cavan and is not responsible for channel maintenance in the area in accordance with its statutory requirements under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. However, parts of the Erne catchment are a Drainage District for which the local authority is responsible for ongoing maintenance.</p>  <p>  The OPW has no plans for further catchment-wide arterial drainage schemes. However, to target the management of flood risk outside of cities, towns and villages, in 2009 the OPW introduced the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. Funding of &euro;463,302 has been approved for Cavan County Council under this scheme since 2009.</p></reply>

I have provided &euro;85.9 billion in core expenditure. This funding will support the sustainable delivery of public services and infrastructure, and invest in the quality of life in Ireland to support a strong, fair and equal society into the future. This expenditure will ensure investment in our public sector workforce, improvements in our public services and investment in digitalisation and climate initiatives.</p>  <p>  In addition I have outlined non-core expenditure of &euro;4.5 billion which will provide for the continued support of the economy and society for the external challenges we face. Economic activity rebounded strongly as society reopened following the abatement of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, new challenges have emerged. The cost of living is increasing for many households. The war in Ukraine has meant the provision of significant humanitarian supports. Non-core allocations provide for measures in respect of a continued response to: Covid-19; Ukraine; and Brexit. This approach ensures resources can be provided on a temporary basis to respond to these challenges and then unwound when no longer required.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s aim is to deliver sustainable public expenditure, and Budget 2023 seeks to balance the need to protect the real value of public services and support citizens without adding further to inflationary pressures.</p>  <p>  Sustainable expenditure over the medium-term will be delivered through a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which provides for:</p>  <p>  - Setting the core expenditure growth rate at sustainable levels; and</p>  <p>  - Providing ongoing improvements in public services.</p>  <p>  This Framework must be responsive to the economic and fiscal context. This year has seen developments which have altered the economic landscape significantly, including higher inflation and borrowing costs. Taking account of these developments, a temporary upward adjustment is being made to the MTEF. This sees 2023 core expenditure increasing to &euro;85.9 billion, with a core expenditure growth rate of 6.3 per cent. Core expenditure growth is expected to return to 5 per cent over the medium term. </p>  <p>  Through this approach I am seeking to ensure the right balance between providing support, investing in our economy and public services, and safeguarding fiscal sustainability in the long term. </p></reply>

This includes:</p><p>- a double week of weekly social welfare schemes in October,</p><p>- a fuel allowance lump sum of &euro;400,</p><p>- a once-off payment of &euro;500 to those in receipt of Carer's Support Grant and to people on Disability Allowance, Blind Pension &amp;amp; Invalidity Pension,</p><p>- a &euro;200 living alone allowance lump sum,</p><p>- a &euro;500 working family payment lump sum,</p><p>- a double child benefit payment,</p><p>- a once off reduction in the student contribution fee by &euro;1,000 for undergrads and 1/3 for Apprentices; &euro;1,000 increase to post-graduates tuition fee contribution grant.</p><p>- a double payments to those eligible for SUSI maintenance grants and once off payment of &euro;500 for SFI and IRC PhD researchers,</p><p>- &euro;8 million for the Student Assistance fund, and</p><p>- three &euro;200 electricity credits with the two instalments in the New Year.</p><p>In addition, a Christmas Bonus will also be paid to social protection recipients in the same manner as last year. While the supports provided are substantial, Government cannot protect all households and businesses against the full effects of inflation as the level of resources available are finite, and to do so would lead to additional inflationary pressures. However, the measures introduced do recognise the particular challenges faced by those on lower and fixed incomes.</p><p>In recognition of the unprecedented rise in energy bills being experienced across the economy, Government is also making available &euro;340 million in 2022 to support other sectors / services across the economy. This will support schools, further and higher education institutions, health funded bodies, local authorities, and provide funding for areas including Cultural Institutions and Bodies, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports Bodies &amp;amp; Community Organisations. </p><p>In relation to businesses, Government is introducing a &euro;200 million Ukraine Emergency Response Scheme to be administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This scheme will provide funding to help firms faced with liquidity shortages as a result of increased energy costs. An estimated &euro;1.2 billion will be provided under the Business Energy Support Scheme. </p><p>In terms of Budget 2023, income tax measures alongside a range of permanent expenditure measures will also help households with the increasing cost of living. These measures include a &euro;1 billion Social Protection package, reductions in childcare costs through increased National Childcare subsidy and a number of health-related measures. </p><p><b>Non Core Expenditure 2023</b></p><p>A series of successive external shocks are having an impact on our society, economy and fiscal position. Our fiscal policy has remained responsive by providing supports through non-core expenditure.  Since 2020, the effects of Covid-19, Brexit and the war in Ukraine have posed considerable challenges. These have been challenging events, and our response to them has required substantial financial resources. We have been able to confront these challenges due to a strong economy and fiscal position, and a willingness to invest in sustaining and growing our economy into the future.</p><p>Allocations of temporary funding to respond to external challenges facing our economy and society are considered separately from core expenditure allocations. This approach facilitates responsive fiscal policy providing supports to deal with key emerging issues while protecting core day-to-day expenditure and investment. This ensures focus on long term goals such as enhancing investment in infrastructure and public services.</p><p>Given the expected continued impact of Covid-19, Brexit and the war in Ukraine into 2023, funding will be provided for our response to these challenges. I have provided for &euro;4.5 billion in non-core expenditure in 2023. I have allocated over &euro;1.8 billion of this funding to Departments as part of Budget 2023, while &euro;2.7 billion will remain held in reserve to allow Government to respond to these challenges as required.</p></reply>

The promoters of the scheme, with the support of then Taoiseach, requested the Office of Public Works (OPW) on behalf of the State, to undertake to provide this facility at a State-owned site. </p>  <p>  However, the economic crash resulted in the overall proposal having to be abandoned as the economic model underpinning the development had collapsed.</p>  <p>  In 2013, arbitration proceedings were instigated by the scheme&rsquo;s promoters and negotiations took place with the OPW to seek a resolution on the matter.  On 27th September 2013, on foot of legal advice, a settlement agreement was entered into whereby the OPW agreed to construct at State expense, an interactive science centre building at the north wing of the Earlsfort Terrace Complex- adjoining the National Concert Hall.</p>  <p>  The promoters of the scheme, the Irish Children's Museum Ltd (ICML), is a private company registered as a charity and was established to promote and develop the Centre.  The ICML board is currently comprised of 7 members.  The arbitration agreement entered into 2013 resulted in ICML being awarded a licence to operate the centre free of charge.  It is required to fund the cost of the exhibits in the museum estimated at &euro;15-&euro;20m. </p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputy following the Arbitrators decision in June 2022 that the Office of Public Works must proceed to build the facility and provide it to Irish Children's Museum Limited (ICML) for purposes of operating the museum.  The Office of Public Works are completing the next steps in this process. </p>  <p>  The first step in the process was to lodge a new planning application to replace a previously lapsed planning application to Dublin City Council which happened on the 29th September 2022 to build a National Children&rsquo;s Science Museum on Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2</p>  <p>  Subsequently the second step was to commence a prequalification competition for the main contractor and reserved specialists for the building of a new museum and is available on the etenders portal since Friday 30th September 2022.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works must also meet the capital costs of constructing a new National Children&rsquo;s Science Museum at the North Wing of the National Concert Hall as per the terms of our agreement with the NCSC Ltd.   The most recent cost estimate is &euro;47m but this will have risen since due to higher construction inflation than calculated at the time.  The cost will be incurred primarily in 2024 and 2025.</p>  <p>  My Office will liaise with other government departments especially the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sports and The Gaeltacht, Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other relevant public bodies.</p></reply>

The lease commenced on the  21<sup>st</sup>December 2016 and the current annual rent is &euro;8.8m.</p><p>Miesian Plaza provides accommodation for over 900 civil servants from four Government Departments, including head quarter accommodation for the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The building also provides additional accommodation for the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>Miesian Plaza is one of the flagship buildings in the State&rsquo;s office portfolio and represents best in class in terms of modern office accommodation.  Most importantly for me, is the fact that this building has the highest credentials in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability.</p><p>Following completion of the lease an issue arose in relation to the measurement standard applied as the basis of calculation of the annual rent.  When the issue was identified the OPW engaged with the Landlord to mitigate the effect of this issue in a manner that would be acceptable to both parties.</p><p>As a result of lengthy, complex and intensive engagement, at a very senior level, between the OPW and the Landlord, the parties have agreed to extend the lease on Miesian Plaza by a period of 9 months at a nominal rent of &euro;10 per annum.  A Deed of Variation has now been finalised to give effect to this agreement.  </p><p>The OPW considers that this agreement is the best possible outcome achievable for the taxpayer in all the circumstances. While this issue of measurement was unfortunate and should never have arisen, I would acknowledge the efforts of my own officials and the representatives of the landlord in bringing the issue to a conclusion.  The engagement between the OPW and the Landlord on this matter was at all times constructive and professional.</p><p>Out of courtesy, given their ongoing interest in the matter, the OPW have informed the Public Accounts Committee of the outcome of their engagement with the Landlord on this issue.</p></reply>

The tanks are approximately 20 years old, constructed in steel (single skin) and are in poor condition. The existing tanks are vulnerable to corrosion, which potentially could result in an oil leak causing serious contamination of the local environment. The replacement programme targets old tanks, such as those in Glendalough and replaces them with modern double-skin bunded tanks. These modern oil tanks give added safeguards and enhanced protection to prevent corrosion. </p>  <p>  The oil tank replacement does not involve any upgrade or changes to the existing heating system and therefore the use of non-fossil fuel heating does not arise. The Deputy should be assured that the use of non-fossil fuel heating will of course be considered as part of any future planned energy retrofit or refurbishment of the visitor centre. Currently there are no such plans.</p>  <p>  Glendalough is a signature destination within Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East.  It is renowned for its dramatic landscape valley, set in a glaciated valley with two lakes, the monastic remains include a superb round tower, stone churches and decorated crosses.  At the mouth of the Glendalough Valley is the 'Monastic City' a National monument in State Ownership under management of OPW.</p>  <p>  The title of 'Monastic City' given to the remains of the famous early Christian monastic settlement first established by St. Kevin in the 6th century in the Glendalough Valley. The monks abandoned the settlement centuries ago due to religious and political upheavals, but many of their hand-built stone buildings still stand, a testament to their way of life.  The site is interpreted by OPW Guide staff who welcome approximately 71,000 visitors to the Centre.  However, the Monastic City, which is accessible without recourse to the Visitor Centre, attracts in the region of 700,000 - 750,000 visitors per annum and approx. 1.5 million visitors to the National Park making them amongst the most popular locations in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In light of the incredible visitor demand in this location, in 2020, the Office of Public Works in partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, National Parks and Wildlife Service, the National Monuments Service and Wicklow County Council commissioned a Visitor Experience and Management Masterplan for Glendalough and Wicklow Mountains National Park and Visitor Orientation Recommendations for Co. Wicklow.  The development of this masterplan is currently on-going.</p>  <p>  Until such time as the Masterplan process is concluded, OPW has no plans to install new infrastructure at Glendalough.  However, any new developments would not proceed without the necessary environmental assessments being undertaken and the necessary planning permissions sought and granted.</p></reply>

Work is also ongoing to establish and convene a Programme Monitoring Committee for PEACEPLUS in order to approve programme rules, as well as the first draft funding calls for the new programme.</p>  <p>  These steps will ensure that PEACEPLUS can open for funding applications at the earliest possible stage over the months ahead, following completion of a Financing Agreement for the programme.</p></reply>

In this regard the OPW actively manages both an owned and leased office accommodation portfolio in support of Government requirements and policy. </p>  <p>  The OPW has a significant and diverse office accommodation portfolio distributed throughout the country, comprising of 890,488 square meters at year end 2021, and including a range of differing types of office provision, from prestige heritage buildings to brand new grade A office accommodation.  </p>  <p>  To meet its strategic objectives of modernising the estate and making it more efficient, OPW constantly seeks to appraise the potential of the existing Owned state accommodation portfolio in terms of refurbishment opportunities, potential asset recycling prospects and future redevelopment sites.  This is done in parallel and in conjunction with ongoing appraisal, monitoring and managing of opportunities which arise from within the Leasehold Estate. </p>  <p>  Managing an office accommodation portfolio of this size and diversity present significant challenges, particularly in terms of modernisation.  For instance, due to OPW&rsquo;s heritage remit there will always be a proportion of OPW&rsquo;s office portfolio in heritage buildings. Such heritage buildings, by their nature, present very complex challenges. The OPW&rsquo;s existing office accommodation portfolio has a disproportionate amount of buildings dating from the early 1950&rsquo;s to the early 1990&rsquo;s. In many cases, these buildings are now raising significant issues for Client Departments, and are in need of major reinvestment.</p>  <p>  In order to address the ageing profile of the office accommodation, significant projects are currently underway to improve the condition and quality of the portfolio These projects have been supported by capital funding under the National Development Plan, and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.  This funding will go some way to modernising the office accommodation portfolio into the future.</p>  <p>  Major modernisation projects currently underway across the state owned office accommodation portfolio include new office developments on Leeson Lane and Military Rd, Dublin and a deep retrofit project in Tom Johnson House, Dublin.</p>  <p>  Separately, there are a number of office accommodation fit-out projects, in newly constructed office developments which are at various stages of their project lifecycle across the leasehold portfolio.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the OPW has an ongoing programme of fabric upgrades and energy efficiency retrofit projects in government buildings to enhance the overall condition and performance of our buildings. Central to these upgrade projects is the need to ensure that all buildings over time are increasingly sustainable and aligned with best practice relating to the climate change agenda.  </p>  <p>  Lastly, the OPW is currently collaborating with SEAI to deliver a &ldquo;Building Retrofit Pathfinder Programme&rdquo; with overall funding of &euro;30M. </p></reply>

The responsibility for the management and delivery of investment projects, within the agreed allocations and within the national frameworks such as the Public Spending Code, rests with the individual sponsoring Department in each case.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-30, published last year, demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure and investment needs over the medium term horizon. The NDP 2021-2030 provides &euro;165 billion in public capital funding alongside a detailed and positive vision for Ireland up to 2030 as part of Project Ireland 2040. In Budget 2023 last week, I announced an additional &euro;800 million which will be made available under the NDP for core capital spending to help in delivering the largest, greenest and most ambitious infrastructure plan in the history of the State. In overall terms, over &euro;12 billion will be available next year for vital infrastructure investment. Capital investment next year will be 4 1/2% of national income (GNI*) well above the EU average in recent years of 3% (GDP). This represents a very substantial commitment of resources.</p>  <p>  This investment will be delivered in line with the National Planning Framework with increases in nearly every sector, but with a particular focus on housing, climate action, transport and health. Capital allocations are set out in the NDP on a Departmental basis for the period to 2025 and on an aggregate basis out to 2030. The capital expenditure ceilings detailed in the NDP are cognisant of the overall capability of the construction sector to deliver on the NDP and of the appropriate share of National Income being devoted to infrastructure. In addition, extensive analysis was conducted in the NDP in relation to sectoral demands, the macroeconomic context and a highly engaged public consultation process. The levels of capital spending, at close to 5% of GNI*, are already among the highest in the EU and are close to the limit of the overall capability to deliver in the coming decade. In these circumstances, the work detailed as part of the NDP provides assurance that the total quantum of the NDP allocation and the sectoral shares within that continue to be appropriate as part of Budget 2023.  </p></reply>

It is often referred to as Dublin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Green Lung&rsquo; as it offers citizens and visitors an extraordinary opportunity to engage with nature and the outdoors right in the heart of our capital city.</p>  <p>  Following an extensive public consultation process, the Phoenix Park Transport and Mobility Options Study Post-Consultation Report was published last year with a number of key recommendations, including the reduction of the speed limit from 50 kilometres per hour to 30 kilometres per hour.</p>  <p>  The lower speed limit was introduced for public safety and there has been a reduction of speeds within the Park with a noticeable change in driver behaviour, making the Park a safer place for all visitors.</p>  <p>  Studies have shown that a reduction in the speed limit to 30 kilometres per hour reduces the risk of fatalities. The 30 kilometres per hour speed limit has been adopted in many other urban areas across Europe including cities in, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden, not only for safety reasons, but to reduce noise, air pollution and CO2 emissions.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to support the OPW in all the changes and improvements being undertaken in the Park. While a change in driver behaviour within the Park has been observed with most motorists respecting the lower speed. </p>  <p>  In addition, work continues on another of the key recommendations contained in the study published last year; the development of a Parking Strategy for the Phoenix Park. The Parking Strategy will address both vehicular and cycle parking within the boundary of the Phoenix Park, as well as any potential impacts on the immediate surrounding areas. The Strategy will also address the needs of those with mobility issues and their parking requirements. The draft Strategy will be put for public consultation this autumn with a view to finalising it by the end of 2023. </p>  <p>  The OPW is committed to improving the experience of all visitors to the Phoenix Park by making it safer for all visitors. </p></reply>

All local authorities may carry out flood mitigation works, within their own capital works programme and using their own resources, or by applying for funding under the Office of Public Works Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding within their areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects. Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the Scheme, including a cost benefit ratio.</p><p>Since 2017 some &euro;1.1m of allocation has been approved to Monaghan County Council under this scheme and the associated breakdown from 2017 to 2022 is set out beneath. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>&euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>&euro;58,500 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>&euro;459,900 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;500,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>&euro;76,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>&euro;0 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The OPW guidelines for funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, together with a full list of funding approvals since 2009 is available on the OPW website: www.floodinfo.ie</p></reply>

The EU&rsquo;s Temporary Protection Directive provides the legal framework for assisting Ukrainians entering the EU who are officially called Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTPs). The Government&rsquo;s overall humanitarian response is coordinated with our EU partners and other countries. Because of the sudden and unprecedented numbers of new arrivals in the State, over such a short period of time, the Government, of necessity, has had to use a range of accommodation sources to facilitate displaced Ukrainians.  These include hotels, guesthouses, former religious buildings, sports halls, youth hostels, scout dens, arenas, holiday villages and tented camps as well as space in privately owned homes pledged through the Irish Red Cross.</p><p>On 11<sup>th</sup>April, the Government agreed that the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) would lead on addressing the medium and long-term need to develop capacity for Ukrainian arrivals including the possible provision of modular accommodation. A Task-force was set up, led by the DHLGH, to oversee a 3-streamed approach to modular, refurbishments and new builds. </p><p>Arising from a Memorandum from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, considered on 26<sup>th</sup>April, the Government decided on a range of measures to boost the supply of accommodation for refugees arriving from Ukraine. These measures included a rapid build, volumetric modular units, option the evaluation of which was to be led by the Office of Public Works (OPW).<i></i></p><p>The OPW in conjunction with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) representing specialist modular manufacturers and main contractors, developed an exemplar design and specification to ensure Building Regulation compliance. The design is based exclusively on rigid frame volumetric structures which represents the best method, having regard to the need for quality, speed, and simplicity of design and production, to achieve the scale of programme required. </p><p>The modular prototype that has been designed is a highly energy efficient (BER A2) durable single storey unit (with a useful life of 60 years). The 60 year lifespan was chosen to be consistent with housing standards and to maximise the long-term value to the exchequer, of the significant upfront investment involved, by providing units that can meet future accommodation needs, once the humanitarian crisis, induced by the War in Ukraine, has passed. </p><p>On 28<sup>th</sup>June, 2022, the Government authorised the roll-out of a modular homes programme to provide accommodation for 2,000 Ukrainians, predominantly women and children, in 500 family units at several sites across Ireland. Since then, my Office has been working collaboratively with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as the Lead Department, and a range of other bodies such as the Department of Housing, Local Government, and Heritage, local authorities, Irish Water, ESB networks and Open Eir to deliver the modular housing programme. Sisk and Son is the main contractor that has been engaged to manage the site enabling works and to arrange for the procurement, transportation and installation of the modular units. Site evaluation works are being undertaken by my Office in collaboration with Sisk to finalise the list of sites necessary for the programme. My Office is also supporting the Department of Children, Equality, Disability and Youth with their comprehensive programme of engagement with representatives of local communities adjacent to sites under consideration for the installation of modular units. Enabling works are scheduled to start shortly on a number of sites that have been prioritised for early development with a view to completing the overall programme for the installation and occupation of the 500 units on a phased basis up to end February 2023.</p><p>The successful delivery of these units will meet the Governments objective to provide new sources of accommodation, as part of the State&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Ukrainian crisis, and will also provide the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth  with a flexibility of response to accommodation demand that is not currently available.</p></reply>

The scheme is aimed at businesses whose average unit gas or electricity price has risen by over 50% compared with their average unit gas or electricity price for the same period in 2021.</p>  <p>  Pending State Aid approval, it is intended that the scheme will be up and running before the end of the year. Payments will be backdated to include September 2022. Whilst the finer details of the scheme are being finalised, in general, qualifying businesses will be able to apply to Revenue for a cash payment, representing an advance credit for energy expenses that are deductible for income and/or corporation tax purposes. The credit will be calculated as 40% of the excess of the 2022 bill over the 2021 bill, capped at &euro;10,000 per business unit per month.  Overall caps at business level will also apply as set out in the EU Temporary Crisis Framework. </p>  <p>  The first thing any business can do to mitigate high energy bills is to take all steps possible to reduce energy use. A good first step to achieving greater energy efficiency is for businesses to gain a better understanding of their current usage. My Department's Climate Toolkit 4 Business provides a clear and accessible starting point for any business, pointing them to enterprise-specific climate action resources, including energy efficiency measures. Businesses can save their results and then monitor their performance over time. </p>  <p>  An Energy Audit voucher is available to many businesses from the SEAI. The Support Scheme for Energy Audits pays for a high-quality energy audit for SMEs that spend more than &euro;10,000 annually on energy. There is also a range of energy efficiency modules on offer through the SEAI Energy Academy &ndash; a free, online e-learning platform designed and curated by Ireland's leading energy experts. </p></reply>

The EU Working Time Directive is primarily a health and safety directive and its purpose is to lay down common minimum safety and health requirements for organising the working time of employees in all EU Member States.  </p><p>  Article 6 of the EU Directive on Working Time provides for limits to working time of not more than 48 hours a week on average (including any overtime).  The EU Directive provides that, when calculating limits to weekly working time, the hours worked may be averaged over a &ldquo;reference period&rdquo;.  This allows longer hours to be worked in certain weeks, provided that correspondingly shorter hours are worked in other weeks.</p><p>Section 15 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 transposes this EU Directive regarding working time.  For most employees the reference period is four months. For night workers it is two months.  For employees whose work is subject to seasonality (e.g. tourism or agriculture), or where employees are directly involved in ensuring continuity of essential services (e.g. hospitals, airports) or production (e.g. electricity), the reference period is six months.  The 48-hour average week may be averaged over a period of up to 12 months for employees who have entered into a collective agreement with their employer if that collective agreement is approved by the Labour Court.  Section 33 of the 1997 Act provides that an employer can employ an employee who has also worked for another employer but only where the aggregate of the periods for which such an employee does work for each of such employers respectively in that relevant period does not exceed the 48 hour total. Whenever the limit is breached the employer and employee shall each be guilty of an offence.</p><p>  The 1997 Act also provides for an uninterrupted minimum daily rest period of 11 hours, and at least 35 hours of uninterrupted weekly rest. These rest requirements along with the 48 hour (maximum) working week act as a safeguard to ensure that employees do not work excessive hours.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department as well as the Ministers of State and I, have had ongoing engagement with the business community and its wider stakeholders in relation to the impact of rising energy costs on businesses. Fora where the cost of doing business and energy costs have been discussed with the business community include: </p>  <p>  - the Labour Employer Economic Forum on the 7th of September which I attended along with the Taoiseach;</p>  <p>  - the SME and State Bodies Group on the 13th of July which I chaired with the Minister for Finance;</p>  <p>  - the Enterprise Forum which I chaired on the 29th of June;</p>  <p>  -  the Retail Forum chaired by Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Damien English on the 8th of June; and</p>  <p>  - the Hospitality and Tourism Forum chaired by myself and Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin TD on the 12th of September.</p>  <p>  My Department has taken a leading role in the Government response to rising energy costs, working closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, who coordinate the whole of Government response via the Energy Supply Emergency Group on which my Department is represented. In particular, my Department convenes the Business Energy Users Sub-group which was set up to assess the impacts of rising energy costs on businesses and to help inform the Government response. This includes business representative groups, as well as officials from my Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, Enterprise Ireland, and IDA Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the scale of the energy crisis, and the impact it is having on business energy costs. With this in mind, a significant package to help businesses with escalating energy costs and to plan for the future was announced in Budget 2023. </p>  <p>  This package includes the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme, which will provide qualifying businesses with up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas bills - when compared to last year - up to a maximum of &euro;10,000 per month. This is intended to aid small businesses most and will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners. The scheme will be backdated to September and will run until at least February 2023. Through supporting businesses in meeting rising energy prices, this scheme will help protect the jobs of those working in impacted sectors. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a new Growth &amp;amp; Sustainability Loan Scheme, which will make up to &euro;500 million in low-cost investment loans of up to 10 years available to SMEs, with no collateral required for loans up to &euro;500,000. A minimum of 30% of the lending volume will be targeted towards Environmental Sustainability purposes.  </p>  <p>  The reduced rate of VAT on gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% has been extended until the 28th February 2023. We are also raising awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses reduce the amount of energy they use in the first place and improving take-up of the approximately 20 existing schemes that we already have in place for business to help them reduce their energy costs. These include the Green4Micro programme and the Climate Toolkit for Business. </p>  <p>  Additionally, small businesses can currently receive an energy audit voucher from SEAI to get professional advice on how to increase efficiency and reduce their costs. Other financial assistance includes the SEAI Community Grant and grants for microgeneration. </p>  <p>  I would also encourage any businesses seeking assistance to contact their Local Enterprise Office. The Local Enterprise Offices act as a &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance, and act as a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for all government supports available to business owners throughout the country. Further information on the available business energy assistance can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website: Energy supports - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie)</p>  <p>  The Government will keep the energy situation under constant review, and we will continue to examine what measures are possible to manage the impact of rising energy prices. </p></reply>

The system is managed through the use of lists designating highly skilled and ineligible occupations.</p>  <p>  On 14 June 2021, following a review of the employment permit occupation lists, changes to the employment permit system were announced, to address skills and labour shortages in the healthcare and nursing home sector.  Following this review, the occupation of Nursing Auxiliary or Assistant (Health Care Assistant) in hospital/nursing home settings became eligible for a General Employment Permit from that date. As the occupation of Health Care Assistant is not on the Critical Skills Occupations List it is not eligible for a Critical Skills Employment Permit unless the remuneration on offer is &euro;64,000 per annum or more.</p>  <p>  As regards processing times, following the implementation of an internal plan of action which increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications, the Employment Permits Unit has reduced the number of applications awaiting processing from about 11,000 in January 2022 to about 2,443 today, despite further strong demand in 2022.  </p>  <p>  Processing times are now 2-4 weeks depending on the permit type.

Fishing vessel owners who do not affect compliance on a voluntary basis, following the issue of a Contravention Notice, will, depending on the legislation involved, be issued with a Compliance Notice or Fixed Payment Notice or face prosecution. Current policy provides for the initiation of prosecution proceedings in relation to the offence of employing a non-EEA national without a valid permission to work.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, the WRC consulted with 16 relevant stakeholders who were requested to make written submissions in relation to, among other matters, possible additional outreach measures for fishing vessel owners and migrant fishers. The WRC&rsquo;s February 2022 report on the outcomes of these consultations sets out a range of actions including some 23 measures and initiatives, currently being progressed. </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them. Once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.</p>  <p>  As you will also be aware, workers can request a determination from the Scope Section of the Department of Social Protection specifically in relation to their employment status where they believe their work history has been misclassified. Applications are thoroughly examined by a Social Welfare Inspector before a determination is made by a Deciding Officer in accordance with the law.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the WRC published a report following its audit of the Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector.

Gas and electricity retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Operating within the overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the independent regulator, CRU, which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999.</p>  <p>  In cases where apartment blocks or groups of buildings are supplied with heat, rather than fuel, commercial rates apply, as the energy service operator is purchasing the fuel at a large scale for this purpose. In this regard, under the Multi-Unit Developments Act, 2011, Owners&rsquo; Management Companies are precluded from entering contracts of duration greater than three years, and this provides a possibility to renegotiate energy supplier contracts.</p>  <p>  District heating, within a structured framework, is a technology that, inter alia, offers the potential to diversify fuel supply used to heat the building sector; can offer flexibility in fuel choice; and the ability to adapt to changes in the economic and policy landscape. The Climate Action Plan 2021 contains actions to provide a solid basis for the appropriate expansion of district heating in Ireland, including the establishment of a multi-disciplinary District Heating Steering Group, which was established earlier this year. The Steering Group has met eight times to date and oversees a number of Working Groups that are conducting in-depth solutions based analysis of the key areas that must be addressed in order to support district heating. The Steering Group is working on recommendations to ensure that a robust governance and regulatory framework is put in place to support the expansion of district heating. This will help ensure consumer protection, and considerations in this regard encompass legacy group heating schemes that are already in operation.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will soon initiate a pilot feasibility study to explore the technical viability and implications of moving existing group heating schemes to renewable energy sources. This will inform the work of the Steering Group, which is due to bring its report to Government later this year.</p></reply>

The schemes offer grants for individuals who can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy upgrades for people at risk of energy poverty. Improving these homes has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.   Near Zero Energy Building requirements for new dwellings were introduced into the Building Regulations in April 2019 by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Many of the techniques required to achieve NZEB, such as improved fabric and renewables, have been introduced on a gradual basis into Part L of the Building Regulations since 2007. These incremental improvements have effectively eased the transition and minimised the additional effort and costs required to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.</p>  <p>  The NZEB requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from fossil fuels for heating.  </p>  <p>  A modelling and cost study was carried out by an external cost economic consultant for the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for NZEB. The average uplift in cost across all dwelling types modelled was 1.9%.</p>  <p>  Grant funding to improve energy performance are available for existing homes because these homes were not required to meet the most up to date NZEB Building Regulations. It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer. Grants are not targeted at meeting compliance requirements when building a new home.  </p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 146,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme.</p>  <p>  In line with the Scheme guidelines and technical guidance, the Warmer Homes Scheme does not support insulation works on homes older than 1940, traditional or older buildings, specifically stone, random rubble and single-leaf brick walls. Older stone-build buildings (generally those built up until around the 1940s) usually fall into the category of traditionally built buildings.  </p>  <p>  To support the proper upgrade of traditional buildings a new technical Guidance Document - &ldquo;Energy Efficiency in Traditional Buildings&rdquo; is being developed led by the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage. My Department and the SEAI are participating in the steering group overseeing the project.  The objective is to finalise the guidance having regard to submissions received in the pubic consultation with a view to publishing it this year.  Once available this guidance will be an important resource to support contractors in the appropriate energy efficiency upgrade and renovation of older stone-build buildings while ensuring compliance with the appropriate building regulations. </p>  <p>  The Warmer Homes Scheme criteria relating to the inclusion of insulation works on homes built before 1940 will be kept under review in the context of the new Guidance Document.</p></reply>

This includes a new Electricity Cost Emergency Benefit Scheme through whereby &euro;550.47 (exclusive of VAT) will be credited to each domestic electricity account in three payments of &euro;183.49 in each of the following billing periods - November/December 2022, January/February 2023 and March/April 2023 to an estimated 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts, including pay as you go accounts. The estimated cost of this scheme is &euro;1.211 billion.</p>  <p>  Under the previous Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment, a credit of &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT), was applied to all domestic electricity accounts through April, May and June 2022. It used the single eligibility criterion of an MPRN to ensure payments to each domestic electricity account as early as possible without any additional means testing. The payment was applied to domestic electricity accounts i.e. those which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2).Upon the scheme&rsquo;s conclusion on 30 June 2022, over 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts had received the payment, with the value of these payments totalling almost &euro;377 million. This means 99.36% of all eligible domestic electricity accounts had the credit applied. The need to use the meter point registration number (MPRN) as the unique identifier, while ensuring a very broad reach and no application or means testing, does result in a relatively small number of households not being able to access the payment.</p>  <p>  While the vast majority of people who rent their homes have their own MPRNs, there may be some who could have arrangements whereby their landlord holds the MPRN and energy costs are paid to the landlord in a variety of ways. There is no data set identifying this cohort. However, my Department has worked with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Residential Tenancies Board to make people aware of the RTB mediation services available to tenants in the event landlords did not pass on the payment to tenants in these situations. The RTB has reported that contacts with them on this matter were extremely low with regard to the first Scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department also continues to engage with the Department of Social Protection on how to support people struggling to pay with their energy costs in the context of existing supports for meeting household bills. I note the comprehensive set of measures introduced as part of the Budget 2023 cost of living package aimed at supporting those most in need, including the expansion in eligibility for the Fuel Allowance and an additional lump sum payment of &euro;400 for households in receipt of the Allowance, bringing its total amount for this winter to a total of &euro;1,334.</p></reply>

As part of this, the CRU decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis which must be reflective of the market, or wholesale, value of the electricity, in line with the requirements of Article 21(2)(d) of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. We are aware that suppliers have published a range of CEG tariffs from &euro;13.5c/kWh up to &euro;20c/kWh which allows customers to shop around and switch suppliers to obtain the best rates for selling and purchasing electricity. </p><p>  It is important to note that a key aspect of the eligibility criteria for the CEG is that microgenerators must meet the definition for &lsquo;renewables self-consumers', as per the recast Renewable Energy Directive, This places a focus on generating electricity for one's own consumption, and thereafter with an entitlement to receive remuneration for excess electricity fed into the grid. </p><p>  This remuneration is different to the retail electricity market and the prices a domestic electricity consumer is charged by their supplier. Retail prices take account of the cost to purchase electricity on the wholesale market, while covering the operational costs of the company and their operating margin; and also remaining competitive in the marketplace. This also includes the network charges required for use of the electricity grid. As such, retail electricity prices and CEG remuneration tariffs cannot be compared on a like for like basis. </p><p>Maximising the consumption of self-generated renewable electricity will provide the most benefit to microgenerators to offset rising electricity costs, as well as shorten the payback period for their investment. This can be achieved by actively matching home energy use against the peak generating times of the Solar PV system, whenever possible. </p></reply>

Grants will also be administered by SEAI and are up to a maximum of &euro;2,400.</p><p>Moreover, with the recent introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG), any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises of these microgenerators is now eligible for an export payment; which further supports the investment.</p><p>Since 2018, the SEAI has supported the installation of domestic Solar PV systems for over 12,000 homes, and with demand for the domestic Solar PV grant increasing significantly throughout the year, we expect that grant applications will exceed 12,000 in 2022 alone. I also understand that approximately 40,000 micro- and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and over 26,550 of this cohort have smart meters which means they are already accruing the value of the CEG tariff for their exported electricity.</p><p>The final phase of the MSS will involve the introduction of a Clean Export Premium (CEP) feed-in tariff, to support non-domestic applicants for installation sizes greater than 6kWp up to 50kWp. This will consist of a guaranteed export tariff support for new installations, that is fixed for 15 years; and it is expected the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will consult on an implementation plan for the CEP tariff by end of 2022.</p><p>While the level of interest in the MSS indicates that the scheme is working well, its operation and effectiveness will, like all such schemes, be kept under review and adjustments made where necessary.</p></reply>

My Department is working across the energy supply system, and with NGOs, to ensure that households and businesses are protected this winter.</p><p>The measures include:</p><p>- the initial and now the an enhanced electricity credit of three &euro;200 payments (inclusive of VAT) to Domestic Electricity Accounts to be paid in the November/December, January/February, and March/April billing cycles</p><p>- an extension of the 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas until February 2023</p><p>- a &euro;400 lump sum payment to Fuel Allowance recipients</p><p>- &euro;200 lump sum payment for pensioners and people with a disability getting the Living Alone Increase</p><p>- &euro;500 cost of living lump sum payment to all families getting Working Family Payment</p><p>- double payment of Child Benefit to support all families with children</p><p>- &euro;500 cost of living payment for people receiving Carer's Support Grant will be paid in November</p><p>- &euro;500 lump sum cost of living disability support grant will be paid to all people receiving a long term disability payment</p><p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999.</p><p>As part of its statutory role, the CRU also has consumer protection functions and sets out a number of rules for suppliers to follow in the Electricity and Gas Suppliers Handbooks. These include special provisions for vulnerable customers around areas such as billing and disconnections.</p><p>  Following engagement with customer representative groups, energy suppliers and network operators, the CRU announced enhanced consumer protection measures. These include:</p><p>- An extension to moratoriums on disconnections from 1 month to 3 months (1 December to 28 February)</p><p>- Extended debt repayment periods</p><p>- Reduced debt burden on pay-as-you-go top-ups</p><p>- Better value for those on financial hardship meters</p><p>- Promotion of a Vulnerable Customer Register</p><p>  A vulnerable customer is defined as a household customer who is critically dependent on electrically powered equipment, which includes, but is not limited to, life protecting devices, assistive technologies to support independent living and medical equipment. This category of vulnerable customers cannot be disconnected for non-payment at any time. Vulnerable customers are also defined as those who are particularly vulnerable to disconnection during the winter months for reasons of advanced age or physical, sensory, intellectual or mental health. The moratorium on disconnections for this group has been extended to 6 months (1 October to 31 March). It is important that people who are in such a situation contact their energy supplier to register with them as a vulnerable customer. Their electricity supplier will then notify ESB Networks. ESBN maintains a Vulnerable Customer Register based on the information provided to them by suppliers.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on energy regulatory matters, such as the matter raised in this question, to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply</p></reply>

They are also leading to windfall gains for some energy companies across Europe, particularly those companies involved in the production of fossil fuels and those who are producing energy at a much lower cost than the cost of gas.ESB&rsquo;s generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately, so increased profits from ESB&rsquo;s generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland. Group profits are invested in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as used to pay tax and dividends to the Government.</p><p>Formal dividend policies are in place for all the Commercial Semi State Bodies (CSSBs) operating in the energy sector. These have been developed via the Shareholder Expectations Framework and, in each case, seek to strike an appropriate balance between the payment of dividends and re-investment in the business. Where the dividend target is based on adjusted profits after tax, higher profits arising in any given year in the ordinary course would fall within the scope of the normal targeted dividend payments. </p><p>ESB is experiencing greater than forecast profits and would be expected to return significantly higher Dividends in accordance with existing dividend policies. As a shareholding Minister, I have no specific power to direct ESB to pay a dividend.  It would be a matter for the Board to determine at their discretion in any year whether a dividend should be declared when, in their opinion, the profits of the company justify such payment. Projected profits and dividends are a confidential matter for the company.</p><p>ESB recently published their interim accounts confirming the payment of an interim dividend of &euro;122m to the Exchequer. The dividend will be used to help ease the energy bill crisis. Profits and dividends paid over the last five years for ESB are set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <td>Figures expressed in EUR'm</td>       <td>2022</td>       <td>2021</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2017</td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>ESB (financial year ended December)</th>       <th>Jun-22*</th>       <th>Dec-21</th>       <th>Dec-20</th>       <th>Dec-19</th>       <th>Dec-18</th>       <th>Dec-17</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of months in period</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Profit after Tax (Reported)</td>       <td>390</td>       <td>191</td>       <td>126</td>       <td>338</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>-32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Profit after Tax (Adjusted)**</td>       <td>203</td>       <td>377</td>       <td>401</td>       <td>432</td>       <td>207</td>       <td>213</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dividends Paid (Total)</td>       <td>126</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>116</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dividends Paid (Exchequer)</td>       <td>122</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>41</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>110</td>    </tr> </table> *<i>ESB published Interim results for the six months to June 2022.</i></p><p><i>*Profit after Tax (adjusted) comprises reported net profit after tax adjusted for exceptional items and certain fair value movements. Additional adjustments may be applied by the individual entities in arriving at adjusted profit after tax for dividend purposes</i>.</p><p>At the Council of Energy Ministers meeting on 9 September, which I attended, the issue of windfall gains was discussed in some detail.  On 14 September the European Commission published a proposed regulation which includes measures aimed at addressing windfall gains in the electricity sector and in fossil fuel production. </p><p>The principle that I am leading on is that windfall gain on the back of the war in Ukraine and the impact on prices, needs to be captured and redistributed to customers. The mechanism by which this is done, be it by windfall taxes, dividends, or EU regulations is being finalised with a view to identifying the optimum solution. </p><p>On Friday I attended a meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers to finalise and approve the proposal, which is expected to raise additional revenues to be used to reduce the cost of energy for households and businesses. <font color="#0A0A0A"> Decisions were taken on three matters in an agreed package including: (i) a windfall tax or levy on the surplus profits made by fossil fuel companies</font>with activities in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal and refinery sector<font color="#0A0A0A">; (ii) another levy on excess revenues that low-cost power producers make from soaring electricity costs; and (iii)  a mandatory 5% cut in electricity use during peak price periods. The regulation introduces common measures to collect and redistribute the energy sector&rsquo;s surplus revenues to final customers.

For domestic installations, solar PV is installed on new homes, as one of the measures to achieve compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations. They are also installed on existing buildings through grant supports offer by Government, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).     </p>  <p>  The Government approved the Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS) in December 2021 to support 380 MW of new micro-generation by 2030 under the Climate Action Plan. This amounts to 60,000 homes and 9,000 non-domestic installations, such as small farms and businesses, schools and community groups etc, which would generate over 300 GWh of renewable electricity per annum, with the potential to abate 1.4 million tonnes of CO2eq over the lifetime of the installations.   </p>  <p>  Since 2018, the SEAI has supported the installation of domestic Solar PV systems for over 12,000 homes and with demand for the domestic Solar PV grant increasing significantly throughout the year, we expect that grant applications will exceed 12,600 in 2022 alone. Since the introduction of the MSS domestic grant in early 2022 applications levels are up 250% year on year. For 2023, the SEAI is forecasting to support over 12,500 homes and over 1,000 small businesses and community organisations.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the MSS offering grant support to domestic and non-domestic applicants for renewable installations up to 6kW, these applicants will also be eligible to avail of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff. As such, any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises of these microgenerators is now eligible for an export payment; which further supports the investment.</p></reply>

The programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008, as included in the National Development Plan. The Pathfinder programme has, to date, supported the retrofit of 41 schools across Ireland, with work on an additional 15 schools currently at various stages of progress. </p>  <p>  My Department's contribution to the 2022 schools initiative is over &euro;11 million, which will see 6 schools benefiting from a selection of energy efficiency works. The general principles and approach to school selection for the Programme include schools meeting Energy Monitoring and Reporting requirements, as well as demonstrating a strong and holistic commitment to energy management practices through participation in the SEAI and the Department of Education partnership initiative, Energy in Education Programme. The programme selection also seeks to enable various cross sections of school types and sizes, energy consumption profiles, different elements of construction type and different heritage/conservation requirements, where specific learnings are being targeted.

The new grants are the next phase in the Government&rsquo;s Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS) and are administered through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The scheme provides grant funding of up to &euro;2,400 towards the installation of solar PV technology up to a maximum of 6kWp, which is approximately 16 solar panels. This provides an opportunity for all areas of the non-domestic sector to not only reduce their electricity bills, but to visibly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and Ireland&rsquo;s broader climate action goals. </p><p>  Full details and how to apply are available at www.seai.ie . </p><p>  Moreover, with the introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG), any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises is now eligible for an export payment which further supports the investment.

The CRU (Commission for Regulation of Utilities) will consult on an implementation plan for the Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff, which will consists of a guaranteed export tariff support for new installations that is fixed for 15 years.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the whole aviation eco-system has experienced operational challenges with the recovery of passenger travel to close to pre-Covid levels, the root of which mainly lay in the significant staff resourcing issues facing the sector. Ireland is not unique in this regard.</p>  <p>  Dublin Airport raised an issue with the Department in relation to the validity of foreign driver's licenses for use in Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  The Department clarified that a person can drive here on a foreign licence for up to a year but only if they are a visitor (this is covered by an international convention). Under our national laws, if a person is resident here, they must have an Irish/EU licence to drive on public roads.</p>  <p>  If a person is resident in Ireland, for instance, on foot of a work permit, they must have an Irish or EU licence in order to drive here. Ireland has licence exchange agreements with a number of non-EU states and, in those cases, a person may exchange their national licence for an Irish licence if they are resident here. The Department informed Dublin Airport that Ireland does not have a licence exchange agreement with Brazil so those resident licence holders can not legally drive here (on Irish roads or airside) on their Brazilian licences.</p>  <p>  Under section 38 of the 1961 Road Traffic Act, it is an offence to drive a motorised vehicle in a public place without a driving licence. A state airport, under section 59 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1998, is a public place and a person driving a motorised vehicle in an airport must have the appropriate licence for that vehicle. </p>  <p>  A person resident here with a full but non-exchangeable licence can avail of a shorter process to obtaining an Irish licence, involving Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons only, instead of the 12 normally required, and will not have to wait the minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test.</p>  <p>  The issue has not been formally raised with my department by the ground handlers, however, the Department is aware that they have raised the issue with the Joint Oireachtas Committee. The Department understands that Dublin Airport has shared the position regarding the requirements for a valid driver's license to drive in a public place with the companies responsible for the ground handlers operations.</p></reply>

Since public health restrictions have eased, considerable progress has been made, and waiting times have reduced significantly.</p>  <p>  Pre Covid, the target national average wait for a test was ten weeks. On the eve of the pandemic, however, the actual waiting time was approximately six and a half weeks. This increased to 25 weeks during the pandemic. The pre-pandemic national average target wait of ten weeks was once again achieved by the end of 2021. Projections made early last year had estimated it would be February 2022 before this point was reached.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase in application volumes and learners becoming eligible to take their test since the start of the year as the economy once again reopened and many learners who availed of increased capacity in the Driver Theory Test are now becoming eligible.</p>  <p>  The operation of the national driving test service is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority (RSA), and in early 2022, the RSA conducted a review of the current and evolving needs of the driver tester service. This recommended that the number of permanent driver testers employed by the RSA should be raised from 100 to 130. Following due consideration, my Department gave approval for these additional personnel in June 2022. Recruitment is underway and the RSA hope to see new testers commence work before year end.</p>  <p>  Specific details regarding Clonmel test centre and waiting times are held by the RSA.

This is a serious matter and accordingly my department will continue to support all appropriate requests from the RSA for assistance. I recently met with the Authority to emphasise the importance of reducing the current test backlog as soon as possible and it has committed to providing me with weekly updates on the NCTS. Further, my officials are meeting weekly with RSA senior management to monitor progress in reducing test delays.</p><p>I am advised that customers seeking test appointments may contact the NCTS directly, by calling 01-4135992, or may avail of the priority waiting list function via the NCT website,<i>www.ncts.ie</i>. I understand that, in the majority of cases, these vehicle owners are provided with an appointment within 30 days.</p><p>I am also given to understand that the RSA has made An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na aware that some vehicle owners have had issues securing an appointment. Vehicle owners should carry proof that they are waiting for an NCT in their vehicle with them. However, vehicle owners and drivers are reminded that they are legally required to ensure their vehicles are in a roadworthy condition at all times. It remains an offence under Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 to drive a vehicle in a public place without having a valid certificate of roadworthiness and, as with all road traffic legislation, enforcement of this requirement continues to be a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

This is in line with the approach that has been taken with mature students who are in full-time third level education.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the NTA have already commenced the technical work on this matter, which is scheduled to be completed in the coming weeks, at which point those third level students aged 16, 17, and 18 will be able to order a Student Leap Card and avail of the discount.</p>  <p>  In light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded Deputy Lawless's specific question regarding the timeframe for widening  the scheme to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

The MSO determines and prescribes the required manning levels and crew qualifications required to safely navigate and operate vessels.  This requires that the MSO has responsibility for the regulation of hours of work and rest on-board all Irish flagged vessels in Ireland and abroad and for foreign flagged vessels in Ireland. This is necessary because the working arrangements on-board, including working hours, is intimately connected to the safe operation and navigation of vessel. This enables the MSO to adopt a comprehensive, integrated, and holistic approach to the totality of vessel safety including the human-vessel interface and human factors on-board. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) took a case against the Department of Justice and Equality and others seeking changes to or suspension of the Atypical Workers Scheme for non-EEA fishers on board certain Irish flagged fishing vessels.

That recommendation was to be implemented by appropriate legislative measures to be determined by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.  It is understood that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment intend to implement this recommendation through primary legislation.</p></reply>

AIS transponder equipment is used on ships to provide information about the vessel to other vessels and to coastal authorities. The AIS carriage requirement for fishing vessels in the 15m to 24m length range is set out in Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 640 of 2007. Regulation 146 paragraphs (6) and (7) of this Statutory Instrument requires an AIS to be fitted onboard which shall meet the performance standards drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The Marine Survey Office (MSO) implements compliance with these requirements by means of a survey and certification programme. Vessels which meet the requirements of the Regulations are issued with a Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate.</p>  <p>  The Sea Fisheries Administration of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine requires a fishing vessel to hold such a Fishing Vessel Safety Certificate demonstrating compliance with the statutory requirements before the issue of a Sea-Fishing Boat Licence. The MSO enforces the requirements during its flag state and port state obligations and also enforces the requirements by other methods such as the imposition of deficiencies and detention of vessels, with prosecutions being sought in more serious cases. The offence in the Regulations relates to the non-carriage of the required AIS and there has been no such prosecutions.</p></reply>

The ten-year rule was adopted in recognition of the need to strike a balance between achieving standards that offer the customer confidence, comfort and safety, and allowing industry members to operate successfully.  I would note that the Irish 10-year rule for standard taxis and hackneys is not particularly onerous by comparison with other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys are permitted to operate up to 15 years of age. No maximum permissible age is prescribed for limousines in recognition of both the vintage nature of many of these vehicles and their generally reduced mileage.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, standard age limits for taxis and hackneys were extended on several occasions, and are currently extended through to the end of 2022.  This change helped ensure no operator exited the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.</p>  <p>  Within the last month a series of global circumstances has, in the NTA&rsquo;s view, considerably worsened the capability of taxi and hackney licence holders to secure new vehicles, with lead times of one year not uncommon already. Therefore, the NTA has recently proposed to temporarily extend the maximum permissible age for taxis and hackneys with a current final operation date in 2023 and 2024, such that no current vehicle licence holder is forced out of the industry because a replacement vehicle cannot be purchased.</p>  <p>  The NTA opened a public consultation on this proposal on 19 September 2022, which runs until 12 October 2022.  Details and submission forms are available on the NTA website.</p></reply>

It is not intended, therefore, that tenants of local authorities, tenants in receipt of the Housing Assistance Payment, tenants who are supported by the Rental Accommodation Scheme or who are renting from Approved Housing Bodies will be entitled to claim the relief. </p><p>A number of the above conditions applied in the past in respect of the previous &ldquo;<i>Allowance for Rent paid</i>&rdquo; measure. </p><p>Qualification/compliance requirements are continuing to be worked through at present and the aim is to have them finalised in the coming days in the context of the preparation of the Finance Bill. </p></reply>

That release put the number of people deemed to be in the rental sector (excluding social housing tenants) at just over 600,000. Importantly, due to the method by which the data is collected (PPS numbers), the total is deemed to be overwhelmingly comprised of adults, as well as an underestimate of the actual number of people renting.</p>  <p>  There are just over 100,000 people in supported tenancies (HAP, RAS, AHBs). When these are excluded the number of eligible tenants falls to c. 500,000. Further, according to the CSO, some 75 per cent of tenants in their dataset have employee, self-employed or director income, which would allow them to claim the relief where the other conditions attached to the credit are met. That brings the estimated number of eligible tenants to just under 400,000. Given the acknowledged underestimate of the base figure and the need for caution given the huge uncertainties around the data, an estimate of 400,000 was deemed an appropriate figure to use to cost this measure.</p>  <p>  Subject to a number of conditions being met, the rent tax credit will be available in respect of rent paid during the course of the 2022 year of assessment and subsequent years. I am informed by Revenue that taxpayers will be required to complete an Income Tax Return in order to make a claim in respect of rent paid during the 2022 year of assessment. </p>  <p>  Income Tax Returns for the 2022 year of assessment will be available for completion and submission in early January 2023. Further details in relation to the information and supporting documentation taxpayers will be required to provide when making a claim in respect of rent paid during 2022 will be published to the Revenue.ie website in early January 2023. Details in relation to the claim process for rent paid during the 2023 and subsequent years of assessment will also be published in due course.</p></reply>

On Budget Day this Tuesday, Minister McGrath and I announced a &ldquo;cost-of-living&rdquo; package of once-off measures worth &euro;4.1 billion. This was accompanied by budgetary measures for 2023 worth &euro;6.9 billion.</p>  <p>  The total size of Budget 2023 is &euro;11 billion. This package builds on the fiscal supports the Government has already provided, with the aim of helping families, individuals and businesses deal with the rising cost of living.</p>  <p>  The Local Property Tax (LPT) was introduced in 2013 to provide a stable and sustainable funding base for local authorities and is a significant base-broadening measure. LPT has yielded over &euro;4 billion for Local Authorities since its introduction.</p>  <p>  All property owners benefit from the essential local services LPT helps to fund. The proper functioning of these services is important for every community and household. If the tax were abolished, the funding gap would ultimately need to be met by the Exchequer in the form of increased general taxation. For these reasons, I do not plan to abolish the Local Property Tax. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 provides for a cut in the main rate of the tax and widening of the valuation bands to make the changes affordable in accordance with the Programme for Government commitment. As these changes were implemented for the 2022 LPT year, this meant that the majority of homeowners saw either a decrease or no change in their LPT liability. Where increases arose, the majority were by a single band. </p>  <p>  The LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax. A qualifying person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property, and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.</p>  <p>  It is also possible to apply for a deferral on the grounds of hardship if a person suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant loss or expense. Further information regarding the deferral of LPT is available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/deferral-of-payment/index.aspx</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it has engaged extensively with residential property owners who are experiencing financial difficulties, to agree flexible LPT payment arrangements that best suit their circumstances and avoid unnecessary hardship, and Revenue has assured me that this will continue to be the case.</p>  <p>  Any property owners experiencing financial difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options both in respect of 2022 liabilities and for any previous years where liabilities remain outstanding. The full range of payment options, which includes phased arrangements, are available to property owners on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/index.aspx.</p>  <p>  The LPT payment compliance rate for 2022 currently stands at 96%. Payment of the LPT for 2023 is not due until January 2023, at the earliest.</p>  <p>  Finally, property owners experiencing difficulties in meeting their LPT obligations can contact Revenue through MyAccount at www.revenue.ie or by calling the LPT helpline (01) 7383626.</p></reply>

Its primary purpose was to widen the tax base and to provide a steady income to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services.  </p>  <p>  The USC is an individualised tax, meaning that a person&rsquo;s liability to the tax is determined on the basis of his/her own individual income and personal circumstances. The USC is applied at a low rate on a wide base, which ensures that it is a stable and sustainable source of revenue for the State.</p>  <p>  The USC, like the Income Levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments, such as the contributory and non-contributory State pensions.  However occupational pensions, are liable to the USC if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold. Currently individuals with incomes of less than &euro;13,000 are exempt from USC, which can include modest occupational pensions. </p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI. In my view, a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution but according to their means, is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term. As such, I have no current plans to amend the current treatment of pensions for USC purposes. </p></reply>

This measure was initially extended in Budget 2022 to 31 August 2022 at a further estimated cost of &euro;251m. It was then  extended again for another six months until 28 February 2023 at an additional estimated cost of &euro;250m. This was done to provide further support to the tourism and hospitality sectors over the busy November/December period and into the early New Year. </p>  <p>  No further extension to this measure is envisaged so the rate which applies to these sectors will revert to 13.5% from 1 March 2023.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that a review was undertaken of the 9% VAT rate in advance of Budget 2019.

While both Revenue data and preliminary Census 2022 data show that vacancy lies within a range that is considered to be in line with a functioning housing market, it is important that the Government acts to ensure all viable housing stock is made available for use.</p><p>Accordingly a new Vacant Homes Tax (VHT) will be introduced in 2023. The VHT will be self-assessed and administered by the Revenue Commissioners. The measure aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand, rather than raise revenue.</p><p>The tax will apply to long-term vacant residential property and will be paid by property owners. A property will be considered vacant for the purposes of the tax if it is occupied for less than 30 days in a 12-month period.</p><p>The VHT will operate by requiring owners of vacant residential properties to file an annual return declaring that their properties were vacant in the applicable 12-month period and indicating the LPT valuation band/valuation that applies to the property. This will be used to assess their VHT liability.</p><p>The VHT will share some features with the existing Local Property Tax. The tax will apply to buildings which are residential properties for the purposes of LPT. This means that it will not apply to derelict or properties unsuitable for use as a dwelling which are not captured under the LPT system. </p><p>The tax will be charged at a rate equal to three times the property&rsquo;s existing base Local Property Tax liability &ndash; that is, the liability before the application of the Local Adjustment Factor (LAF). </p><p>There will be a number of exemptions to ensure property owners are not unfairly charged for temporary periods of vacancy with genuine reasons. These will include:</p><p>- properties recently sold or currently listed for sale or rent;</p><p>- properties vacant due to the occupier&rsquo;s illness or long-term care; and </p><p>- properties vacant as a result of significant refurbishment work. </p><p>It is anticipated that the tax will come into effect in 2023. Further detail on the operation of the tax will become available following the publication of the Finance Bill, on 20 October.</p></reply>

That release put the number of people deemed to be in the rental sector (excluding social housing tenants) at just over 600,000. Importantly, due to the method by which the data is collected (PPS numbers), the total is deemed to be overwhelmingly comprised of adults, as well as an underestimate of the actual number of people renting.</p>  <p>  There are just over 100,000 people in supported tenancies (HAP, RAS, AHBs). When these are excluded the number of eligible tenants falls to c. 500,000. Further, according to the CSO, some 75 per cent of tenants in their dataset have employee, self-employed or director income, which would allow them to claim the credit. That brings the estimated number of eligible tenants to just under 400,000. Given the acknowledged underestimate of the base figure and the need for caution given the huge uncertainties around the data, an estimate of 400,000 was deemed an appropriate figure to use to cost this measure.</p>  <p>  The rent tax credit will be available in respect of rent paid during the course of the 2022 year of assessment and subsequent years. I am informed by Revenue that taxpayers will be required to complete an Income Tax Return in order to make a claim in respect of rent paid during the 2022 year of assessment. </p>  <p>  Income Tax Returns for the 2022 year of assessment will be available for completion and submission in early January 2023. Further details in relation to the information and supporting documentation taxpayers will be required to provide when making a claim in respect of rent paid during 2022 will be published to the Revenue.ie website in early January 2023. Details in relation to the claim process for rent paid during the 2023 and subsequent years of assessment will also be published in due course.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is not proposed that the rent tax credit will be refundable. However, I am informed that a person earning less than the minimum wage annualised in either 2022 or 2023 (assuming the usual metric of 39 hours per week for 52 weeks per year) will be in a position to fully claim the relief.</p></reply>

As such, they do not adjust for projected levels of inflation but instead compare a baseline scenario of no-policy change against a reform scenario solely incorporating the budgetary policy changes. This is the case for both the Cost of Living package and the more traditional tax and welfare measures announced in Budget 2023. </p><p>However, the analysis published by the ESRI at their Post-Budget Briefing on 30 September does include comparisons with a hypothetical inflation-adjusted scenario. Specifically, the ESRI examined the distributional impact of <i>Budget 2023</i>compared to the impacts on income if the tax and welfare system was indexed to an inflation rate of 7.1 per cent.  </p><p>The ESRI Budget 202<i>3</i>analysis also included additional measures that were not included in the analysis published by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. These measures include:  the universal childcare subsidy, GP visit cards, free school books, and reduced VAT on newspapers. </p><p>The ESRI&rsquo;s Post- Budget Briefing, with relevant distributional graphs, is available at: </p><p>esri.newsweaver.com/enewsletter/45ywtphvv12ciwo13848jk/external?email=true&amp;amp;a=5&amp;amp;p=62168701&amp;amp;t=26436355.</p><p>Overall, the ESRI&rsquo;s analysis shows that, once Cost of Living measures are allowed for, all households see gains in their inflation-adjusted weekly disposable income as a result of <i>Budget 2023 &ndash; </i>see <b>figure 1 attached</b>. Decile 1 sees the largest gain at just under 1&frac12; per cent. Notably, the ESRI conclude that &quot;the Government's approach to insulating households from the recent rise in energy prices has been effective.&quot;</p><p>Again, my Department&rsquo;s analysis of the one-off measures that are being introduced during the remainder of 2022, as published in figure 2 of <i>Budget 2023: Beyond GDP &ndash; Quality of Life Assessment</i>, was performed on a nominal basis. In terms of the ESRI analysis, it is difficult to undertake inflation-adjusted analysis on a partial-year basis. The ESRI therefore opted to examine the tax and welfare measures in <i>Budgets 2021 and 2022</i>, including the one-off measures introduced this year. </p><p>The Institute&rsquo;s analysis shows that the lowest income deciles were largely insulated against inflation over the period since 2020 <i>&ndash; </i>see <b>figure 2 attached</b>. Overall, the distributional impact was progressive, with the first two deciles gaining the most in disposable income. More broadly, the ESRI analysis highlights the impact of the one-off measures both this year and next in cushioning incomes, particularly in low-income households. </p></reply>

Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any CAT is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of the relevant Group threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess.  There are three Group thresholds:</p>  <p>  - the Group A threshold (currently &euro;335,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) of the disponer;</p>  <p>  - the Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer;</p>  <p>  - the Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, where a person receives a gift or inheritance from his or her aunt or uncle, the Group B threshold of &euro;32,500 will apply.  CAT will be payable by the person at a rate of 33% to the extent that the benefit received, when aggregated with any prior gift or inheritance received since 5 December 1991, exceeds this threshold, unless a specific relief or exemption applies.  </p>  <p>  There is an exemption from CAT, provided for in section 84 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, for gifts and inheritances taken exclusively for the purpose of discharging qualifying expenses of an individual who is &lsquo;permanently incapacitated&rsquo; by reason of physical or mental infirmity.</p>  <p>  Permanently incapacitated in this context, means being unable to support oneself by earning an income from working. Qualifying expenses mean expenses relating to medical care including the cost of maintenance in connection with such medical care. A gift or inheritance of this nature will be exempt from CAT where Revenue is satisfied that it will be used for such purposes.  Accordingly, if an aunt or uncle through a legal will leaves large sums of monies to a niece or nephew, the relief will be available to the niece or nephew if he or she is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity and it can be established that the monies were taken exclusively for the purposes of discharging the medical expenses of the niece or nephew.   </p>  <p>  As noted above, the gift or inheritance must be taken exclusively for the purposes of discharging the medical expenses of the incapacitated person. In this regard, Revenue will consider the intention of the person providing the gift or inheritance in determining whether the exemption is available, by reference to appropriate evidence. While such evidence may include the existence of a trust to provide for the ongoing medical care of an individual, Revenue may also accept other evidence, such as a letter of wishes accompanying a will.  </p>  <p>  Further information on this exemption is available in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Manual Part 22, which can be found on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/capital-acquisitions-tax/cat-part22.pdf</p></reply>

In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, unless they fall within the categories of goods and services specified in Annex III of the VAT Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate of VAT. The EU VAT Directive also allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions on certain goods and services not provided for in Annex III. Currently Ireland has a standard VAT rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%. Ireland is also permitted to retain some historic VAT arrangements, under strict conditions.</p>  <p>  Services consisting of the care of the human body supplied in the course of a health studio business or similar business, such as a yoga studio, are liable to VAT at 13.5% on the basis of a historical derogation. In the absence of this derogation, these business would pay the standard 23% rate of VAT. Unfortunately, karate classes do not fall within the aforementioned derogation, thus explaining why they pay a higher rate of VAT.</p></reply>

Further detail on this measure will be made available on the publication of the Finance Bill on 20 October.</p><p>  The introduction of this tax follows from my Department's commitment under <i>Housing for All </i>to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 facilitated the collection on data on vacant property through LPT returns.</p><p>A preliminary analysis of the vacancy data was published by Revenue in July this year, following the LPT revaluation in November 2021, and can be found on their website: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/local-property-tax/lpt-stats-2022/index.aspx </p><p>In arriving at the estimates for the Budget documentation,  certain assumptions were made based on the Revenue data and took into account the number of long-term vacant properties (those unoccupied for greater than 12 months), their valuation band, as well as their reasons for lying vacant which may correspond with an exemption from the tax. It is tentatively estimated that less than 15% of the total properties reported as vacant may be in scope of the tax.  </p><p>As stated in my Budget speech, this measure aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand, rather than raise revenue The estimated yield is low, as I anticipate this tax will influence behaviour and lead to property owners putting their vacant properties to more effective use. As such, the number of properties who will be subject to this tax and the eventual yield may be lower than the estimates provided.</p></reply>

All other instruments, if liable to stamp duty, must be stamped by Revenue. The requirement to submit instruments to Revenue for stamping was provided for in section 12 SDCA 1999 and subsequently by the e-Stamping Regulations for the electronic filing of instruments, which came into operation on 1 June 2011.</p>  <p>  Section 127 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999 provides that an unstamped instrument may not be used in evidence or for any purpose except as evidence in criminal proceedings or in civil proceedings by Revenue to recover stamp duty.  Accordingly, I am advised by Revenue that where there is a requirement to have an instrument stamped by Revenue and that requirement is not satisfied, apart from the circumstances outlined, section 127 provides that the instrument may not be used in evidence, including to prove title to the property which is the subject of the instrument. Banks and other bodies are not excluded from these requirements.</p>  <p>  Where a liability to stamp duty arises on an instrument of assignment of a chose-in-action and the instrument is not stamped, then, in accordance with section 127 SDCA 1999, the instrument may not be used in evidence or for any purpose except as evidence in criminal proceedings or in civil proceedings by Revenue to recover stamp duty. Prior to 7 December 2006, stamp duty was chargeable on debts such as debentures and bonds including mortgages securing loans on property situated in the State and any subsequent transfer of such debts where the amount secured exceeded &euro;254,000.  Section 100 Finance Act 2007 terminated this charge for such &lsquo;debt&rsquo; documents executed after this date. </p>  <p>  Regarding Dail Question  No. 242 (Ref: 48543/22), I am also advised by Revenue that as stamp duty is a self-assessed duty, Stamp Certificates issue automatically once the return has been filed and any payment due, including, interest, surcharges or penalties, has been paid in full. </p>  <p>  Revenue is obliged to treat personal and business information of all taxpayers in the strictest of confidence and therefore it is not in a position to publish copies of certificates. Revenue will, however, provide a breakdown of the number of certificates issued under each instrument to the Deputy in the coming weeks. If the Deputy has a concern relating to a specific transaction and sends details of that transaction to my Department, I can provide the details to Revenue for further examination.</p></reply>

Pillar Two of the agreement provides for a new global minimum effective rate of tax, and therefore consideration was required as to how tax credits, such as the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, would operate within such a system.</p><p>The signatory countries, including Ireland, recognise the valuable economic and societal role played by research and development activities, and the Model Rules therefore provide that &ldquo;Qualified Refundable Credits&rdquo; may be treated as income, rather than as reducing tax paid, thereby preserving the value of R&amp;amp;D tax credits in the context of the new minimum effective tax rate calculations.</p><p>A similar concept of a &quot;fully refundable&quot; tax credit was also introduced in U.S. Foreign Tax Credit regulations earlier this year.  </p><p>These developments were considered in my Department's corporation tax Tax Strategy Group paper earlier this year.</p><p>In order to align the operation of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit with new international standards, I announced a number of amendments to the credit in Budget 2023.  The changes all relate to the manner and timing of payment of the tax credit and do not affect the quantum of credit that a company is entitled to claim. As a result, the changes are net neutral in budgetary terms. The changes are as outlined below:</p><p>- The current system of offset of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit against corporation tax liabilities and payment in three payable instalments is being changed to a new, fixed three-year payment system.</p><p>- A company will have an option to call for payment of their eligible R&amp;amp;D tax credit or to request for it to be offset against other tax liabilities.</p><p>- Existing caps on the payable element of the credit are being removed.</p><p>- The first &euro;25,000 of a claim will now be payable in full in the first year, to provide a cash-flow benefit for smaller R&amp;amp;D projects and encourage more companies to engage with the regime. </p><p>- Transitional measures will be in place for one year, to smooth the transition to the new payment system for companies that are already engaged in research &amp;amp; development activities.</p></reply>

The objective of the KDB is to encourage companies to develop IP in Ireland and thereby engage in substantive operations that have a high &lsquo;value-add&rsquo; for the Irish economy. The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports that Ireland offers to create a business-friendly environment.</p><p>The KDB provides for an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax on income arising from qualifying assets. Qualifying assets in respect of the KDB are:</p><p>- Computer programs;</p><p>- Inventions protected by a qualifying patent; or</p><p>- Certified inventions for SMEs.</p><p>To qualify for the KDB, the qualifying assets must result from qualifying R&amp;amp;D activities carried out by the company in Ireland. This meets the OECD&rsquo;s &lsquo;modified nexus standard&rsquo;, an approach which provides that a taxpayer may only benefit from an IP regime to the extent it can clearly show that it incurred expenditure that resulted in the qualifying asset(s).</p><p>The KDB regime is currently available to companies for accounting periods commencing before 1 January 2023.  I announced in Budget 2023 that Finance Bill 2022 will provide for the extension of this sunset provision to accounting periods commencing before 1 January 2027.  </p><p>In preparation for the implementation of the Pillar Two Subject to Tax Rule (STTR), Finance Bill 2022 will also provide for an increase in the effective rate of the KDB to 10%, to be brought into effect by commencement order when agreement is reached at the OECD on implementation timelines for the STTR. </p><p>This will allow for the retention of the KDB incentive within the Irish tax system, where it will continue to deliver a benefit for those companies that are eligible to claim it, while also putting in place necessary preparations for implementation of the Pillar Two agreement.</p></reply>

It will incorporate priorities that were articulated in the Public Service Innovation Strategy, <i>Making Innovation Real</i>in addition to aligning with the ambitions set out in the programme of renewal for the Civil Service (Civil Service Renewal 2030) and its recently published three year Action Plan (Civil Service Renewal 2024).</p><p>Additionally, in March 2022, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer in my Department published a new Public Service Digital Strategy '<i>Connecting Government 2030: A Digital and ICT Strategy for Ireland&rsquo;s Public Service'</i>, which articulates my Department&rsquo;s ambitions for digital reform by further embedding digitisation and the increased delivery of digital services to the public.</p><p>As regards the drive for more value for money all public organisations are required to treat public funds with care, and to ensure that the best possible value for money is obtained whenever public money is being spent or invested. This is in accordance with the Public Spending Code. Moreover, Action 5 of <i>Our Public Service 2020 </i>(Action 5) emphasises the need to ensure value-for-money principles are adhered to across the Public Service. </p><p>As part of this broader approach to ensuring value for money, the introduction of shared services and centralised procurement in earlier phases of reform have been further integrated in public service operations and expanded into new areas. These expansions will continue apace and this Department is actively exploring new areas and mechanisms to further embed reforms and efficiencies that will enhance the cost-effectiveness of public services; for example, through greater use of opportunities presented through digitalisation, intelligent automation, innovation and the implementation of new ways of working and service design.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that, as part of the Public Service Pay Agreement &lsquo;<i>Building Momentum</i>&rsquo; (and any extension thereof), parties are committed to the ongoing reform and development of public services to meet the changing needs of citizens, communities, businesses and the staff who deliver our public services.</p></reply>

I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, which is to ensure that the first revaluation of commercial and industrial properties in all rating authority areas in over 160 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue. </p>  <p>  The latest phase of the programme is comprised of the revaluation of rateable properties in the rating authority areas of Clare, Donegal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown (second revaluation), Galway, Kerry and Mayo County Councils and Galway City Council. This phase has already been postponed due to the Covid 19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability across ratepayers based on modern valuations and economic circumstances. In local authorities that have not yet been revalued, their valuations and, by extension, their rates liabilities are based on economic circumstances and property values that pertained in 1988. </p>  <p>  Revaluation ensures equity and fairness in the rateable valuation system. Following revaluation there is a much closer and uniform relationship between contemporary rental values and the commercial rates liability of properties. In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the business rates burden relative to the modern rental value of the property that they occupy.</p>  <p>  While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the Local Authority as the rates income of each Local Authority is capped in the year following a revaluation. </p>  <p>  In those local authority areas revalued to date, most ratepayers post revaluation have seen their rates liability reduce. The last completed phase of revaluation comprised the revaluation of more than 30,000 rateable properties in the local authority areas of Cavan, Fingal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils. The revaluation resulted in reduced rates for some 67% of ratepayers.</p></reply>

In preparing these plans, local authorities were asked to assess the level of housing demand with affordability constraint projected for their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) tool and plan their provision accordingly.  Both Offaly and Laois County Councils submitted initial draft Plans to my Department in December last and published their final Plans in July.  </p>  <p>  18 local authorities, including Laois, with a strong and identified affordable housing need were asked to include planned affordable housing delivery in their Action Plans.  I have also set five-year Affordable Housing delivery targets for those local authorities. Local Authorities will advertise affordable purchase schemes in accordance with legislation as they become available and individuals will be able to make applications to the local authority in the manner prescribed. </p>  <p>  The level of affordably constrained need in Offaly is assessed at below 5%, although some localised affordability issues may arise in certain towns within both counties.</p>  <p>  It is possible for local authorities, including Offaly County Council, to undertake HNDA analysis at sub county level to determine whether a need for affordable housing schemes is evident in specific towns/areas.  The Affordable Housing Fund subsidy is available to support affordable housing purchase in schemes located in large or key towns per National Planning Framework objectives and to  ensure that provision is aligned with where need is concentrated. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency are available to assist all local authorities in the consideration of schemes and the preparation of applications.  My Department has yet to receive an AHF funding application to support affordable housing delivery from Laois or Offaly.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I recently announced the &lsquo;Ready to Build&rsquo; Scheme. The scheme will be funded from the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites available in towns and villages to potential purchasers for the building by the purchaser of a principal private residence. The sites will be sold at a discounted rate of up to &euro;30,000 from the market value. The discount will be determined by the cost of servicing the site.  This will facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025 and can be availed of by both Laois County Council and Offaly County Council to help meet affordable housing need.</p>  <p>  Finally, the First Home Scheme, launched in July this year, supports first-time buyers in purchasing new houses and apartments in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. The Scheme aims to support in the region of 8,000 households in acquiring new homes in the private market in the years 2022 to 2026 with an overall budget of &euro;400 million.  The scheme is available nationwide.</p></reply>

Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add real vibrancy and provide new accommodation in those areas.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is a key initiative which underpins these policy objectives set out in Pathway Four of Housing for All.</p><p>  Schemes under the Fund, which are delivered by local authorities, will provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes.</p><p>  On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence. A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.</p><p>  On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme, also funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser. </p><p>  When the Fund was launched, I committed to ongoing review of the schemes under it. Feedback on the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme to date has been overwhelmingly positive, with 169 applications submitted by the start of September.</p><p>  Given that a key objective of Pathway 4 of Housing for All is to ensure that the houses we already have are being fully used, I have decided to extend the eligibility for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas. </p><p>Both schemes under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will continue to be only for those who intend to occupy the property as their principal private residence. Officials in my Department will work with the Vacant Homes Officers (VHO) in each local authority in the coming weeks to update the details of the Grant, with a view to the expanded scheme being available in November.</p><p>Vacant Homes Officers in each local authority will be available to provide advice and information on the schemes and the application process.</p></reply>

A move to this model will lead to an increased surplus for those authorities with LPT income above their funding baseline. </p><p>These authorities shall now retain a greater proportion of that surplus for their own use in 2023; an increase from 20% of the overall yield this year to 22.5% next year. The remainder of the increased surplus will be used to self-fund housing, roads or other services in the local area. The self-funding requirement will be based on the total expected level of LPT in each local authority area before any application of a local variation decision and will not be adjusted if the basic rate of LPT is varied.</p><p>Every local authority has the power to vary the basic rate of LPT by up to 15% and the decision to vary the rate is a matter for the local authority itself. If a Local Authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate downwards (by up to 15%), the resultant loss in LPT income is reflected in a proportionate reduction in discretionary income for the Council.  Likewise, if a local authority decides to vary the rate upwards, there will be a proportionate increase in such income.</p></reply>

A comprehensive review of the baselines could not commence in time for the 2023 Local Property Tax (LPT) allocation process without reliable and up-to-date data; such as preliminary census data and updated LPT yield data, following re-valuation. </p>  <p>  However, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future, some changes have already been made to the LPT Allocation model that will take effect from 2023, namely:</p>  <p>  (1) 100% of the estimated yield will now be retained locally within the local authority area where it is collected;</p>  <p>  (2) Equalisation funding will now be fully met by the Exchequer, to ensure that all authorities receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their Baseline.  This will be at a cost of &euro;118m to the exchequer in 2023;</p>  <p>  (3) Those authorities with a surplus, i.e. with LPT income above their baseline, shall now retain a greater proportion of that surplus for their own use; to a maximum of 22.5% of the pre-variation yield as opposed to 20% in 2022.  The remainder of the surplus will be used to self-fund housing and/or roads services expenditure in the local area. </p>  <p>  My Department intends to commence a comprehensive review of the LPT allocation model shortly, with a particular focus on the baseline funding of individual authorities.  This review is expected to be concluded in time for the 2024 LPT allocations.  It is intended to establish a working group comprising key stakeholders and, in course of this review, submissions will also be invited for consideration from other interested parties.   Previous reviews and studies of local authority baseline funding will also be assessed and considered.  It is intended that the updated census data, including population growth, will be taken into account in the context of this review.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that LPT yield has remained largely unchanged following the 2021 revaluation by Revenue.  Any additional funding requests for the Local Government sector must be agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, and will be considered within the parameters of the national fiscal and budgetary situation, and the competing priorities presenting themselves currently at a national level.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department is aware of the current financial environment in which local authorities are now operating and, in recognition of the ongoing pressures, additional support of &euro;60m has been recently secured to assist the sector.  The purpose of this additional funding will be to assist local authorities in meeting the increasing costs involved in providing a wide range of services.  This funding is additional to the contribution of &euro;333m towards LPT equalisation, payroll and other miscellaneous schemes in 2023.</p></reply>

This type of application will relate to the supplement to the register then in force, rather than any draft in preparation.  </p>  <p>  While the process has served the country well for many years, the Electoral Reform Act 2022 provides for a more responsive electoral registration process as part of a range of significant electoral reforms outlined in the Programme for Government.   Among the changes to the process are the introduction of rolling (continuously updated) registration; the simplification of forms and the use of PPSNs in the registration process.  These changes mean that electors and potential electors will be able to apply to the registration authority to be included or to update their registration details at any time.  Many of these applications will be possible using a single online application, though a paper form will remain available for those who wish to use it. </p>  <p>  In order to prepare for the commencement of the legislation, work to update the systems used by registration authorities is underway, and is expected to be completed shortly.</p></reply>

Kilmainham Gaol is a national monument in my ownership and I am responsible for policy to ensure its long-term conservation and for the issue of Ministerial Consent under the Acts with respect to works at or in its vicinity. </p>  <p>  The question of exhuming the remains of the Invincibles and removing them from Kilmainham Gaol to the Republican Plot at Glasnevin was suggested a number of years ago by the late historian, Dr. Shane Kenna. It has also been the subject of a number of calls within various County Councils, including with the Motion raised in Dublin City Council. In parallel, the contrary view has also been expressed by other parties that the resting place should not be disturbed.</p>  <p>  I do not have a direct role in relation to any decision in principle on whether the remains should be disinterred for reburial elsewhere. However, Ministerial Consent under Section 14 of the National Monuments Act would be required and there are a number of challenges that would be involved that would need to be considered before any viable proposal could proceed, including the appropriateness of such. Notwithstanding any grant of consent under Section 14, it should be anticipated that an exhumation licence under section 46 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948 would also be required. </p>  <p>  The fact that the bodies were buried in quicklime and that there may be other remains of executed prisoners potentially in the same area is a significant complicating factor, which would make accurate identification of remains difficult. The Office of Public Works (OPW) also has a specific function in the matter as the statutory authority responsible for managing Kilmainham Gaol. There have been ongoing discussions between my Department and the OPW on this issue over the last few years, however this is ultimately a matter which is outside my remit. </p></reply>

This input complements the work of my Department&rsquo;s team of Marine Advisors and Marine License Vetting Committee.</p><p>The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021, enacted in December 2021, provides for the establishment of a new state agency, to be known as the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA), which will be responsible for regulating development and activity in Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area.</p><p>MARA will be responsible for:</p><p>- the granting of all Maritime Area Consents, or MACs, for the maritime area</p><p>- marine licensing for specified activities</p><p>- compliance and enforcement of MACs, licences and offshore development consents</p><p>- administration of the Foreshore consent portfolio of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage</p><p>The new regulatory authority, which will be based in Wexford, will be responsible for assessing applications for consents in the maritime area prior to projects applying for planning permission. For example: offshore wind projects, water and waste water infrastructure, bridges, marinas, coastal protection works, flood relief works and undersea telecommunications cables and power interconnectors.</p><p>MARA&rsquo;s regulatory role will also encompass granting licences for activities in the maritime area (including environmental surveys), and ensuring robust compliance through enforcement measures.

In response, in February 2021, I established a Working Group to examine the matter. The Group was chaired by former Donegal County Council CEO Seamus Neely.</p><p>I received the comprehensive report of the Working Group on 28 July titled <i>Defects in Apartments - Report of the Working Group to Examine Defects in Housing</i>, and I published it straight away.</p><p>On 27 September, I brought a Memorandum to Government to inform Government of the content of the report and of the next steps that I will be taking.</p><p>In that context, I will now, in consultation with Government colleagues, develop options with a view to providing support to homeowners who find themselves in a difficult financial situation through no fault of their own.</p><p>Firstly, an inter&ndash;departmental/agency group will be established to bring forward specific proposals to Government by the end of the year. As such, in response to Deputy O'Donovan, there is no application system in place at present.  </p><p>In addition, an advisory group to develop a Code of Practice will be established to provide guidance to building professionals and local authority building control / fire services, including guidance on interim safety measures, in line with Recommendation 8 of the Working Group&rsquo;s report and in the context of the Fire Services Acts.</p><p>I also intend on liaising with key stakeholders such as homeowner representatives and the insurance sector, as matters progress.</p><p>On 27 September I wrote to the organisation referred to by Deputy Shortall to inform them of this progress. My Department is also engaging with the Housing Agency for the provision of advice in relation to implementation of the recommendations of the Report.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the Minister for Finance announced the introduction of a 10% levy on concrete blocks and other concrete products, with an expected annual yield of &euro;80m on 27 September. This will provide a sustainable contribution from the construction sector towards the costs of dealing with construction defects over the coming years.  </p></reply>

Her final report recognised that local government structures should be reflective of the society in which we live. The ability to serve as a councillor should be one that is available to all. It should not be exclusively for those with independent means or for those who perform the role in a full-time capacity. </p><p>Ms. Moorhead's review expressed concern that placing a statutory obligation on employers to provide extra leave to employees who are councillors would place an extra burden on businesses and make councillors less attractive as employees. She considered that requiring employers to give employees who are councillors additional leave would therefore not be feasible.</p><p>I welcome the fact that some public bodies already have in place policies and procedures to facilitate employees who are serving councillors. It is questionable, however, whether such policies could be extended to the private sector by way of a code of practice as the Local Government Act 2001 does not provide any statutory basis for this. </p><p>Improved financial supports for councillors recommended by the Moorhead Report have already been given effect and this will help to better support councillors who may, for example, have to take occasional short unpaid absences from employment. A range of enhanced non-pay supports are also being developed by my Department in consultation with key stakeholders, including administrative supports, improved training, flexible meeting times, improved use of technological solutions, etc.</p><p>It is also worth noting that members of the public can also be actively involved in local government through the Strategic Policy Committee (SPC) system, where membership is drawn not only from councillors but also from various sectors relevant to the work of the committees. Other structures, such as Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) and Public Participation Networks (PPNs) also allow members of the public to participate through formal structures. </p></reply>

The review was conducted by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The review, which examined inter alia the efficiency of the current banding model and income limits applicable to local authorities, has been completed and I have recently approved implementation of its recommendations. This included the commissioning of work to scope and develop options for a revised or new social housing income eligibility model. This work will commence shortly under the aegis of the Housing Agency who have been tasked with commissioning it. It is expected that the work will be complete by the end of 2022.</p><p>Pending completion of this work, I have also approved changes to the social housing income eligibility bands. Five local authorities - Carlow, Clare, Galway County, Laois and Westmeath - will be moved from Band 3 to Band 2. Accordingly, the baseline income eligibility threshold for these areas will increase from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000. The change reflects the movement in rents in recent years in these areas and will ensure local authority areas with similar accommodation costs continue to be grouped together in the respective bands. The changes came into effect from 1 October 2022. </p><p>It is now appropriate to await the report I referred to before considering the appropriate income threshold levels for all counties, and the potential impact of any changes that might arise.</p></reply>

Significant funding has been secured and is being made available by Government to support delivery of affordable housing for purchase or for cost rental by local authorities, AHBs and by the LDA. </p>  <p>  The LDA has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which is expected to bring essential more long-term stability to the Irish housing market.

For 2023, I have confirmed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that I am seeking full capital carryover of 10%, amounting to &euro;340m.  The details of the source and subsequent allocation of that funding will be published in the REV later this year.  At this stage, I have signalled that &euro;240m of the carryover will be applied to the Housing programme.</p></reply>

The strategy sets out, over four pathways, a broad suite of measures to achieve its policy objectives together with a financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4 billion per annum.</p>  <p>  The suite of measures under the pathway to addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock includes measures funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe Fund and &euro;30 million in funding has been allocated to the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund in 2023.  </p>  <p>  Under the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) umbrella, being delivered by local authorities, funding is made available for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages and  in a sustainable way.</p>  <p>  Given that a key objective of Pathway 4 of Housing for All is to ensure that the houses we already have are being fully used, I have decided to extend the eligibility for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas.</p>  <p>  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Scheme supports the building of apartments for sale to owner-occupiers. The Scheme aims to bridge the current &ldquo;Viability Gap&rdquo; between the cost of building apartments and the market sale price (where the cost of building is greater).  The scheme is targeted principally at activating planning permissions already in place for such homes.</p>  <p>  The scheme launched on the 10th May with an Expressions of Interest process and will be managed and administered by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department. The closing date for receipt of proposals was 21st June 2022.  The Housing Agency is conducting the assessment process and due diligence on the first tranche of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe apartments at the moment but with anticipated construction timelines of around eighteen months Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) supported apartment developments will likely be brought to market from 2024.  Therefore, financial supports from the Fund, which only arise on sale of apartments to eligible purchasers, are not expected to be incurred until 2024, with the subsidy budget expected to be distributed across 2024, 2025 and 2026. </p>  <p>  A small amount of Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) expenditure in scheme development and operational costs and proposal professional review costs will be incurred in 2023.  The remaining funding has been allocated to Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns),</p></reply>

In 2020, 15,885 new HAP tenancies were created, this reduced to 13,095 new HAP tenancies in 2021 and at end Q2 2022, 4,625 new HAP tenancies had been created. </p><p>At end Q2 2022 there were more than 60,000 households actively in receipt of HAP support. The 2023 budget allocation will enable continued support for existing tenancies along with funding for 8,800 new households to be accommodated in HAP supported tenancies.</p><p>HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.  33% of exits from the HAP Scheme have been to other forms of Social Housing.  Including 2,061 transfers to other forms of social housing in the first half of 2022. Last year the transfers to other forms of social housing was 4,587.</p><p>I am committed to decreasing our reliance on the HAP scheme and central to that is significantly scaling up our social housing supply. Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies. My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity in all local authorities.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. </p>  <p>  While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis, with nine administrative regions in place.  A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the services and the funding required to address homelessness in each region. </p>  <p>  Budget 2023 makes provision for &euro;215m in funding for homeless services, an increase from &euro;194 in 2022. The extra funding for Homelessness reflects the priority that this Government is giving to Homelessness. </p>  <p>  The extra funding will allow local authorities to continue to focus on preventing homelessness in the first instance, aid in the further expansion of the Housing First approach in line with commitments made in Housing for All, provide for a planned extension of outreach and intensive engagement services to our most vulnerable and provide accommodation to those experiencing homelessness. Additionally there remains a firm focus on ensuring that pathways out of homelessness for those individuals and families in emergency accommodation are secured as quickly as possible.  </p></reply>

As part of the objective to increase social housing delivery, the plan recognises the significant role that Approved Housing Bodies (&rsquo;s) have played as partners in social housing delivery and will continue to play over the next five years.</p>  <p>  The Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding model has worked very successfully over the past 10 years, particularly for the larger s that have adapted their delivery plans to utilise P&amp;A-CALF funding. Under Housing for All, a specific objective, Action 4.10, is to &ldquo;review the structure and operation of CALF to assess whether any refinements to the facility are required to support delivery of social housing by the  sector across a wider range of Local Authority areas.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  One of the key purposes of this exercise is reviewing the structure of the P&amp;A-CALF funding model to determine if it should be adjusted to support delivery by the  sector across a wider range of areas and what options might be available to enable this.  The deadline set for completion of this work is Q4 2022.</p>  <p>  Due to the rise in construction inflation and increase in interest rates, work on this review was accelerated with the support of the Housing Agency, along with input from the relevant stakeholders and it is currently nearing the final stages of completion.  It is expected to be completed shortly.  </p></reply>

Significant funding has been secured and is being made available to support delivery of Cost Rental by Approved Housing Bodies (s), Local Authorities and by the Land Development Agency (LDA).</p>  <p>  Delivery will increase incrementally, to an average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year. 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026. s will be supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding and Local Authorities will be able to avail of funding for Cost Rental delivery through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF). The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental on its own portfolio of sites, or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.</p>  <p>  International factors have seen an increase in the cost of loan co-financing due to the trajectory of interest rates which impacts  delivery of cost rental homes as well as impacting other housing providers.  Combined with the ongoing impact of construction cost inflation, the viability of schemes has become more challenging, directly affecting the ultimate cost rent paid by tenants.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, Government has decided that it is appropriate to increase the funding ceilings available per dwelling delivered for both the CREL and AHF schemes and my Department is working on operationalising these increases. These increases will be subject to defined criteria and the operational parameters for how these changes will be implemented are currently being finalised and will be completed within the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  These changes will help to address some of the challenges faced by s and Local Authorities in the continued implementation of these Cost Rental schemes, and will help to continue to target rents achievable for Exchequer-supported Cost Rental homes at a minimum discount of 25% below open market rates.</p></reply>

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 allows local authorities to offer less than 100% refund and to vary the level of refund for vacant properties at its annual budget meeting. Since the introduction of the Act, a number of local authorities have taken the decision to reduce the percentage refund of rates available. In agreeing budgets for 2022, 19 local authorities made the decision to offer less than 100% refund to vacant properties, ensuring in those local authorities that some rates are paid on vacant commercial properties, helping discourage prolonged vacancy.</p><p>The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 modernised the legislation governing commercial rates<b></b>and contains provision for schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties<b>.  </b>Section 9 of the Act provides that the Minister may specify the maximum vacancy relief to be applied and that schemes can be made to provide abatement to a specific class or classes of vacant property. The main objective of section 9 of the Act is to discourage commercial vacancy and incentivise occupancy. This marries with the main objectives in &ldquo;Town Centres First&rdquo;, &quot;Housing for All&quot; and &quot;Our Rural Future&quot;.</p><p>Amendments are required to address key issues in the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019. The remaining provisions of the Act, including section 9, cannot be commenced until these issues are addressed. Plans to achieve necessary amendments, commence the legislation and introduce associated regulations were delayed due to the COVID crisis but it is intended to advance this work this year.</p><p>Addressing vacancy and dereliction, and maximising the use of the existing housing stock, is a priority objective of the Government, as evidenced by Housing for All where one of the four pathways in the plan is specifically dedicated to this area.</p><p>My Department continues to liaise with local authorities on the implementation of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 (the Act) with a view to improving its effectiveness. In this regard, my Department initiated a review of the Act in November 2021 and has sought initial submissions from local authorities on potential improvements to the legislative provisions and the way they are applied.

At the end of Q2 2022, over 104,700 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were over 60,700 households actively in receipt of HAP support.</p>  <p>  A key principle of the HAP scheme is that eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, which best suits their needs, in their area of choice. The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation, is solely a matter for the local authority concerned. Data on the number of HAP applications refused due to the non-compliance of landlords with the planning regulations is not collected by my Department.</p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme.</p>  <p>  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP SSC.  If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord may be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority. The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.</p></reply>

At the end of Q2 2022, over 104,700 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were over 60,700 households actively in receipt of HAP support, including 2,155 active tenancies Kildare. </p><p>Local authorities have had discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. On 11 July 2022 I introduced an increase in the HAP discretion rate to 35% and for new tenancies, expanded the couple&rsquo;s rate to single person households. </p><p>It is a matter for each local authority to determine whether the application of a discretionary increase is warranted, and the level of such an increase, on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>The table below provides a breakdown of the total number of active HAP tenancies at the end of each quarter from January 2021 to end Q2 2022, including the number of households in receipt of discretion and the average discretionary increase paid, for each of the municipal districts in Kildare.</p><p><b>Kildare discretion by municipal area at end Q1 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Municipal Area   </b></th>       <th><b>Active Tenancies @end Q1 2021 </b></th>       <th><b>No. of tenancies that received discretion   </b></th>       <th><b>Average Discretion Rate   </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Athy </td>       <td>566 </td>       <td>168 </td>       <td>15% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Celbridge -

Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached. </p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, including those relating to the installation of solar panels on the roofs of houses, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational/community/sports buildings. </p>  <p>  The matter of solar development and the potential impact on protected structures has been a primary consideration of my Department throughout the development of the draft regulations.</p>  <p>  Both the Act and the Regulations contain provisions for the protection of, inter alia, protected structures by way of restrictions on exempted development. These provisions apply to the current solar planning exemptions and have not been amended as part of the current review.</p>  <p>  Section 57 of the Act clarifies the position with regard to planning exemptions for protected structures to provide that &ldquo;[&hellip;] the carrying out of works to a protected structure, or a proposed protected structure, shall be exempted development only if those works would not materially affect the character of: (a) the structure, or (b) any element of the structure which contributes to its special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  In addition, article 9 of the Regulations provides that development shall not be exempted development if it would, inter alia, &ldquo;consist of or comprise [&hellip;] the excavation, alteration or demolition&hellip;of places [&hellip;] of archaeological, geological, historical, scientific or ecological interest, the preservation, conservation or protection of which is an objective of a development plan [&hellip;]&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  With regard to what would materially affect the character of a protected structure and any uncertainty as to when planning permission is required, a person may contact the relevant planning authority and seek a declaration under section 5 of the Act that will confirm the position. In addition, a declaration in relation to a protected structure may be sought under section 57 of the Act by the owner or occupier of the structure.</p>  <p>  It will be open to any person to seek planning permission for proposed development affecting a protected structure. Buildings of architectural heritage significance have their role to play in climate change mitigation and there will be cases where the installation of solar panels will be acceptable but this is a matter for the planning authorities to decide on a case-by-case basis, either through the declaration processes or the planning system.</p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case in which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned, except in very specific circumstances, which do not apply in this case. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. In this regard, the process for finalising the solar regulations has commenced and is expected to be completed imminently.</p></reply>

During our time on the Security Council we are pushing to improve the mandates of UN peacekeeping operations. </p>  <p>  We are working to ensure that the mandates for peacekeeping missions align with the needs of the populations that they serve and that peacekeeping missions are adequately resourced to that purpose, including in the case of MINURSO. We believe that UN Peace Missions have an essential role to play in protecting civilians and promoting respect for human rights, and Ireland is supporting their crucial work in this area.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding position on Western Sahara is one of full support for MINURSO, the UN-led process and the Secretary General&rsquo;s efforts to bring about a definitive and mutually acceptable political settlement on this issue. The UN path is, in our view, the only path forward.</p>  <p>  The Council, in UNSCR 2602 of 2021, called on the parties to the conflict to develop and implement independent and credible measures to ensure full respect for human rights and has encouraged enhancing cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), including by facilitating visits of the High Commissioner to the region.</p>  <p>  The Council has called on all parties to respect the terms of the ceasefire agreement of 1991, to fulfil their obligations under international law, including ensuring full respect for human rights, and to refrain from taking any actions that could lead to further destabilisation of the situation on the ground.</p>  <p>  In the mandate renewal process, as in all our work across the Council agenda, Ireland will continue to promote respect for human rights, accountability and compliance with international law.</p></reply>

However, and as referred to by the Deputy, Ireland implements EU sanctions adopted as part of the Union&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (as well as implementing UN sanctions). The introduction of new EU sanctions requires consensus among all EU Member States. There have been no recent EU proposals for sanctions on Azerbaijan, and I have no plans to propose sanctions at EU level. Ireland's position--and that of the EU--is that dialogue and engagement, rather than sanctions, remain the most effective tools at hand to resolve this conflict. </p><p>  Ireland continues to support the international format of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group to achieve a negotiated, comprehensive and sustainable settlement of the conflict, particularly on the long-term status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Ireland also welcomes the continued efforts of President of the European Council, Charles Michel, to broker talks between President Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Pashinyan of Armenia. In my capacity as Chair of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee of Ministers, on 13 September, I called on Azerbaijan and Armenia to pull back from any further steps which might worsen the situation, to respect international agreements, and to engage in peace talks without further delay. I also called upon member states of the Council of Europe to abide by their commitments taken upon accession, including to settle conflicts by peaceful means, and I offered the Council&rsquo;s support towards efforts to make peace.</p></reply>

Ireland and the EU have reiterated calls on Russia to fully comply with its obligations under international law, and have condemned in the strongest possible terms violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including the ongoing detention, abduction and kidnapping of people by the Russian Armed Forces and their proxies.</p>  <p>   Ireland has consistently called on Russia to end its aggression, to comply with its obligations under international law, and withdraw all forces unconditionally from the sovereign territory of Ukraine. Following President Putin&rsquo;s announcement of a partial mobilisation, which aims to send further Russian military personnel to Ukraine, we have continued to work at the UN General Assembly, UN Security Council, Human Rights Council other international fora, not only to bring an end to this war but also to support all measures to ensure accountability for violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. </p>  <p>  I am not familiar with the specific case referenced. However, Ireland regularly raises concerns at Russia&rsquo;s actions targeting both its own citizens and those of other countries, both bilaterally and in relevant EU and international fora, including at the UN Security Council, the UN Human Rights Council and in the Council of Europe context. Such human rights violations by Russia are also regularly raised by the EU in its interactions with the Russian authorities.</p></reply>

This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence. </p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. A five year Equipment Development Plan for continued re-equipment was developed on a civil military basis and was published in June 2020.  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging priorities, operational requirements and changes in technology. This is an ongoing iterative process.</p>  <p>  There are a number of defensive equipment acquisition and upgrade projects for which there will be capital expenditure in the coming years. These include the midlife upgrade of the Army's fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III Armoured Personnel Carrier vehicles which is well underway as well as the completion of the delivery of an additional 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles. In addition, the Army's non-armoured fleet continues to be updated with over 220 vehicles due for delivery in 2022.    </p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, the programme for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft is well underway with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Alongside the recently acquired PC-12 aircraft some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing and the programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course. Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara and it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works. </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the national development plan of &euro;566 million over the 2022 to 2025 timeframe. The Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million, with an increased allocation of &euro;176 million for 2023. This is following Government approval for a move over a six-year period to a level of Defence Forces&rsquo; capability equivalent to &lsquo;Level of Ambition 2&rsquo; (LOA2), as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission on Defence Forces, which will entail funding increases to reach a Defence budget of approximately &euro;1.5 billion (at January 2022 prices) by 2028 through the annual Estimates. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and the Report of the Commission, while building on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p></reply>

At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>   Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the pupils referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for school transport under the terms of the scheme.  These pupils referred were unsuccessful in obtaining concessionary seats for the 2022/23 school year as the existing school transport service is currently operating to capacity and there are no seats available.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  </p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.  However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS progamme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis.</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  Following the processing of the appeal received from the school regrettably there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS identification model to the school. My Department, however, will continue to support the school and the school community as they deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to their students and young learners. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>Upcoming policy advice from the NCSE on the specialist education provision being provided will become available shortly.  In its progress report (2019), the Council advised that there is no conclusive evidence at present that any one type of special education place was better than another.  The advice will also address the State&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.</p><p>Special classes are established to meet the needs of students with very complex needs arising from certain disabilities, and whose assessed educational needs are supported by professional reports, cannot be met in a mainstream setting. </p><p>The NCSE advise that over 98% of children with special educational needs are enrolled in mainstream settings and are supported, where appropriate, by special education teachers (SET) and special needs assistants (SNA). </p><p>Through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), the NCSE opens special classes in accordance with a range of identified Special Education needs. SENOs consult with other education entities (e.g. NEPS and the Inspectorate) when establishing any special class, and consider both the present and the future potential needs within a given area. The NCSE must be satisfied that the class is sustainable and appropriately located. </p><p>The NCSE is aware that sometimes, parents of children with special educational needs, including those presenting with conditions similar to ASD, can experience difficulties in accessing school places for their children because of their child&rsquo;s special educational needs. Where there are children who would benefit from similar supports provided to those with ASD, the student&rsquo;s parent should make contact with the local SENO so that their child&rsquo;s needs can be taken into account. SENO contact details can be found at: ncse.ie/seno-support-service</p><p>School management are responsible for the deployment and review of SNA support to ensure those with the greatest level of need are supported, in accordance with the Department Circular 0035/2022. The NCSE recognise that the needs of students may change over time. Should the school perceive that an additional SNA allocation is required to support the care needs of their students, the school can apply to the NCSE for an exceptional review of their allocation through the NCSE School Support portal. An exceptional review of the SNA allocation may result in an increase, decrease, or for the allocation to be maintained at the current level. If a school are dissatisfied with the results of a review, an appeal process is available to them.</p><p>The NCSE offer further support and advice through a suite of Teacher Professional Learning seminars, as well as on-site training to build teacher capacity through our network of Advisors. Guidelines for schools, including information on how special classes are resourced are available on the NCSE website through: ncse.ie/special-class-guidelines</p><p>As of August 2022, there are 133 general learning disability special classes nationwide. These are separated into mild general learning disability special classes, moderate general learning disability special classes, and severe/profound general learning disability special classes. A breakdown of these special classes per county is provided in the below table.</p><p>I can reassure the Deputy that the local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: ncse.ie/regional-servic</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie.</p><p><b>General Learning Disability Special Classes</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>Mild General Learning Disability</th>       <th>Moderate General Learning Disability</th>       <th>Severe/Profound General Learning Disability</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>17 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td>10 </td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>N/A </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total  </td>       <td>51  </td>       <td>73  </td>       <td>9  </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.</p><p>For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2023. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation on the DEIS programme to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. </p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis.</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  Following the processing of the appeal received regrettably there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS identification model to the school. My Department, however, will continue to support the school and the school community as they deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to their students and young learners. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p><p>In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p><p>Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. </p><p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p><p>In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. </p><p>Temporary Alleviation Measures are measures pending completion of the review of the School Transport Scheme, that was initially introduced at post-primary level in 2019 and will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29<sup>th</sup>April and registered for a ticket by the 29<sup>th</sup>July. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the post-primary children referred to by the Deputy are all attending their third, fourth or fifth school and therefore do not meet the criteria of the Temporary Alleviation Measures mentioned above. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann have also advised that the primary school children referred to by the Deputy reside 1.7 km from home to their nearest school and school of attendance.  These children are not eligible for school transport as they do not meet the distance criteria as set out in the primary school transport scheme. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann also advise that the existing school transport services are currently operating to capacity and there are no seats available and that the children referred were unsuccessful in obtaining concessionary seats for the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  </p><p>The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

In the context of these circulars teaching service is service given in a recognised school by a qualified primary teacher or a qualified post-primary teacher.  Also in the context of these circulars relevant non-teaching service is service except for teaching service.</p>  <p>  If a teacher has been teaching in an international setting prior to qualifying as a teacher and is seeking recognition of that international service, they must comply with the terms of the relevant incremental credit circular relating to either primary or post-primary teachers. Teaching service can only be reckoned when the teacher is a recognised qualified teacher here in Ireland and has worked in a recognised school setting.</p>  <p>  Similarly, relevant non-teaching service is defined as service other than teaching service. When a teacher is refused incremental credit because they were not a qualified teacher, it does not automatically mean that they can have that service reckoned under the relevant non-teaching category.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p><p>As you are aware, in July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures.  </p><p>School Transport ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p><p>There has been an increase in tickets allocated across all counties, with an increase of 18% in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils compared to start of the 2021/2022 school year and an increase of 27% in the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils compared to the start of the 2021/2022 school year.</p><p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply.</p><p>Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school.</p><p>At post-primary level students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post-primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p><p>All children who are eligible and who completed the application and registration process on time will be accommodated in the 2022 school year.  In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th July. </p><p>Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary, applicants and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat on when all eligible children have been catered for.</p><p>While numbers are still being finalised for the 2022/23 school year as Bus &Eacute;ireann continue to process applications, a small number of on time applications are still in the process of being assessed. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service. Regrettably, however, the unprecedented numbers of new applications and some constraints in supply of vehicles and drivers has led to some delays in issuing tickets.</p><p>As Bus &Eacute;ireann process remaining applications and where additional services may need to be put in place for eligible children, any capacity on these services will be offered to concessionary applicants.</p><p>Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  </p><p>The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.</p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.</p><p>For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2023. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

It also includes funding for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for an additional 54 psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes. </p><p>In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 special needs assistants in our schools next year. </p><p>For the first time ever we will have over 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and over 20,000 Special needs assistants. Together we have almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>In 2023, there will be a significant investment in the expansion of the National Council for Special Education, with a total full-year investment of &euro;13 million, in over 160 additional staff. This investment is being undertaken so that the NSCE can respond effectively, compassionately and quickly to the increased need in our education system so that children and their families are fully supported and achieve the best possible education outcomes.</p><p>My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this approach is delivering.  We have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.</p><p>For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023.</p><p>As of 21<sup>st</sup>September 2022, there are 50 special classes in Waterford for the 2022/23 school year.  The 50 special classes in Waterford is broken down by 33 at primary level and 17 at post primary level.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie </p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023/2023. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

This settlement resolves this long-standing issue through the payment of a once off ex-gratia payment rather than a pension to eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  On the 23rd December 2021, both unions involved confirmed acceptance of this settlement which will benefit approximately 2,500 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008. It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million. </p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age are now able to apply for this payment.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of months, an administrative and ICT system to accept applications and process payments was put in place within the Department of Social Protection. The first group of ex-gratia applications have been received - these relate to persons who retired since 2008.   Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Expenditure and Reform as regards the timing of issuing of these payments.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

Under the Yearly Average approach, anomalies can arise because of the date of entry into insurable  employment. A late date of entry into insurable employment can result in an unusually low divisor, and  consequently a higher yearly average than would be representative of the number of contributions</p>  <p>  To this end, the National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system, be replaced with a &lsquo;Total Contributions Approach&rsquo; (TCA), which would make the level of pension directly proportionate to the number of social insurance contributions made by a person over his or her working life, with significant pension credits granted to people who have taken time out of the workplace to perform caring duties.</p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Government announced an Interim TCA to calculate the entitlement of pensioners who reached state pension age on or after 1 September 2012 (i.e. those born on or after 1 September 1946) and who had a reduced rate pension entitlement based on post Budget 2012 rate bands. All pensioners who have reached state pension age since September 2012, therefore, have seen both Yearly Average and interim TCA methods applied and they receive whichever rate is most beneficial.</p>  <p>  In September, I announced the Government's intention for a phased 10-year transition to the TCA method and the abolition of the Yearly Average approach for calculating individual State Pension (Contributory) entitlement, to commence from January 2024.  </p>  <p>  The current model of Interim TCA method (also known as the Aggregated Contribution Method) will become the definitive TCA model, i.e., 40 years, or 2,080 contributions, required to qualify for a maximum State Pension (Contributory) payment rate.  The TCA model includes provision for 10 years of PRSI Credits and 20 years of HomeCaring periods, but with a cap of 20 years combined PRSI Credits and HomeCaring periods.  This facilitates a more equitable approach as pension outcomes are in line with the total number of contributions paid and credited, with significant provision for years  of caring in the home.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary. </p>  <p>  The scheme is demand led.  Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  There have been 85,322 applications for additional needs payments (excluding supplements) received by the Department to date in 2022 (end of August).  Of those registered claims, 56,950 have been awarded.  This does not reflect the number of claims that have been disallowed, withdrawn, cancelled or are awaiting further information.  These figures represent a snapshot of claim activity and are subject to change. </p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers, ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  The current processing data available indicates that 50% of applications for Additional Needs Payments are finalised within 0-4 weeks and that 90% are finalised within 0-8 weeks.  In cases where it is evident that a customer is experiencing particular hardship and where their application is complete and accompanied by the required documentation, their application will be prioritised for decision.</p>  <p>   Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.

The Department is charged with identifying where a person has an income support need and providing that income support, for example in the form of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, a disability allowance, or a carer's allowance. </p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant. Spending in 2022 is expected to amount to over &euro;1.5 billion. </p>  <p>  The two principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided, and that the means test which applies is satisfied. Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is primarily aimed at carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that eligibility for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is not contingent on a particular disability or illness or the severity of disability or incapacity of the person being cared for.</p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally. This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring. The application of a means-test not only ensures that the recipient has an income need but also that scarce resources are targeted to those with the greatest need.  </p>  <p>  Last year I made significant changes to the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance with the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance increasing to &euro;350 per week for single carers, and to &euro;750 per week for a couple. I also an increased the capital disregard for carers from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. The changes took effect in June and mean that many Carers on a reduced rate moved to a higher payment. In addition, Carers who up to now did not qualify for a payment due to means will be brought into the Carers Allowance system for the first time.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide the estimated annual cost of providing a non means tested full rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. While the Department can establish how many people are in receipt of a reduced payment and where Domiciliary Care Allowance is in payment, the Department of Social Protection has no administrative data on the level capacity/incapacity of the child. </p>  <p>  There are other income supports available for carers provided by the Department of Social Protection that are not means-tested; these include:</p>  <p>  - The Carers Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care. It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). </p>  <p>  - Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is not means tested. As part of Budget 2023, I increased the Domiciliary Care Allowance rate by &euro;20.50 to &euro;330 per month with effect from January 2023.  There is no restriction on the number of children in respect of whom Domiciliary Care Allowance may be claimed. In other words, a person caring for more than one child who qualifies for Domiciliary Care Allowance may claim the monthly allowance for each child. </p>  <p>  - The annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all carers providing full-time care to a person with a disability or an older person, regardless of the carer&rsquo;s means or social insurance contributions. The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate  to their needs. The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. As part of Budget Measures 2021, I increased the rate of the grant by &euro;150.  The current rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021. The Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's Allowance (full and reduced rates), Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year. </p>  <p>  Last week, as part of Budget 2023, I announced a further range of measures for carers including:</p>  <p>  - A Cost of Living Double Payment to carers in October,</p>  <p>  - A &euro;500 Cost of Living payment for people receiving Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant which will be paid in November,</p>  <p>  - Carers will also receive the Christmas Bonus Double Payment in early December,</p>  <p>  - A &euro;12 increase in the maximum rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit with effect from January 2023 with proportionate increases for people receiving a reduced rate,</p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 increase for each Qualified Child bringing rates to &euro;50 for Over 12s and &euro;42 for Under 12s from January 2023, and</p>  <p>  - The Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be disregarded in the means assessment for Fuel Allowance with effect from January 2023.</p>  <p>  In addition, I also announced that, in respect of the Domiciliary Care Allowance, along with the rate increase above that this allowance will be available in respect of children with severe illness or disability who remain in hospital for up to six months after birth.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers by this Department under review and will ensure that consultations with carers' representative groups continue so that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met. However, any further changes to the current supports provided by this Department would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The projects selected included all 27 organisations who received funding under the former three-year Ability Programme which concluded at the end of August 2021.</p>  <p>  Last year, I committed that a new employment programme for people with disabilities would be included in the new Operational Programme for Ireland under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021-2027.  This new disability focused employment measure will build on the learnings of the former Ability Programme. The new programme will also need to add complementarity to the suite of existing employment supports targeted at people with disabilities provided by my department and broader national strategies for employment of people with disabilities, including the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  The ESF Managing Authority in Ireland - based in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - has compiled the Operational Programme for Ireland. The Operational Programme includes a new disability-focused employment measure and has been formally submitted by Government to the European Commission.  It is expected that Commission approval will be communicated over the coming months. </p>  <p>  Once approval is in place, it is anticipated that the new disability programme will be open by way of a competitive process to applications from organisations across the country, including the 45 organisations currently being funded under the Dormant Accounts Measure outlined above.  It is expected that this new ESF+ programme will open to applications in 2023. </p>  <p>  Planning in relation to the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2023 began in May of this year. The draft Action Plan will be submitted to Government for approval shortly, by my colleague Joe O' Brien TD Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, and it is expected that it will be published towards the end of October. </p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that the concern he raises is acknowledged and noted.  My commitment to providing funding supports to improve the employment possibilities of people with disabilities has not been found wanting to date.</p>  <p>I trust that this clarifies the issue for the Deputy at this time.  </p></reply>

Over 1.4 million people will benefit, including pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and jobseekers.

This extensive packages includes measures in relation to the Working Family Payment. </p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment (WFP) is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings. The WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents, and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. There are approximately 47,000 families with 103,000 children who are currently in receipt of the WFP. The estimated spend on the WFP in 2022 is &euro;349 million.</p>  <p>  The Budget package includes a range of measures that will assist people with the cost of living in one-off payments this Autumn. This includes a once-off payment of &euro;500 to recipients of the Working Family Payment. A payment of &euro;500 will be made to families in receipt of WFP on the payment date regardless of the level of their WFP payment. This payment will be made in November at an estimated cost of &euro;23 million.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have also provided for a &euro;40 per week increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds for all family sizes. This is the highest ever increase in the Working Family Payment thresholds. This will ensure that families on low incomes will receive more weekly income from the scheme - up to &euro;24 euro per week. It will also ensure that the increase of 80 cent per hour in the National Minimum Wage does not negatively impact on people's income from the WFP. It also means that more people will qualify for the payment. This measure will take effect from January at a cost of approximately &euro;16.8 million in 2023.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Tusla provides a continuum of services including early intervention and family support services, child protection and welfare services and alternative care services to identify and respond to the needs of the children and families who are referred. </p>  <p>  Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website. Reports can also be made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS). Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or Tusla but usually both agencies work together in such cases.</p>  <p>  Where immediate or potential danger is identified to a child from a parent or guardian, this referral is treated with the highest priority and response by Tusla. In the first instance Tusla will ensure, under its Signs of Safety national practice guidance, that the child is safe and that an immediate safety network is identified to support the child and parents. Simultaneously, Tusla will endeavour to work in partnership with the parent(s) or guardian(s) to assess the cause of the difficulties and provide, or refer to, the necessary services. A safety network for the child will be identified and implemented under the Signs of Safety national practice model to ensure the immediate safety of the child or children within the family. Where it is assessed, following completion of an intake and initial assessment process, that significant child protection concerns exist and potential risk of harm to the child by the parents is identified, a child protection case conference is convened. At such a conference a decision may be made to place the child on the child protection notification system (CPNS). Where this threshold of risk is not met (that is, a child protection case conference is not required or the child is not placed on the CPNS), a Tusla led safety plan will be implemented for the child. </p>  <p>  If the outcome of the initial screening and visit to the child and family as part of the initial social work preliminary enquiry is that a child cannot stay in the care of their parent or guardian due to immediate risk of significant harm to the child&rsquo;s safety or life, consideration will be given to whether there are appropriate extended family members to provide immediate care for the child and also whether consideration of admission to foster or residential care, age appropriate to the child&rsquo;s care needs, is necessary to ensure the child&rsquo;s /young person&rsquo;s safety. An admission to care will occur either with the voluntary consent of the parent(s) or guardian(s) or by Tusla making an application to the district court for an emergency care order or interim care order application.</p>  <p>  In some circumstances where child protection concerns exist in relation to new born infants Tusla, following a detailed assessment by the social work teams, may consider as appropriate to the child&rsquo;s safety and the parent&rsquo;s needs, whether a residential parenting assessment unit for mother and baby is required. This would potentially be a matter for Court oversight and representation by legal teams. The appointment of a Guardian ad litem would also be considered by the Court in these circumstances.</p>  <p>  Where necessary Tusla seeks to engage relevant services and professionals to provide appropriate supports for parents. Acute crises for parents that necessitate interventions by mental health or addiction services would be a matter for the HSE in close liaison with Tusla teams in respect of care arrangements of the children concerned.</p>  <p>  Tusla is also tasked with providing family support services in accordance with Section 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, which are provided directly and by commissioning family support services through its community and voluntary sector partners.</p>  <p>  Family support services are focused on early intervention with the aim of promoting and protecting the health, well-being and rights of children, young people and their families. At the same time, particular attention is given to those who are vulnerable or at risk. </p>  <p>  The number of family and community supports are wide and varied.  Tusla is engaged in the following family and community supports: </p>  <p>  - Family Resource Centres</p>  <p>  - Family therapeutic services</p>  <p>  - Prevention Partnership Family Support</p>  <p>  - Parenting Information/ Parenting 24/7</p>  <p>  - Child and Youth Participation </p>  <p>  - Meitheal</p>  <p>  - Psychological Services</p>  <p>  - Early Years (pre-school)</p>  <p>  - School Age Services</p>  <p>  - Alternative Education and Registration Services</p>  <p>  These services include those delivered directly by Tusla, including those provided under the Prevention, Partnership, and Family Support (PPFS) service, and those which are funded or co-funded by Tusla. Tusla also directly supports family support services through structures such as Family Resource Centres (FRCs) and the Area Based Childhood Programme. </p>  <p>  Tusla has also established Child and Family Support Networks (CFSNs), which are collaborative networks of community, voluntary and statutory providers. CFSNs seek to improve access to support services for children and their families.  Each network consists of services that play a role in the lives of children and families in that area. Local CFSNs co-ordinators can be contacted to provide further details on the services available in a local area.</p></reply>

Since 1999,  Ireland has undertaken investigations into allegations of abuse in several institutional settings. These investigations have sought to establish the facts relating to the operation of the institutions, as well as the manner in which those who were resident in them were treated. </p><p>In establishing the independent statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes in February 2015, the then Government sought to ensure an independent and thorough investigation of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions during the period 1922 to 1998. Notably, the Commission was specifically tasked with investigating concerns related to systematic discrimination within these institutions.</p><p>Following publication of the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, An Taoiseach offered a formal apology on behalf of the Government, the State and its citizens to all those who spent time in these institutions. In this apology, An Taoiseach acknowledged the failings of the State, over many decades, to protect vulnerable citizens, and to uphold their fundamental rights. The State apology recognised the <i>&ldquo;additional impact which a lack of knowledge and understanding had on the treatment and outcomes of mothers and children with different racial and cultural heritage, those who faced mental health challenges, or those with physical and intellectual disabilities&rdquo;.</i></p><p>It was further acknowledged that<i>&ldquo;such discriminatory attitudes exacerbated the shame and stigma felt by some of our most vulnerable citizens, especially where opportunities for non-institutional placement of children were restricted by an unjust belief that they were unsuitable for placement with families&rdquo;.</i></p><p>This State apology marked a starting point for further measures designed to address the needs and concerns of survivors and their families. </p><p>I am acutely aware that there is no financial payment which could make up for the immense pain and suffering endured by so many of our citizens whose lives have been affected by these issues.</p><p>The Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme is just one aspect of the overall redress package of supports and measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Homes Institutions which seeks to provide an inclusive and enduring response to the priority needs of all survivors. </p><p>The proposed structure of the Scheme, with increasing financial payments depending on length of stay, recognises that higher payments should be made to those who were subjected to institutional conditions for a prolonged period.</p><p>This allows for a simple and non-adversarial application process, in which applicants will not have to prove abuse and the State can shoulder much of the administrative burden.  </p><p>My Department and other state authorities are working to ensure survivors see tangible results as early as possible.</p></reply>

Reporting is beginning this year. </p>  <p>  - Significant advances have been made in the provision of family leaves, including the extension of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit to seven weeks for each parent and extending the entitlement to Adoptive Leave to fathers through the Family Leaves and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021. </p>  <p>  - I will also shortly introduce to the Houses of the Oireachtas the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill to transpose the remaining aspects of the EU Work Life Balance Directive including the right of workers to Carers' Leave of five working days per year, and providing workers who are parents of children up to 12 years old, and carers under the Directive, with a right to request flexible working arrangements. The Bill will also extend the current entitlement to breastfeeding breaks from six months to two years.</p>  <p>  - Provisions for the introduction of Domestic Violence Leave to enable persons experiencing domestic violence to have time off work, including to attend court to secure orders against the person perpetrating such violence are been developed and will be introduced as part of the Bill at Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  - Other ongoing work includes the establishment of an Interdepartmental Network in 2021, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to implement gender and equality budgeting. The group will facilitate the embedding of the Equality Budgeting Initiative across all Government departments, and guide its continued progress. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment that the Government will develop and implement a new National Strategy for Women and Girls. </p>  <p>  I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over the term of the strategy and consider how we can develop a new strategy which is even more robust and effective.</p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department has commissioned a study to evaluate the processes for implementation of three equality strategies, which includes the National Strategy for Women and Girls as well as the Migrant Integration Strategy and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.

It also provides for the identification of remains and their return to family members, where possible. </p>  <p>  The legislation was developed in response to the abhorrent situation at the site of the former Mother and Baby institution in Tuam, Co. Galway, where it was confirmed that children&rsquo;s remains had been discovered that were interred in a manifestly inappropriate manner and the Government was advised that a full forensic-standard excavation, recovery and identification of those remains could not take place under current legislation. To avoid delays in responding to any similar situations that may arise in the future, the Act is not site specific and also allows for excavations and identification programmes at other institutional sites should manifestly inappropriate burials be discovered.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Act provides for significant consultation in relation to an intervention. Most notably, the Act requires the appointment of an Advisory Board to guide and support the Director of an intervention in his or her role. The Board, which is to be chaired by a former coroner or someone with coronial expertise, will have members with a range of expertise and backgrounds, including scientific experts, former residents and/or family members of the deceased. A Director is required to consult with the Board at regular intervals, including at key decisions points in an intervention. Other consultation and engagement mechanisms include a requirement that a Director make final arrangements for recovered remains in line with the wishes of family members as well as a requirement that a Director provide regular updates on an intervention to family members, stakeholders and the public.</p>  <p>  The Act provides that, following the establishment of an Office of Director, a relevant Minister appoint a Director to manage and oversee an intervention. My officials are currently liaising with the Public Appointments Service in relation to the recruitment process for a Director of Authorised Intervention, Tuam. The criteria and other relevant material relating to the recruitment and appointment of the Director will be published as part of the recruitment process. Preparations are also underway in my Department for the appointment of an Advisory Board and the details of the appointment process will be available in due course.</p>  <p>  Tendering for the specific expertise required to undertake an intervention is a matter for a Director appointed to manage and oversee the process. In this regard the Act requires that a Director ensures that excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis of remains is undertaken by appropriately qualified persons at a forensic standard and in accordance with international best practice and professional rules and guidelines. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Vienna Protocol was prepared to provide guidance in relation to the treatment of remains of people of Jewish origin. The Institutional Burials Act was not designed to contain specific provisions regarding different religious or ethnic groups. However, it does provide for a Director to have regard to any known religious practices of the deceased when making final arrangements for remains where there are no family members or stated wishes. </p></reply>

The overall objective of the National Action Plan for Childminding is to improve access to high quality and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare through childminding.</p><p>To do this, the Action Plan sets out an incremental and supportive pathway to regulation. This will enable more childminders to access Government subsidies, making their services more affordable to parents. It will also enable them to access a variety of supports to assist them in meeting regulatory and quality requirements. In achieving this overall objective, the Action Plan will contribute to the aims of supporting parental choice, and increasing access to affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare places. It will help support labour market participation for parents, and offer more flexibility for parents who work irregular hours. It will help improve the quality of provision, supporting child outcomes, and provide greater recognition and support for childminders.</p><p>A programme of actions is already under way during Phase 1 of the National Action Plan for Childminding to support childminders to come into the scope of regulation and supports. Actions under way include the development of new, childminder-specific regulations that are proportionate and appropriate to the home environment in which childminders work, as well as the development of new, bespoke training for childminders.</p><p>The National Action Plan for Childminding commits to opening the National Childcare Scheme to childminders at the earliest possible opportunity, though it will be necessary first to develop and introduce childminder-specific regulations, and to give childminders adequate time and support to meet regulatory requirements.</p><p>In scope, the Action Plan mainly addresses self-employed childminders who work in their own home. The Action Plan is not primarily concerned with nannies or au pairs, who are employees of a child&rsquo;s parents / guardians. The Action Plan does, however, include an action to develop information and training resources in relation to the use of nannies and au pairs.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 50,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 39,000 of those have been referred to this Department seeking accommodation from the State.</p><p>Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted. </p><p>The priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation.</p><p>The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response. The scale of response to this crisis has been unprecedented and Irish people have displayed an incredible level of generosity in their support and pledges of accommodation.</p><p>My officials advise me that an onsite review of the centre detailed by the Deputy was carried out on 28 June 2022 in order to investigate some concerns which had been raised.</p><p>I cam further advised that there are<b></b>154 residents currently accommodated at the centre detailed by the Deputy. Of these, 105 are accommodated on a long-term basis and 49 are accommodated on a short-term emergency basis.</p><p>The 105 longer-term residents are accommodated in 78 bedrooms, each room with an ensuite bathroom with toilet, shower and wash hand basin.</p><p>Occupancy in those rooms is as follows:</p><p>Rooms with 1 resident  50(50 residents)</p><p>Rooms with 2 residents 19(28 residents)</p><p>Rooms with 3 residents9(27 residents)</p><p>In rooms with two or more residents, there are either family or friends who arrived together. In rooms with three residents, they are family units. No person under 18 is permitted to sleep in a room without their parent or legal guardian. </p><p>In addition to the above, a wing of this centre is used for temporary emergency accommodation with a capacity of 50 and a current occupancy of 49. The configuration of this section is in a dormitory set up and it is not intended for longer stays.</p><p>A shower block unit adjacent to the building is for the exclusive use of the up to 50 residents availing of this temporary accommodation.  It contains five private showers and changing areas. There is also access within the building specifically for residents of this wing to the following number of toilets, sinks and urinals:</p><p>Toilets22</p><p>Sinks22</p><p>Urinals5</p><p>Showers5 (as per the unit mentioned above)</p><p>I can advise the Deputy as follows regarding medical services. The centre&rsquo;s Facilities Management service, which is contracted by my Department, notifies the relevant state bodies about our residents and their requirements and facilitates bodies such as the HSE to access the residents and to have them assessed and treated as is required. In the process, the Facilities Management Service assists with the following:</p><p>1. Obtaining medical cards &amp;amp; medical card applications for newer residents;</p><p>2. Assignment to a GP;</p><p>3. Notifying the HSE as to the residents and facilitating their frequent visits on site.</p><p>The HSE is notified in the event that a resident is in crisis or unwell. </p><p>All of the 105 long-term residents have obtained medical cards and that all newer or temporary residents have completed their applications for medical cards.</p><p>With regard to education requirements of residents, the Facilities Management service engages with the Department of Education. In addition, the following facilities are on site to assist the residents:</p><p>1. English classes six days per week which are supported by the CDETB. These classes cater for all levels of English. </p><p>2. The centre management assist in the registering of children in schools.</p><p>3. The centre management facilitate the CDETB Youth Liaison officer in entering young adults into suitable courses.</p><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that there is a catering service on site provided by a professional catering company. The catering company provides three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) and there are ad hoc snacks and teas and coffees available throughout the day. There is no restriction on &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; and school lunch options are also in place.</p><p>I trust this information is of assistance.</p></reply>

In December 2021, Government adopted the 25 recommendations contained in an Expert Group report, <i>Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC).</i>On 15 September, I launched Together for Better, the new funding model for early learning and childcare. This new funding model will support delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.</p><p>Together for Better brings together three major elements, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model, the National Childcare Scheme and Core Funding, in line with the Employment Regulation Orders coming into effect.</p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream worth &euro;266 million in 2023 to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.  </p><p>As a condition of receiving Core Funding, a Partner Service agrees not to increase the fee for any Service Type which was extant on September 30 2021 or introduce an extra charge for any component of that Service Type.  The fees policy for each service is outlined in the Parent Statement, a copy of which must be shared with parents within a month of Core Funding beginning or the parent joining the service, whichever is the later. This gives parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time.</p><p>To date, over 90% of eligible services have become Partner Services under Core Funding, committing to working in partnership with the State for the public good, and to a freeze on parental fees. A list of Partner Services is available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/together-for-better/ </p><p>Budget 2023 introduced further enhancements to the NCS. From January 2023, any family who is not already at the maximum hourly subsidy will see an increase in their subsidy. All families who would currently receive the minimum (universal) subsidy of 50c per hour will receive &euro;1.40. </p><p>For those who receive a subsidy under the income assessed subsidy, the amount of the increase will taper down as they approach the maximum hourly subsidy rate. The reason for this is that the aim is to reduce co-payments by an average of 25 per cent; those currently in receipt of the highest subsidies pay the lowest co-payments.</p><p>The amount of increase individual families will see in their per hour subsidy, will differ widely depending on their current subsidy.</p><p>As the State does not employ early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector.  However, there has recently been an important and historic development with the setting of new minimum hourly rates for various roles in the Early Years Services sector.</p><p>On 15 September 2022, the first ever Employment Regulation Orders for the Early Years Services sector came into effect, setting new minimum hourly rates of pay for various roles in the Early Years Services Sector as follows:</p><p>- &euro;13.00 for Early Years Educators/ School-Age Childcare practitioners;</p><p>- &euro;14.00 for Early Years Lead Educators / School-Age Childcare co-ordinators;</p><p>- &euro;15.50 for Graduate Early Years Lead Educators / School-Age Childcare co-ordinators</p><p>- &euro;15.70 for Deputy Managers;</p><p>- &euro;16.50 for Managers; and </p><p>- &euro;17.25 for Graduate Managers.</p><p>The Orders are being supported by Government&rsquo;s Core Funding scheme which commenced on the 15<sup>th</sup>September, and will see increases in funding to early learning and childcare services to support improvements in staff wages, alongside a commitment to freeze parental fees. It is estimated that 73% of those working in the sector will see their wages rise as a result of the Employment Regulation Orders with the wages of 50% of employees in the sector expected to rise by 10% or more, and the wages of 20% of employees are expected to rise by 20% or more.</p><p>I am also committed to addressing other challenges which may impact on the recruitment and retention of staff in the sector. In December 2021, I published &quot;Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC), 2022-2028&quot;. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. One of its five &quot;pillars&quot; comprises commitments aimed at supporting recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce, and it includes actions to raise the profile of careers in the sector.</p></reply>

Due to the unprecedented demand, and in order to meet the immediate and short term accommodation needs of this large increase in arrivals, varied accommodation options have been utilised throughout the country to help to house applicants on an emergency basis and to prevent homelessness. </p><p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth published a Request for Tender in January 2022 for the provision of accommodation services and related services for international protection applicants to increase the Department&rsquo;s capacity. The tender has an inbuilt flexibility to allow for re-advertisement to help address increased demand.

It must be noted that early learning and childcare providers are private businesses. As such, it is a matter for each provider to decide whether they enter into any contractual arrangement with the Department, including for the NCS.

I am conscious of the extremely positive impact these organisations have on improving outcomes for children, young people and families all over Ireland. </p><p>I understand that where the Deputy refers to Section 38 and Section 39, he is referring to the Health Act 2004, which is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) agreement reached between the Department of Health and HSE and trade unions representing staff in certain section 38 &amp;amp; 39 organisations is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p><p>The Child and Family Agency Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Tusla, which included the transfer of certain functions of the Health Service Executive to the new Agency. The Act was signed into law on the 15th December 2013 following substantial consultation and legislative scrutiny.</p><p>Community and voluntary organisations who provide valuable services to help Ireland's children and families had, prior to the establishment of Tusla, been receiving funding from the HSE. Since establishment of Tusla in 2014, many of those organisations began to receive their funding from Tusla. The arrangements that Tusla enters into with a person or organisation for the provision of child and family services have been subject to the provisions of Part 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013. In accordance with Section 56 of that Act, Tusla commissions service providers in over 600 community and voluntary sector bodies to deliver services on its behalf. Such relationships are then governed under a service level agreement. These service level agreements provide clarity to all involved on what funding is to be provided and what service is expected in return for that funding.</p><p>The service providers operate independently of Tusla and are responsible for their own internal resource management including the recruitment of employees and the terms and conditions under which their staff are employed. The remuneration of the staff of these bodies is therefore a matter for these organisations as employers.  </p><p>The commissioning of services is an operational matter for Tusla. Section 56 (2) requires that Tusla determines the maximum funding it proposes to make available during the course of each year under each arrangement and the level of service it expects to receive in return for that funding. </p><p>Section 56 (14) is clear that Tusla's arrangements with such providers do &quot;<i>not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other</i>'.</p><p>The net funding available to Tusla is determined annually as part of the estimates process and notified to the agency through my annual Performance Statement. In response to the Performance Statement, Tusla will prepare a Business Plan for 2023. In this way the precise level of funding to be allocated to such section 56 organisations for the delivery of specific services will be determined by Tusla, having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2023. </p><p>Following Budget 2023, I am pleased to announce that Tusla's funding allocation will be &euro;935m in 2023, an increase 4% on 2022. This underlines my commitment to supporting Tusla and its service delivery partners. The Government greatly appreciates the valuable work of the community and voluntary sector to assist Tusla with its statutory remit and in achieving its strategic objectives. </p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 50,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 39,000 of those have been referred to this Department seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted. </p>  <p>  The priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response. The scale of response to this crisis has been unprecedented and Irish people have displayed an incredible level of generosity in their support and pledges of accommodation. </p>  <p>  Pledges of accommodation made to the Irish Red Cross, whether for property vacant or shared, are disseminated geographically to Local Authorities and NGO implementing partners for activation. As the details supplied by the Deputy confirm, vacant pledges are assessed by the local authority. Shared pledges are invited to move forward through the Garda Vetting process which is coordinated by the Red Cross. This process can take some time dependent on the circumstances of the pledge and the requirements of the beneficiary.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the particular pledged accommodation to which he refers has been notified to the local authority in question with a view to having a beneficiary of international protection matched to that property.</p>  <p>  I trust this information is of assistance.</p></reply>

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. </p>  <p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance is not included in the list of income disregards for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme as it is, generally speaking, a short term temporary payment made whilst awaiting a decision on an established/long term social welfare payment. As soon as a person goes on to an eligible payment e.g. disability allowance, this would be considered a change in circumstances (under the Student Grant Scheme -see details below).</p>  <p>  Where the Supplementary Welfare Allowance is held for 15 consecutive calendar months, it is deemed an eligible long-term payment for the special rate of maintenance under the Student Grant Scheme.  The Disability Allowance is also an eligible long term payment for the special rate of Student Grant and is an income disregard if it is being paid to the applicant.</p>  <p>  I am not familiar with the particulars of this case however, students can determine their eligibility at susi.ie/eligibility/income/. The student may also wish to discuss his eligibility for SUSI assistance by calling the SUSI Support Desk on 0818 888 777.</p>  <p>  As outlined above, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same.</p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020/21 academic year. I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

Undergraduate students eligible for SUSI supports have this contribution paid, in part of in full, on their behalf under my Departments Student Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  The once off &euro;1,000 support relates specifically to the student contribution payable by student&rsquo;s eligible for free tuition fees under the Department free fees schemes in academic year 22/23. It will reduce the student contribution payable from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22/23. This additional level of support towards free tuition fees will benefit c.94,000 additional students. </p>  <p>  The reduction will be administered with the assistance of the Higher Education Institutions a student is attending. It is anticipated that students paying the student contribution in instalments will have the amount reduced from their next instalment by the HEI. Students who paid their 2022/23 student contribution in full will receive a refund or credit from the HEI attended. Officials are working with the HEA and the sector to finalise the details of this allocation and HEIs will communicate with students directly.</p>  <p>  Furthermore I have been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the value of the student contribution share, as paid by students and families compared to the states contribution, is too high. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2023, I made two changes to student contribution thresholds reduce the cost of education for students and families (for college year 2023/24): </p>  <p>  - increased the income limit from &euro;55,240 to &euro;62,000 for students to avail of the 50% Undergraduate Student Contribution </p>  <p>  - new support to the value of &euro;500 for families on qualifying incomes earning between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000. </p>  <p>  In considering the matter of the payment of the remaining &euro;2,000 contribution for academic year 22/23, my Department has previously requested that higher education institutions put in place arrangements to facilitate the payment of the student contribution in instalments. The standard payment instalment option is of payment in two instalments and aligns with the two semesters of the academic year.</p>  <p>  As autonomous bodies the institutions are responsible for implementation of policy and procedure in relation to the collection of the student contribution outside the general scheme of payment in two instalments. It is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways to student needs. I would encourage any student in need of assistance, including a need to access a payment instalment plan, to engage with their institution to discuss the range of options and supports available for their course, including fees.</p>  <p>  Additionally, for any student experiencing difficulties currently, there is a significant allocation to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis and I would encourage students to contact their access office to avail of these funds.</p>  <p>  Overall, the cost of living package, to take effect before the end of 2022, includes:</p>  <p>  - A once-off &euro;1,000 state financial support towards the undergraduate student contribution fee for higher education students eligible for the free fees initiative;</p>  <p>  - A once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices;</p>  <p>  - A once-off extra payment for all student maintenance grant recipients;</p>  <p>  - A once-off increase of &euro;1,000 in the support to SUSI qualified Post Graduate students, increasing from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500;</p>  <p>  - A further &euro;8 million investment in the Student Assistance Fund  for the 2022/23 academic year.</p></reply>

The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p><p>With regard to the specific application, I have been advised by my officials that the student in question submitted an application to SUSI on 8th July 2022.  The application proceeded through the assessment process and the reckonable income was found to be over the threshold for grant assistance. A change of circumstance was declared by the student.Further documentation was requested from the applicant on 15th and 30<sup>th</sup>August 2022.  SUSI reviewed the application based on the projected 2022 income however the outcome had no impact on SUSI&rsquo;S earlier decision. </p><p>As of 28<sup>th</sup>September 2022 no Notice of Appeal has been received from the student by SUSI.</p><p>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe. Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie</p><p>However, article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2022 provides for a review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year. Where a student experiences a change of circumstances during the course of their studies, he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed at helpdesk@SUSI.ie quoting Internal Review in the Subject line.</p><p>This Department also provides funding for the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The fund is available in various publicly funded higher education institutions. The SAF provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials.</p><p>The SAF is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.  Further details of the fund is available from the Access Office in the higher education institution attended.  Further information on the SAF is available at www.studentfinance.ie.</p></reply>

All students eligible for the free fees schemes receive state support whereby the State pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution (currently &euro;3,000 per annum). </p>  <p>Students attending postgraduate courses are not eligible for the free fees schemes and pay tuition fees as determined by the institution attended. Therefore the once off student contribution reduction of &euro;1,000 in 22/23 cannot apply to students undertaking a course of postgraduate study. Higher Education Institutions are autonomous institutions and therefore it is a matter for individual institutions to determine the rate of tuition fees for postgraduate academic programmes.  </p></reply>

Undergraduate students eligible for SUSI supports have this contribution paid, in part of in full, on their behalf under my Departments Student Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  The once off &euro;1,000 support relates specifically to the student contribution payable by student&rsquo;s eligible for free tuition fees under the Department free fees schemes in academic year 22/23. It will reduce the student contribution payable from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22/23. This additional level of support towards free tuition fees will benefit c.94,000 additional students.</p>  <p>  The reduction will be administered with the assistance of the Higher Education Institutions a student is attending. It is anticipated that students paying the student contribution in instalments will have the amount reduced from their next instalment by the HEI. Students who paid their 2022/23 student contribution in full will receive a refund or credit from the HEI attended. Officials are working with the HEA and the sector to finalise the details of this allocation and HEIs will communicate with students directly.</p>  <p>  Furthermore I have been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the value of the student contribution share, as paid by students and families compared to the states contribution, is too high.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2023, I made two changes to student contribution thresholds reduce the cost of education for students and families (for college year 2023/24):</p>  <p>  - increased the income limit from &euro;55,240 to &euro;62,000 for students to avail of the 50% Undergraduate Student Contribution;</p>  <p>  - new support to the value of &euro;500 for families on qualifying incomes earning between &euro;62,000 and &euro;100,000. </p>  <p>  In considering the matter of the payment of the remaining &euro;2,000 contribution for academic year 22/23, my Department has previously requested that higher education institutions put in place arrangements to facilitate the payment of the student contribution in instalments. The standard payment instalment option is of payment in two instalments and aligns with the two semesters of the academic year.</p>  <p>  As autonomous bodies the institutions are responsible for implementation of policy and procedure in relation to the collection of the student contribution outside the general scheme of payment in two instalments. It is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways to student needs. I would encourage any student in need of assistance, including a need to access a payment instalment plan, to engage with their institution to discuss the range of options and supports available for their course, including fees.</p>  <p>  Additionally, for any student experiencing difficulties currently, there is a significant allocation to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis and I would encourage students to contact their access office to avail of these funds.</p>  <p>  Overall, the cost of living package, to take effect before the end of 2022, includes:</p>  <p>  - A once-off &euro;1,000 state financial support towards the undergraduate student contribution fee for higher education students eligible for the free fees initiative;</p>  <p>  - A once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices;</p>  <p>  - A once-off extra payment for all student maintenance grant recipients;</p>  <p>  - A once-off increase of &euro;1,000 in the support to SUSI qualified Post Graduate students, increasing from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500;</p>  <p>  - A further &euro;8 million investment in the Student Assistance Fund  for the 2022/23 academic year.</p></reply>

However, PhD students may self-fund, or receive support from either their higher education institution or some other body - including private funders. Higher education institutions are autonomous institutions as provided for in legislation and on that basis the management of academic affairs, including the criteria governing the level of stipends paid to PhD students, is solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p><p>With that in view, as an immediate and tangible relief against the challenges of the rising cost of living, in this Budget I am introducing:</p><p>- a once off payment in 2022 of &euro;500 for PhD students who receive an IRC or SFI award.</p><p>- a &euro;500 increase to the stipend baseline in 2023 for PhD students who receive an IRC or SFI award.</p><p>PhD students recipients may also, in certain circumstances, qualify for support from SUSI.</p><p>I should add that I am considering commencing a review of current PhD training provision, including supports for students such as stipends. I have asked my Department to set out a scope for such a review, building on previous work in this area and with a view to framing practical actions that can be implemented within the resources available and competing needs.</p></reply>

The target group of "those most in need" was defined in terms of the dependents of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, to effectively target this cohort, the income limit for the special rate of grant is aligned to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension plus the maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years.</p>  <p>  In assessing an application for the 2022/23 academic year, SUSI will have regard to the following qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant:</p>  <p>  1. The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant;</p>  <p>  2. Total gross reckonable income for the 2021 tax year, after income disregards and Child Dependent Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,500;</p>  <p>  3. As at 31st December 2021, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2022.</p>  <p>  Following on from a &euro;200 increase to all grant rates in Budget 2022, I announced further increases as part of the Cost of Living and Budget measures in Budget 2023. </p>  <p>  As part of the Government's cost of living measures, every SUSI maintenance grant recipient, including those on the special rate, will receive an additional once-off payment equivalent to one month&rsquo;s maintenance to be paid by the end of December 2022.</p>  <p>  Effective from January 2023, the special rate and Band 1 rate of maintenance will increase by 14% and all other maintenance grant rates will increase by 10%.  Students in the current academic year will see their grant payments increase proportionately once this measure comes into effect from January 2023.  The revised grant for the Academic year 2023/24 for the special rate non-adjacent will then rise to &euro;6,971 and for the special rate adjacent will rise to &euro;2,936.</p>  <p>  In addition for the 2022/2023 Academic Year a further &euro;8 million of funding has been secured for the Student Assistance Fund for the current academic year.  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The Fund provides financial support to students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending college. Students can apply for SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. It is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification. It is designed to provide a source of financial support in addition to a SUSI grant.</p>  <p>  Applications can be made under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) through the Access Office in the third level institution you are attending.

Undergraduate students eligible for SUSI supports have this contribution paid, in part of in full, on their behalf under my Departments Student Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  The once off reduction of &euro;1,000 relates specifically to the student contribution payable by student&rsquo;s eligible for free tuition fees under my Department's free fees schemes in academic year 22/23 and will reduce the student contribution payable from &euro;3,000 to &euro;2,000 in 22/23. In this regard all full time undergraduate students eligible for free fees and paying the student contribution will benefit from this measure.</p>  <p>  In the 2021/22 academic year there were over 246,000 enrolled in HEA-funded higher education institutions. As the 2022/23 academic year is only now getting underway, we do not have enrolment figures yet however I can advise the Deputy that in 22/23 it is estimated that over 149,000 Irish and EU full time undergraduate students will be eligible for free fees. This means in addition to the SUSI eligible students receiving a student contribution support (estimated at over 55,000 in academic year 22/23) an estimated 94,000 free fees eligible students will benefit from this measure alone at a cost of c.&euro;95.6million.</p>  <p>  Students not eligible for the free fees schemes pay a full tuition fee as determined by the higher education institution attended. These institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees scheme is a matter for the relevant institution to determine. In this regard a student contribution does not apply and therefore the once off student contribution reduction of &euro;1,000 in 22/23 cannot benefit students that are not eligible for free fees.</p>  <p>  However, for tuition fee students supports are available to full time students via the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. The Student Grant Scheme, administered by SUSI, provides grant assistance to students pursuing an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. Students can determine their eligibility at susi.ie/eligibility/income/.</p>  <p>  As part of the cost of living measures I secured additional supports for students including:</p>  <p>  - A once-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices;</p>  <p>  - A once-off extra payment for all student maintenance grant recipients;</p>  <p>  - A once-off increase of &euro;1,000 in the support to SUSI qualified Post Graduate students, increasing from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500;</p>  <p>  - A further &euro;8 million investment in the Student Assistance Fund  for the 2022/23 academic year.</p>  <p>  For any student experiencing difficulties currently, there is a significant allocation to the aforementioned Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis and I would encourage students to contact their access office to avail of these funds.</p></reply>

Its latest iteration was published in January 2021 and can be accessed on: www.gov.ie/en/publication/00d67-higher-education-research-and-development-survey-2018-2019/.</p><p>The next HERD survey will be published in December 2022.</p><p>According to the latest data from the HERD Survey,(2018) there are a total of 9,964 PhD and research masters students. Of this, Irish HEIs had 2,120 internally-funded PhD and Research Master students. In the HERD Survey, 'Internally-funded' includes students who receive stipends, who are wholly funded by their institution's internal scheme (Recurrent Grant), who get only fees paid by the HEI, and staff who are doing PhDs/Master's in their own HEI.</p><p>As at 1/9/22, there were 2,022 PhD Students directly attributed to active SFI awards and the Irish Research Council is currently supporting 1143 PhD researchers across its range of funding programmes.</p><p>As approximately 4,000 students are understood to self-fund, the Budget measure covers approximately half of all PhD students supported by a research funder.</p></reply>

The programme provides investors with the opportunity to invest in Ireland.

Over 1,400 applications have been successful under the IIP to date with the value of investments approved over &euro;1bn.</p>  <p>  The IIP is not a visa scheme or a citizenship scheme. It offers successful applicants a Stamp 4 Immigration permission for themselves and their immediate family members for an initial two year period and is renewed thereafter subject to the scheme&rsquo;s criteria being met.</p>  <p>  Given the significant immigration benefits accruing to successful applicants under the programme all such persons are subject to rigorous screening by my Department as to their suitability during the application process. This screening includes due diligence and sanction checks in respect of applicants, and reputable international databases are accessed for this purpose, as and when required, to ensure that only reputable individuals are eligible for permission. These rigorous checks are aimed at protecting the integrity of the programme and the State&rsquo;s interests.</p></reply>

Observations on the operation of the scheme were made by stakeholders either via meetings with the Review Group and/or submissions received. Almost all stakeholders provided observations on the scheme.  It is intended to bring the cross-departmental group's report and recommendations to Government in the near future.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Oversight Committee, chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine continues to oversee the scheme as currently structured. As of 29 September 2022, a total of 520 individuals, employed by 101 vessel owners, have been granted permission under the Atypical Working Scheme since its introduction and there are 277 individuals, employed by  66 vessel owners, currently holding a letter of approval under the scheme granted between 1 July 2021 and 29 September 2022.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Atypical Working Scheme (AWS) was established as a cross Departmental response to address the matter of non-EEA workers on certain categories of vessels in the Irish fishing fleet, who are not currently eligible for an employment permit under the system operated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>  <p>  The scheme provided, for the first time, a framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish fishing fleet and was welcomed as a solution to the risk of exploitation and to guarantee employment rights and protections to non-EEA fishers availing of the scheme.</p></reply>

This order currently determines that only male persons committed to prison on remand, pending trial or sentence by the Special Criminal Court shall be committed to Portlaoise Prison. Due to the smaller number of sittings of this court compared to other courts, there are fewer remand and trial prisoners in custody in Portlaoise prison than other prisons.</p><p>I am informed by the Prison Service that on a regular basis, for a number of reasons, including sentence management and security and for operational reasons, prisoners are transferred into Portlaoise Prison from other locations to serve their sentence.</p><p>The total bed capacity of Portlaoise Prison is currently 291, with 40 in A Block, 181 in C Block and 70 in E Block.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the E Block in Portlaoise Prison accommodates subversive prisoners only.

The Government has provided significant capital funding to the Irish Prison Service in order to enhance the existing prison infrastructure, eliminate the practice known as slopping out and to provide additional capacity where required.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the works completed in recent years to modernise the entire Mountjoy Prison complex, the construction of a new prison in Cork and the provision of additional prisoner accommodation in the Midlands Prison. In addition, the Training Unit Place of Detention which is newly refurbished has now reopened as a centre for older prisoners. </p><p>Additional works on prison infrastructure such as enhancements to kitchen and laundry facilities, upgrades to fire and safety systems, improvements to CCTV and security systems, prison window replacement and enhancement to ICT infrastructure have also been completed across the prison estate during the lifetime of recent Strategic Plans. </p><p>A major capital development project at Limerick Prison is due for completion by the end of 2022. This will provide greatly enhanced accommodation for both male and female prisoners and will include the provision of other ancillary services for prisoners including workshops, new laundry and prison kitchen. Staff facilities will also be catered for in the provision of a staff canteen, locker rooms and administration support offices. </p><p>The Irish Prison Service has now commenced work on the development of a new Strategic Plan for 2023 &ndash; 2025 which will include specific strategic objectives on further enhancing the prison estate. </p><p>The commitments included in the new Strategic Plan will be in line with funding allocated to the Irish Prison Service in the current National Development Plan.</p><p>In relation to prison developments the National Development Plan includes:  <b></b></p><p>- Investment for the improvement of facilities in Shelton Abbey, Loughan House Open Centre, the D&oacute;chas Centre, and Wheatfield Place of Detention;</p><p>- Priority projects at Castlerea and Portlaoise Prisons in respect of the necessary construction of new kitchens; and</p><p>- Other investment to be progressed over the years 2022 to 2025 include, ICT infrastructure and systems, fleet modernisation, video-linking infrastructure, safety, security and carbon reduction refurbishment works and general upgrading of equipment and facilities.</p><p>All such developments are subject to cost benefit analysis and are progressed in line with the Public Spending Code obligations.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware significant growth has been experienced in the remand prison population in recent years which has resulted in significant pressure on remand prison facilities including Cloverhill Prison. The Irish Prison Service is currently undertaking a strategic assessment exercise on the potential for additional accommodation at Cloverhill Prison in line with the requirements of the Public Spending Code.</p></reply>

In the main, they fall under the remit of local authorities. Under the Roads Act 1993, it is the responsibility of local authorities to protect the public's right to access public rights of way in each local authority area.</p>  <p>  As regards the private rights of way that are known as prescriptive rights of way - the Deputy may be aware that I have already brought forward the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2021, which was enacted and came into operation on 30 November 2021. Prescriptive rights of way are a different type of legal right from public rights of way, as they serve the property of a private owner, rather than belonging to members of the public generally.</p>  <p>  The effect of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2021 was to protect important prescriptive rights of way, including some rights for an owner to access their home or farm, that had been enjoyed for many years without dispute, but had not been formally registered.</p>  <p>  Following the Act, a person who claims to be entitled to a prescriptive right of way can still apply to register it with the Property Registration Authority of Ireland (PRAI), but is not obliged to do so. The Act removed a statutory cut-off date for such applications to be made by 1 December 2021, and ensured that periods of long use that were acquired before or during the years 2009-2021 can still be counted in a claim made after that date.</p>  <p>  In addition, a time-bound review is under preparation, to examine the overall law relating to prescriptive rights of way, and to identify whether any further changes are desirable, following the 2021 Act, to ensure that the law in this area is placed on a sustainable long-term footing.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays a vital role in enforcing road traffic law and in making our roads safer for all road users, including vulnerable road users, such as cyclists.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Minister Ryan that the protection of vulnerable road users is prioritised in the new Road Safety Strategy. Protecting vulnerable road users involves a range of actions aside from legislative and law enforcement measures. Improvements in infrastructure, such as dedicated cycle lanes, will reduce the danger by keeping vulnerable road users separate from motorized traffic. The Government has committed to investing up to &euro;1.8 billion in cycling and walking infrastructure during its lifetime. I understand that the Road Safety Authority also engages in public information and education initiatives to raise driver awareness of the specific risks to vulnerable road users.    </p>  <p>  As regards the establishment of a dedicated online portal for the submission of video evidence of potential violations of road traffic legislation, the Deputy may be aware that the current Traffic Watch facility allows for members of the public to report driver behaviour to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Matters reported via this facility are forwarded to the relevant District Office for investigation. Similarly, citizens may make complaints to any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or through the Garda website.</p>  <p>  Under Action 29 of the Road Safety Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will explore the potential of an online portal for road users to upload footage of road traffic offences which could assist in prosecution. This action is due to be completed by Q4 of this year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are strict standards in legislation relating to photographic evidence obtained by Garda&iacute;. While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that private dash cam footage may be used during a prosecution, its use must be in accordance with best evidential practices and entails ensuring structures exist around continuity of evidence.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has further advised that any decision to allow film by members of the public to be used in evidence in road traffic cases would raise questions of reliability of, and possible tampering with, the apparatus used, as well as potential privacy issues. It might also raise questions about why Garda apparatus was held to a standard not required of private individuals, if both were ultimately to be treated as reliable evidence. </p>  <p>  Road traffic enforcement remains a core policing function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda National Roads Policing Bureau ensures a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement measures and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State Agencies, notably the Road Safety Authority.</p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to the employment of specific enforcement operations.</p>  <p>  I would of course encourage any member of the public to report any incidents of dangerous driving directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the NMBI has confirmed to my Department that  all nurses and midwives from overseas applying to join the Register do so through the digital portal, MyNMBI. This system, which was introduced in 2020, digitised the recognition and registration process for all applicants and registrants. As a result, all overseas applicants upload their documentation to the portal and the documentation is then assessed by NMBI. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the NMBI has a number of statutory obligations to protect the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and to protect the integrity of the practice of the professions of nursing and midwifery. Maintaining a high level of scrutiny in the assessment of registration applications is an essential element of this protection.  In all cases, it is necessary for NMBI to secure independent verification from overseas regulators. Some of these regulators issue the required documents in hardcopy format only, by posting directly to NMBI. It is necessary therefore, in these limited circumstances, that the digitised system has the flexibility to allow documents to be uploaded manually. The digitised system, MyNMBI, has facilitated the processing of an increasing number of overseas applications which has resulted in more nurses and midwives joining the Irish healthcare sector.</p></reply>

At present, this objective is supported by the National Positive Ageing Strategy (2013), which provides a blueprint for whole-of-government policy-making and service-delivery in partnership with the community and voluntary sector. However, acknowledging the disproportionately negative impact of the pandemic on older persons, the Programme for Government (2020) commits to establishing a commission to examine care and supports for older people. </p>  <p>  Desk-research has been undertaken within the Department of Health in preparation for the establishment of a commission on care. This encompassed an international review of relevant initiatives undertaken in other jurisdictions in recent years as well as some preliminary project-planning. The conclusions of this initial scoping exercise, along with an outline proposal for the commission, were presented to Minister Butler earlier this year. It is envisaged that the commission will support a whole-of-government approach to examining the plethora of existing policies and strategies which are of relevance to supporting positive and healthy ageing. Drawing on lessons learnt internationally as well as on stakeholder-engagement, it is also anticipated that the commission will make recommendations to effectively address the gaps which currently exist in the policy-landscape.</p>  <p>  While the terms of reference, membership and timelines for the commission have yet to be determined, it is anticipated that, staffing resources within the Department of Health permitting, the commission will be established in the new year.</p></reply>

Individuals with full medical card eligibility can access certain health services free of charge, including General Practitioner (GP) services, prescribed drugs and medicines, in-patient/out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic, and aural services. In addition to the provision of clinically prescribed aids and appliances, they may also have access to community care services, such as occupational therapy and physiotherapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions under the community drug schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The criteria of that Act would not cover the introduction of the proposed courses under the community drug schemes.</p>  <p>  The HSE may utilise another agency to provide health services. Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 (as amended) provide for such arrangements between the HSE and other agencies to deliver health and social care services. Once a need has been identified, the establishment of such arrangements usually require a procurement process by the HSE to identify appropriate service providers to fill that need. The provision of the proposed courses would require further consideration in that regard.</p></reply>

There are also a range of schemes that assist individuals in meeting their medical costs.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a wide range of medical and surgical aids and appliances, free of charge to eligible persons following assessment by a relevant health professional. </p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  The Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) ensures that no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines who are not eligible for a medical card. Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection administer the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme and the Fuel allowance, which may assist individuals with their energy costs. Further information on these can be found at: </p>  <p> www.gov.ie/en/collection/d5554-supplementary-welfare-allowance/</p>  <p> www.gov.ie/en/service/00aa38-fuel-allowance/</p>  <p>  Finally, as announced in Budget 2023, every household in Ireland will receive three &euro;200 energy credits, totalling &euro;600, towards the costs of their electricity over the coming months.</p></reply>

Likewise, patients that avail of online only GP service providers do so on a private basis. Neither I, as Minister, nor the HSE has a remit over allocating private patients to a new GP as the HSE has no contract for the care of non-GMS patients. Private patients are free to choose another practice in the area to meet their health care requirements. </p>  <p>  The GP, the GP practice, or another legal entity providing a GP service, is the data controller for their patient's medical records.

The role of CORU is to protect the public by regulating the health and social care professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended), including setting the standards that health and social care professionals must meet to be eligible for registration and maintaining registers of persons who meet those standards There are two forms of application to CORU: applications for the recognition of qualifications received outside the State and applications for registration.</p>  <p>  Professional qualifications awarded outside the State are assessed through a process of &ldquo;recognition&rdquo; which involves expert assessment of a qualification&rsquo;s alignment with the standards of proficiency required in Ireland, and assessment of professional experience and lifelong learning where required. </p>  <p>  Where a health and social care professional qualifies outside the State and applies to register in Ireland, they must apply for the recognition of their qualification. EU/EEA applicants have the right to have their qualifications assessed in accordance with the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and Directive 2005/36/EC on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications and the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2017 (SI No 8 of 2017). Once a complete file has been submitted to CORU, i.e., one containing all the required documentation, a decision must issue within four months.</p>  <p>  The Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill 2022 has been introduced to the Oireachtas. The primary purpose of the Bill is to address an issue which currently prevents holders of UK medical degrees from accessing medical intern training posts in Ireland. The Bill does not affect the recognition process that applies to those who seek to practise as Medical Scientists. </p>  <p>  I met with the Chairperson and CEO of CORU last year and raised the issue of timeframes for the recognition of qualifications and registration applications. Following our discussion, several measures have been initiated by CORU aimed at further reducing timeframes. </p>  <p>  Until last year applicants were required to complete the recognition process before initiating the registration process unless they had confirmed job offers. All applicants are now invited to initiate an application for registration as soon as they have submitted a complete application file to the recognition department.

However, it is important to note that regardless of whether it is a private, voluntary or public nursing home, the resident's financial contribution is the same; the price of care only affects levels of state funding and has no direct impact on the resident.</p><p>  A Value for Money (VFM) Review on Nursing Home Care Costs was undertaken between March 2018 and March 2021 under the direction of a Steering Committee comprising representatives of the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the Health Service Executive (HSE), and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), led by an independent chair.  </p><p>  The VFM Review sought to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector. The review was published in December 2021 and can be viewed by following this link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/3859f-a-value-for-money-review-of-nursing-home-care-costs/ </p><p>  Among the issues raised were the pay costs of staff in nursing homes, the dependency levels of residents, energy costs, and medical supplies charges to the NHSS. The report found that the cost differential is largely driven by variances in staff-to-resident ratios and the skill mix in public and private nursing homes. However, the review also found that establishing like-for-like comparisons was complex and not always possible, especially when considering differences in dependency levels.</p><p>  The VFM Review made nine recommendations which the Department continues to take forward. It should be noted that many of the recommendations from the report were already in progress and overlap with existing workstreams. </p><p>- The Department has set out a plan for how each of the recommendations will be addressed and by which organisation. Progress against these recommendations will be monitored through existing NHSS oversight structures. </p><p>- The Department continues to engage with the NTPF on a range of topics in respect of data sharing and analysis - the additional types of data that might be required to inform future policy-making is still being considered.</p><p>- Funding has been secured for an additional 128 InterRAI Single Assessment Tool care needs facilitators and recruitment has commenced. The Department intends that InterRAI Single Assessment Tool will be rolled-out to long-term residential care when the initial phase of recruitment is complete. </p><p>- The respective home support and residential care policy teams within the Department are currently engaging to evaluate the testing of a reformed model of service delivery that will provide the basis for the development of a system of care banding. Testing is ongoing in four pilot sites and an interim report is expected in November.</p><p>- Significant progress continues to be made in relation to Safe Staffing and Skill Mix Framework for Residential Care and will continue throughout 2022 with a view to developing national policy. The Department expects policy implementation to commence in 2023.</p><p>- Terms of reference for an extensive review and audit process of the public cost of care, while still under development, are temporarily paused to allow the HSE complete their own ongoing audit of public bed capacity. Nevertheless, the Department expects to be able to commission an independent review in the latter part of the year.</p><p>- The HSE have committed to publishing a list showing the actual eligible costs, highlighting any variances against the maximum cost of care, incurred by each nursing home in respect of the calendar year 2022 onwards. </p><p>- The Department of Health and the HSE continue to work on a number of initiatives to support both the discharge of patients from an acute setting and demand from the community, depending on the assessed care needs of the individual client/patient. It is expected that a review of the impacts of these initiatives will be concluded by the end of 2022.</p><p>- The Government is committed to the implementation of the 86 COVID-19 Expert Panel recommendations. While it is accepted that this broad programme of wide-ranging and complex reform will take time to implement, the fourth progress report on the implementation of the recommendations, published in June 2022, highlights the important progress that has already taken place across a number of areas and sets out clearly the structures and processes that have been established to ensure continued implementation.</p></reply>

It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected. </p><p>  The Government has provided substantial supports to the nursing homes sector over the course of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the Temporary Assistance Payments Scheme (TAPS) since spring 2020. TAPS continues in effect and the Government has now agreed to extend the scheme for nursing homes to the end of the year. The scheme will be refocused on addressing this year's inflationary pressures related to energy and heating. Details are being finalised and these will be communicated in the coming days.</p><p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual Nursing Homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p><p>  - Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home- Local market prices- Historic prices- Overall budgetary capacity</p><p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  It should also be noted that the Department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021. </p><p>A Value for Money (VFM) Review on Nursing Home Care Costs has also been carried out under the direction of a Steering Committee with an independent chair. The VFM Review sought to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.

This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, there has been significant and ongoing consideration of the impact of COVID-19 and the evolution of the response to it, as evidence and knowledge emerged and as national and international understanding of the virus evolved. Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. Various examinations and reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons have been undertaken.</p>  <p>  In particular, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing approach to the management and mitigation of risk to older persons resident in nursing homes as the pandemic evolved. This report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  One of the most important things we can take from the experiences of the past two years is our learning and understanding of the challenges facing the nursing home sector. Through engagement with key stakeholders in this sector, including residents, their families and advocacy groups, we are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Nursing Homes Expert Panel and a programme of reform is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders to ensure an improved quality of service and experience for residents into the future. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in implementing the recommendations of the Expert Panel, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, and work to progress medium and longer term reform recommendations is ongoing. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published, the latest published on 21 June 2022, and all Progress Reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Both I and the Government have been concerned that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services. </p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders, including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. I am also using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings and restorations. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1st May. The numbers of patients being seen and the numbers of treatments being provided under the DTSS have started to increase in recent months. Patients are also accessing the preventative scale and polish which has been reintroduced, which is a positive development.</p>  <p>  In addition, further funding has also been provided in Budget 2023 to assist the HSE in providing care to adult medical card holders who meet the HSE&rsquo;s criteria for emergency care.</p>  <p>  These are interim measures designed to address immediate concerns with the Scheme pending a more substantive reform of dental services. It is my intention that this is addressed in the context of the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy, which sets out a body of substantial services reform. Work is underway to design a governance framework to oversee and facilitate root and branch service reform.</p></reply>

These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland. This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community. Details of the fund including its administration are being finalised.</p><p>The HSE, in preparing its National Service Plan, will examine how services, including relevant KPIs, can be progressed in 2023 within the overall increased envelope of funding for disability services.</p></reply>

Budget 2023 reiterated the commitment made last year to expand GP care without charges to all children aged 6 &amp;amp; 7, and provides for the expansion of GP care without charges to people who earn the median household income of approximately &euro;46,000 or less. It is envisaged that these measures will be supported by a significant package of additional capacity supports to GP practices; consultations are to be held with the IMO on how to best to implement these capacity supports. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, and while GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing, the Government recognises there is a need to support rural GP practices and to make establishing a rural practice a more attractive prospect. The proposed package of capacity supports announced in Budget 2023 builds on steps already taken by the Government to increase the number of GPs working throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement the additional annual expenditure provided for general practice will have increased by &euro;211.6m per annum by 2023. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022.  The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead. The ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, preparatory work has commenced on a strategic review of GP services to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future. The review will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice in general and in rural areas specifically, and will set out the measures necessary to deliver a sustainable general practice.</p></reply>

This year, the Government&rsquo;s Waiting List action plan also assigned funding of &euro;5.5 million to primary care child psychology services. </p><p>In 2022, the primary care psychology waiting list initiative has enabled almost 2,400 young people to access the service than otherwise would have. The initiative consists of work being implemented across the CHOs to tackle this waiting list and includes validation exercises, increased tele-screening and tele-consults, and increased provision of individual and group workshops as appropriate. Almost 2,500 young people have been removed from the primary care psychology waiting list through the work of this initiative.</p><p>The HSE has also targeted the recruitment of staff psychologists, clinical psychologists, and administrative support staff, with campaigns underway across the CHOs. A national recruitment campaign to replenish the psychology assistant panel is also underway, which is expected to have a positive impact on activity and waitlist trends.</p><p>Although primary care psychology is not the focus of the Enhanced Community Care Programme, the service will benefit from the new network structures, improvements in multi-disciplinary working and focus on local population needs.</p><p>As occurs each year following the Budget, discussions will now take place with the HSE on details relating to specific service initiatives in the context of preparing the HSE Service Plan 2023, including that for Mental Health.</p></reply>

In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact.</p>  <p>  Gluten-free products were removed from the list of reimbursable items under the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme, with several other products, in September 2012. The marketplace has evolved whereby such products are widely available in supermarkets at a more reasonable price than was historically costed to the State when they were available in pharmacies through the statutory schemes, and without incurring the further extra costs of a dispensing fee. There are currently no plans to reinstate these products on the list of reimbursable items under the GMS and other community drug schemes.</p>  <p>  However, possession of a medical card may assist with other medical services. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. </p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  A person can claim tax relief for certain food products if they have specific dietary requirements due to a medical condition. This applies to persons with coeliac disease where they require gluten free foods specifically manufactured to be gluten free.

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Regional Health Areas across the country.</p><p>Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, provided through the public health system. In this regard, funding was secured in Budget 2023 to support access to advanced AHR treatments, including, crucially, to allow the commencement of Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care.</p><p>  This investment will facilitate the first steps to be taken towards the provision of a complete publicly-provided fertility service, which is the ultimate objective of Government. In particular, it will allow the historic development of the first National Advanced AHR Centre, delivering IVF and ICSI through a wholly public clinic. This is scheduled to open in the early part of 2024 and will provide a nationwide service, with all six Regional Fertility Hubs having equity of access for onward referral to it, via a shared care pathway. Subject to the provision of additional funding in future, it is envisaged that additional National Advanced AHR Centres will be developed and become operational on a phased basis elsewhere in the country.</p><p>  The 2023 allocation will also be utilised to support the Regional Fertility Hubs in order to expand their scope of services next year by introducing the provision of IUI (intrauterine insemination), a significant, yet less complex and less intrusive, component of AHR treatment. </p><p>  Separately, as an interim measure, I have instructed that some funding be made available to support access to advanced AHR treatment via private providers from September 2023. </p><p>  My officials, in conjunction with NWIHP, are now planning for the operationalisation of both the publicly- and privately- provided service, including the development of a national eligibility framework, as well as determining how the interim funding for private treatments will be provided to individual eligible patients. I expect that this process will involve, where appropriate, engagement with relevant stakeholder groups. </p><p>  Overall, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system.

Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, particularly those resident in nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007, as amended, provides the overarching regulatory framework for the nursing home sector with further detailed requirements set out in Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and Quality Standards. Under the Health Act 2007, as amended, and related Regulations, the registered provider is responsible and accountable for the quality of care and safety of residents in nursing homes (designated centres) and all nursing homes are required to have a clear complaints procedure in place. Part 10 of the Care and Welfare Regulations sets out the requirements in this regard. The person-in-charge of the nursing home will be able to provide information on the complaints process in place in the nursing home and assistance on how to make a complaint. If a complainant is unhappy with the response received, he or she can appeal the decision as provided for in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman can also examine complaints relating to the administrative actions of nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the nursing home concerned.</p>  <p>  In cases of complaint about a healthcare professional, the resident or family can also complain directly to the employee's professional regulatory body, for example the Nursing and Midwifery Board or the Irish Medical Council.</p>  <p>  For those nursing homes that are under the aegis of the Health Service Executive (HSE), there is a HSE-wide complaints process. Details of this process can be accessed on the HSE website at www.healthcomplaints.ie. </p>  <p>  Separately, HIQA welcomes information in relation to designated centres that come within its regulatory remit. As a regulator, HIQA has no legal role in examining individual complaints, however, the Authority does take into account all information it receives, including complaints from the public, when carrying out inspections and this range of information informs a risk-based approach to regulation. </p>  <p>  Currently, my Department is examining complaints processes across the nursing home sector including information on best practice, the level of standardisation, and the views of key stakeholders including residents and families, with a view to determining the need to further develop enablers such as policy, legislative and/or guidance instruments to strengthen and enhance current arrangements.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, the Patient Advocacy Service (PAS), which currently supports residents in HSE-operated nursing homes to make complaints, will begin its rollout to private nursing homes at the end of 2022. This is in line with a Programme for Government commitment to examine extending the remit of the Patient Advocacy Service to residents of long-term residential care facilities.</p></reply>

Throughout the pandemic, the response has been underpinned by our core national priorities of protecting the most vulnerable in society from the severe impacts of the disease, minimising the burden on the healthcare system, and continuing to keep schools and childcare facilities open. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic is not over. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer continues to closely monitor the epidemiological profile of the disease and provide advice in relation to ongoing decision-making processes in respect of the pandemic. The importance of ongoing vigilance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and specifically in relation to the autumn/winter 2022/2023 period, has been signalled through international guidance. Work has been underway in my Department with regard to preparedness and contingency planning for the coming winter season, which is traditionally a very challenging time for our health and social services. </p>  <p>  Government has previously acknowledged the importance of reviewing the response to the pandemic. Since the beginning of the response, there has been a clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic and, where necessary, to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has taken an adaptive approach to the elements of the response falling within its remit. It has continuously worked to capture and to apply lessons learned from the national and international COVID-19 response to date. The Department has demonstrated its commitment to learning lessons from pandemic response across multiple domains to date. </p>  <p>  In May 2020, Government established the Nursing Home Expert Panel which examined and advised on the COVID-19 response in long-term residential healthcare settings. The Expert Panel&rsquo;s report was published on 19th August 2020 is available here. The Fourth Progress Report on implementation of the recommendations of Expert Panel is available here.</p>  <p>  In January 2022, a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group (PHREAG) commenced its work with Terms of Reference approved by Government. It was tasked with identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and internationally with a view towards strengthening public health including health protection generally and future public health threat and pandemic preparedness specifically. Further details on the PHREAG are available here.</p>  <p>  In April 2022, the Minister for Health established the COVID-19 Advisory Group (CAG), to consider and advise on how best to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s medium to long-term preparedness for future challenges posed by COVID-19. The CAG has considered lessons learned from the pandemic in its work. The recommendations of the CAG, with relevant World Health Organization (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and European Commission guidance, have informed my Department&rsquo;s strategic approach to the management of COVID-19 for autumn/winter 2022/2023.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past two years. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p></reply>

This report set out the capacity requirements for health-funded disability services for the period up to 2032. In order to drive the process of implementing the recommendations of the Capacity Review, a Working Group was set up to develop an Action Plan for Disability Services for the period 2022-2025. This Group has now completed its work and the draft Action Plan is currently being finalised for approval. </p><p>  In recent years, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services. This year, the overall Budget for disability services in 2023 will be &euro;2.4 billion, including a significant level of funding for specialist disability services. Building on the previous year, this is an unprecedented level of funding for Disability services. It follows substantial increases in the budget in 2021 and 2022; and reflects this Government&rsquo;s commitment to strengthening the funding provided for the disability sector and working to act to address the shortfalls identified in the Disability Capacity Review.  </p><p>The following funding has been provided for 2023. <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Funding </b></th>       <th><b>Measure </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;109m </td>       <td>To support existing levels of service </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;4.3m </td>       <td>Digital Initiatives/Disability Awareness and Participation Fund </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;25m </td>       <td>Building Capacity (Core Services) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;39m </td>       <td>One off Costs associated with activity during Covid-19 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>A significant fund of up to &euro;100m has been allocated this year to support community based voluntary organisations who are such an essential pillar in the provision of Health services across country.  This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges being faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining key health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures affecting energy, heating and related costs.  These organisations are funded through the HSE to deliver a range of health and social care services on behalf of the HSE to communities around Ireland. This includes residential, day and ancillary services for people with a disability, older people, mental health services, palliative care services, addiction services and other health and social care services provided in the community. Details of the fund including its administration are being finalised.</p><p>The HSE, in preparing its National Service Plan, will examine how services, including relevant KPIs, can be progressed in 2023 within the overall increased envelope of funding for disability services.</p></reply>

The plan informed stakeholders of our targets for the delivery of afforestation, felling and forest road licences, and  of our commitment to reducing the backlog.  It represented a year-on-year increase of 30% on 2021, with a target of 5,250 licences.</p>  <p>  We are broadly keeping pace with our projections  with 3,629 licences issued to the end of September, or 92% of the target for this point in the year. We continue to process files faster than the rate of files being received and the backlog of files,  is continuing to steadily reduce. The number is now 1,734, down from 3,713 at the start of Q1, 3,325 at the start of Q2 and 2,121 at the start of Q3.</p>  <p>  I see great merit in signalling to forest owners, landowners, and the forest sector our intentions at the beginning of the year which is why I intend to publish a new Forestry Licensing Plan early in 2023.</p></reply>

The issues raised were considered in the context of Budget 2023 deliberations.</p><p>  On Tuesday 27th September, I announced details of my Department&rsquo;s 2023 Budget. The 2023 Estimates provide a gross Vote of &euro;2.14 billion, the highest ever level of funding for the Department, and represents an increase of &euro;283m on the 2022 provision, or a 13% increase overall, to support farmers, fishers, and rural and coastal communities.</p><p>  This budget supports farm families dealing with the immediate and ongoing fallout of the illegal invasion of Ukraine and lays the groundwork for strategic supports for the sector over the next five years, through the new &euro;10 billion CAP Strategic Plan (CSP).  I have secured up to &euro;500m in 2023 to support farmers in their efforts to tackle the challenges in climate, biodiversity and water quality, including funding for 30,000 places in a new flagship agri environment scheme, ACRES.  I am introducing an &euro;8m grant aid scheme to support the spreading of lime, as well as an enhanced Multi Species Sward / Red Clover scheme, helping  farmers deal with rising fertiliser prices and move towards the reduction of chemical fertiliser. I have also secured an increase in the TAMS budget to &euro;90m, to fund the proposed large-scale investment in on-farm renewables for farmers, subject to the approval of the European Commission. This will help fund the proposed increase to 60% grant rate and a standalone investment ceiling of &euro;90,000 for solar installation.</p><p>  Separately, I am seeking EU Commission approval for a new scheme to continue the beef welfare measures which were previously funded under BEEP-S. This new scheme will sit alongside the new &euro;150/cow Suckler Carbon Efficiency Scheme, and a &euro;20 million Sheep Welfare Scheme, maintaining the budget for targeted beef and sheep supports of over &euro;100 million. Beef and sheep farmers will also be well placed to benefit from the enhanced supports for fodder aid, for environmental measures and the supports available for the supports available for farmers transitioning to organic farming.</p><p>  While taxation policy is primarily the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance, I work closely with him to ensure that it is consistent with the Government's priorities for the agri-food sector.</p><p>  I am delighted that we agreed a new Accelerated Capital Allowance for Slurry Storage. This will drive further investments in slurry storage and management, consequently improving water quality, facilitating nutrient-use efficiency that reduces dependence on expensive artificial fertilisers, and reducing emissions. This measure is a strong signal of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting farmers in improving environmental sustainability.</p><p>  We also agreed on the renewal of vital tax reliefs including Stamp Duty Relief for Young-Trained Farmers and Stock Relief for Young-Trained Farmers and Registered Farm Partnerships. Generational renewal is critical to the future of the agri-food sector and national taxation measures, together with the support available under the CAP, represent a substantial commitment to young farmers. The renewal of Capital Gains Tax Relief for Farm Restructuring and Stamp Duty Relief for Farm Consolidation encourage the consolidation of farm holdings, reducing fragmentation and improving the operation and viability of farms. </p><p>  The Government has provided welcome supports in response to the current cost of living crisis. The Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme will provide important support to businesses including farmers and food businesses. The continuation of the reduction of excise duty on agricultural diesel to nil will also help alleviate costs for the sector.</p></reply>

The term &ldquo;good forestry practice&rdquo; is also defined in that section of the Act as including forestry practice that respects the principle that the diverse activities constituting forestry (including afforestation) must be planned and implemented in a manner that prevents, limits, abates or reduces significant adverse impacts or risks thereof on the character of the landscape. </p>  <p>  The use of ground vegetation to assess the suitability of land is a long-established method of assessing the suitability of sites for afforestation and as an aid to tree species selection. The evaluation of site productivity, by using a method that includes giving existing vegetation on site combined Reaction plus Nitrogen (R+N) values is part of the assessment my Department undertakes on applications.  This assessment also gives an indication whether fertiliser may be required for successful tree establishment, with higher R+N scores less likely to require fertiliser.  Depending on the site a more detailed assessment may be required.</p>  <p>  In the absence of details for any particular application it is not possible to elaborate further.  </p>  <p>  All licence decisions may be appealed to the Forestry Appeals Committee. </p></reply>

The Trade Coordination Agreement between the EU and the UK has played a significant role in mitigating new risks, although the Irish agri food sector is still exposed to any changes the UK might make in its international trading arrangements on its import controls. </p>  <p>  The strategic objectives for both the dairy and beef sectors are informed by Food Vision 2030 and in further detail by the environmental plans being prepared at present by the Food Vision Dairy and Beef Groups. Genotyping the national herd is being considered in this context. All potential avenues and funding mechanisms will be explored to meet the strategic objectives for the dairy and beef sectors for 2023 and beyond. </p></reply>

I met with representative groups from the industry in July and again in September to discuss this matter and provide them with a progress report on the schemes being developed to support the fishing fleet and wider seafood sector. These schemes, developed in line with the recommendations of the &ldquo;Report of the Seafood Task Force - Navigating Change&rdquo;, deal with the wider challenges in the fishing and seafood sector.</p>  <p>  In May, I introduced the 2022 temporary tie-up scheme which was expanded, compared to a similar scheme implemented in 2021, to account for the additional challenges fishers are facing. The &euro;24 million 2022 scheme allows vessel owners, if they wish, choose to tie-up for up to two calendar months. This is the largest such voluntary tie-up scheme ever run in Ireland with vessels receiving up to &euro;88,000 per month to tie up under the scheme. This tie-up opportunity frees up additional quota for those vessels continuing to fish, improving vessel returns and supporting viability in the wider fleet and enables the opportunity to fish until the end of the year.</p>  <p>  I have worked very closely with industry to develop short and longer term supports to assist the wider seafood industry cope with the consequences of Brexit and the wider operating environment. Since the publication of the Task Force Report, &euro;225m in supports and developmental strategies have been launched. These are more generous and comprehensive that those put in place elsewhere and will enable our seafood sector and coastal communities to overcome the significant challenges it faces.</p>  <p>  In relation to fuel prices, I will continue to monitor and assess the situation over the coming period and keep all available options under active consideration. </p></reply>

The granting of the aid was subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132.</p>  <p>  Just over 33,000 participants, including the person named, joined the scheme and, in doing so, gave a commitment to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on the holding by 5% for the reduction period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared with the reference period of 1st July 2018 to 30th June 2019 as recorded on the Department's AIM system.</p>  <p>  In light of the difficulties some farmers were experiencing in meeting this reduction arising from COVID-19 Government Public Health restrictions, I secured an alternative reduction period of 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021 over which farmers could choose to meet their 5% reduction commitment if they applied for this option online between 19th March 2021 and 21st June 2021. Some 16,000 BEAM participants opted for the alternative reduction period including the person named.</p>  <p>  Following the end of that alternative reduction period, my Department undertook a series of administrative and compliance checks to ensure that the commitments farmers had entered into under the BEAM Terms and Conditions had been met.</p>  <p>  In the case of the person named, the commitment to reduce the bovine livestock manure nitrogen by 5% was not met and, as a result, all BEAM monies received were to be recouped.</p>  <p>  The person named was informed of this decision by letter which also advised him of his right to request a review of the decision if they so wished. The person named contacted my Department to request a review of the decision and a decision on that review issued to them on 29 September 2022, upholding my Department's original decision and advising them of their right to appeal the outcome to the Agriculture Appeals Office if they so wished.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, TB breakdowns are difficult for farmers and farm families and the TB programme aims to minimise the impact of TB on farm families. </p>  <p>  The current herd incidence for bovine TB in Roscommon is 2.32% as compared to the National herd incidence of 4.14%. For 2021 the annual herd incidence was 2.81% in Roscommon as compared to the national 4.33%. This was the third lowest TB incidence in the country.  The herd incidence in Roscommon has fallen from 4.65% to 2.81% in the last 10 years despite herd size increasing over the same period. The primary routes of introduction or persistence of infection in herds are from spread within the herd from previous breakdowns, spread from wildlife or spread through animal movements. These are primarily addressed through herd restrictions, enhanced use of novel blood tests such as gamma interferon, implementation of the wildlife programme and trace animal testing.</p>  <p>  The combined efforts of all stakeholders in the TB programme in Roscommon is making an effective contribution towards the continued reduction in TB levels in Roscommon.</p></reply>

The context for this decision is provide additional quay side and greater depth to accommodate larger fishing vessels, and attract additional landings from both Irish and non-Irish fishing vessels. Since then, detailed design has been procured and a tender competition to deliver the works is underway. The full costs and timeline of the project will not be known until that tender competition closes and a successful bidder is contracted. My Department is working hard to ensure that the project is delivered within the timeframe of the existing planning permission.</p></reply>
