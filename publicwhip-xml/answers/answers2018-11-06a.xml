We then met in Article 50 format, where Michel Barnier provided an update on negotiations since the Informal Summit in Salzburg.</p><p>I reiterated the need to ensure that a legally robust backstop is agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and that this must apply unless and until it is replaced by alternative arrangements that make it no longer necessary. I thanked partners for their ongoing strong solidarity on this issue.</p><p>We agreed that not enough progress had been achieved in the negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement. We reiterated our readiness to convene a European Council, if and when Michel Barnier reports that decisive progress has been made and called on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement in accordance with previously agreed European Council guidelines.</p><p>On 18 October, the European Council exchanged views on migration, particularly the external aspects of migration; and on internal security, where our focus was on cyber-security.

The NTA&rsquo;s recent Bus &amp;amp; Rail Statistics bulletin shows over 250 million passenger journeys were provided nationally last year on public obligation services provided by the transport operators. </p><p>I welcome these increases, and I have no doubt the Deputy does too, as we all want more people to use public transport and/or active travel in terms of how they make journeys to work, school or leisure.</p><p>But obviously increased passenger numbers presents challenges in terms of ensuring appropriate levels of service and infrastructure to deal with the increases.</p><p>And we are working to ensure those appropriate levels of service and infrastructure and I am supporting those efforts through the increases in funding I have secured in successive Budgets. </p><p>There have been some notable additions to the public transport landscape in Dublin in recent years &ndash; </p><p>- We&rsquo;ve increased rail capacity and services by re-opening the Phoenix Park Tunnel to commuter services;</p><p>- We&rsquo;ve opened the new Luas CrossCity last December which has added around 10 million passenger journeys to the network;</p><p>- We&rsquo;ve expanded the PSO bus fleet by around 17% in recent years which means more capacity and more services for passengers;</p><p>- We&rsquo;ve introduced 10-minute DART services which has again increased services across the network.</p><p>In the coming months we will see further improvements to DART services through some service adjustments and the elimination of 4-car train sets during peak time, while we&rsquo;ll also see enhanced off-peak services on the Kildare, Northern and Maynooth lines. </p><p>So there have been improvements and those improvements have been welcomed by the travelling public as evidenced by the numbers using them.</p><p>But I know we need to continue to improve so that&rsquo;s why the increased funding I have secured for the period 2018 to 2021 will see further improvements as outlined in the NDP.</p><p>Those improvements include &ndash; </p><p>- The procurement of additional rail fleet in the short term, with the potential for acquiring second-hand rail fleet either through lease or purchase currently being explored;</p><p>- The provision of both extended and new trams on the Luas network;</p><p>- The continued renewal and expansion of the bus fleet under BusConnects; </p><p>- The provision of next generation bus corridors under BusConnects;</p><p>- The significant expansion of the rail fleet in the medium term as part of the DART Expansion programme, with a procurement notice to issue by year end; and</p><p>- The continued development of MetroLink, with construction expected to start in 2021.</p><p>In addition there have been increases already announced to services across the Dublin Bus network with more expected in the coming months which will result in significantly improved frequencies across 25 routes on the Company&rsquo;s network. </p><p>As the Deputy can see, there are a number of immediate, short, medium and longer-term measures underway which are designed to design with the increased numbers of passengers availing of our public transport network. </p><p>These measures are underpinned by the significantly improved funding I have secured in recent Budgets as reflected in the &euro;8.6billion allocated to public transport under the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600060#WRC00800"><p>The transit of foreign military forces through Irish airspace and airports is a longstanding practice, which began shortly after the Second World War. The vast majority of these movements of military forces have been to and from the United States. </p>  <p>  Successive Irish Governments have maintained this practice and these facilities have never been withdrawn or suspended during many different periods of international conflict. Similarly, successive Governments have deemed this to be compatible with Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality, which is defined as non-participation in military alliances.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport my functions in relation to the use of Shannon Airport and Irish airspace by the US military are limited. </p>  <p>  Questions relating to Irish foreign policy, Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality, the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na etc. are not matters which I can comment on in detail. Similarly I have no role in relation to flights by military or state aircraft through Irish airspace or landing at Irish airports. Such flights require the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952. </p>  <p>  A clear distinction is made in international and national law between military aviation and civil aviation. I am responsible for matters relating to Irish civil aviation legislation and policy. </p>  <p>  The 1944 Chicago Convention is the main international treaty governing the operation of civil aviation. Article 35 of the Convention states that no civil aircraft may carry munitions of war over a state without that state&rsquo;s permission. This requirement is ratified in Irish law in the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973, as amended. Under the 1973 Order the carriage of weapons and munitions of war is prohibited in any civil aircraft in Irish airspace and on board any Irish registered aircraft, unless an exemption is granted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Chicago Convention and the 1973 Order apply to munitions of war only, not to military personnel that may be on board civil aircraft.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Order, my Department operates a procedure under which airlines wishing to carry weapons or munitions through Irish airspace or airports must apply for each individual flight at least 48 hours in advance. My Department seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to foreign policy issues and the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to security issues. </p>  <p>  An internal review of these procedures is nearing completion. </p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting, that as Minister, in 2016, I used my discretion to refuse several applications. The department&rsquo;s recommendation was to grant the permits, having received no objections to the application during the consultation process. In these cases I used my discretionary powers to refuse these applications. Previous Ministers have rarely, if ever, used their discretion to refuse applications in circumstances where the relevant Departments and the IAA were recommending that an exemption be granted. These applications related to the transport of munitions of war,  categorised as dangerous goods i.e. munitions of war that contain material that is explosive, corrosive, flammable, toxic etc. Since I used my discretionary powers in 2016 to refuse these cases, very few (if any) applications have subsequently been received by the air operator concerned in respect of this category of munitions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600060#WRC01200"><p>As<i></i>I have indicated before, the Attorney General has raised issues in relation to the proposed legislation on a minimum passing distance.  Currently, my Department is engaging with the Attorney General's Office with a view to implementing alternative solutions which are legally robust.  I expect this legislation to be in place before the end of the year.</p><p>As to other initiatives, I am happy to have the chance to remind the Deputy that we are investing a great deal in cycling infrastructure and in cycling safety.This covers a wide range of projects including new segregated cycle lanes under the BusConnects programme, further separate funding for cycling as well as walking facilities, and additional funding for Greenways projects.  Furthermore, we are investing in safety infrastructure at 40 key junctions in Dublin. </p><p>We will continue to expand our 'Cycle Right' schools cycle safety programme, with 5,000 additional children expected to take part in 2019, while also undertaking further programmes to promote cycling activity and cycling safety.  </p><p>As the Deputy has mentioned the forthcoming Velo-City conference in Dublin in June next year, I am pleased to note that  Mario Deslandes, organiser of the Velo-City series on behalf of the European Cyclists' Federation, said of the choice of Dublin as a venue that &quot;Dublin is a great example of a city moving towards a more liveable, safe, and active environment for its citizens.&quot;  </p><p>I hope that the Deputy will join me in welcoming this positive affirmation of the great work which has been done by all stakeholders in promoting cycling and cycling safety in Ireland, contrary to the sometimes alarmist claims made in public about cycle safety in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600060#WRC01500"><p>In my reply to a similar question by the Deputy in September, I informed the Deputy that the study had taken longer than originally anticipated, as it has proven more complex than initially envisaged, and that it was being finalised with the intention of publishing in the coming weeks.  I am informed that the study is now finalised, is at the printers and will be published by the IMDO before the end of this week.  </p>  <p>  This is a very important study as the landbridge is our fastest shipping route to continental Europe and as such is heavily relied upon for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agrifood and perishable goods sector, as well as for just-in-time and high value goods. Any delays or barriers to this route to European and other markets could potentially be detrimental for certain sectors. This is a significant area of uncertainty for Ireland that could have a major impact on the capacity and efficiency of trade routes to the continent.</p>  <p>  Shipping companies are already making provision for larger vessels with extra capacity on direct routes to continental Europe and we have seen new routes emerging, such as Cork - Santander. However, the UK is and will continue to be a key trading partner for us and we need to minimise any potential disruption to UK trade at our ports and we need to ensure that we can continue to use the landbridge as a route to other markets.</p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste has highlighted previously, the Government&rsquo;s contingency planning for Brexit has from the start included the use of the landbridge and how we can continue to use this after the UK has left the EU. In addition to the IMDO&rsquo;s study, we are working on this matter with our colleagues across all relevant Government Departments, led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and including the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Marine, Department of Health, and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  Work on is being taken forward in two strands. The first is through the Article 50 negotiations. In the mandate provided to the European Commission by the EU27 in May 2017, it was agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement will take account of Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including the transit of goods (to and from Ireland via the UK). The need to address this issue as part of the distinct strand of the negotiations on Irish specific issues was agreed between the EU and the UK in the Joint Progress report of December 2017.</p>  <p>  The second strand is Ireland&rsquo;s work with the European Commission and other affected Member States (namely Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to examining the potential of EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code. This work is intensifying and good progress is being made.</p>  <p>  As with all relevant Government Departments and agencies, my Department is continuing its contingency planning for Brexit, both for an orderly and a disorderly Brexit.  In order to mitigate the risks arising for transport and tourism, we are working with our agencies, our colleagues across Government and with the European Commission.  </p>  <p>  Of course, our work on the landbridge also includes preparing for the possibility of a no-deal outcome. All relevant Departments are engaged in planning for a disorderly UK exit from the EU, and the Government has already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focused on East-West trade which will also take account of the continued use of the landbridge. We are working closely with our main ports and airports and with the OPW, the Revenue Commissioners, the Departments of Agriculture and Health, and other agencies, in planning the necessary State facilities that will be required in our main ports and airports following Brexit.</p></reply>

In that context, my Department is currently working on a Road Traffic Bill to provide, in the main, for graduated penalties for speeding offences. </p>  <p>  While not a priority at this time, the consolidation of the Road Traffic Acts must not simply be a matter of re-enacting all current road traffic legislation into one instrument.  The benefits of consolidation are too often misunderstood and over-stated. If the project is to be of value, it will be necessary to examine each aspect of the legislation and see where it might be improved upon.  Such a project, done properly, could take up to three years to complete.</p>  <p>  There is no indication of any failure of prosecutions due to a lack of consolidation, never mind the significant problem which would need to exist to justify diverting resources from more urgent tasks to consolidation at this time.  Any decision to undertake such a project in the future will have to be balanced against the value added and the risks associated with undermining the extensive legal precedents established to date. Indeed, I understand that recent significant precedents in court decisions would suggest that consolidation should not be undertaken at this time.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the Law Reform Commission has a consolidated text of each of the Road Traffic Acts from 1961 to 2014 available on its website, which along at least one recent publication of a consolidated text of the Road Traffic Acts and related Acts, delivers on what many understand consolidation to mean.</p></reply>

There is no proposal to change the long-standing Government policy of permitting aircraft used by the defence forces of various nations to transit through Irish airspace and airports, subject to appropriate terms and conditions.</p>  <p>  The review is focussing on the administrative and legislative functioning of the procedures and systems currently in place. </p>  <p>  In conducting the review my Department has consulted with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality and Defence on munitions of war issues and with the Irish Aviation Authority,  with regard to the carriage of dangerous goods.</p>  <p>  The Chicago Convention, which is the main international treaty governing the operation of civil aviation, states that no civil aircraft may carry munitions of war over a state without that state&rsquo;s permission. This requirement is ratified in Irish law by the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Orders, 1973 and 1989. Under the terms of these Orders the carriage of weapons and munitions of war is prohibited on any civil aircraft in Irish airspace and on board any Irish registered aircraft, unless an exemption is granted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  My Department operates a well-established procedure under which airlines wishing to carry munitions of war through Irish sovereign airspace, to Irish airports or on Irish registered aircraft must apply for each flight at least 48 hours in advance. My Department seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to foreign policy issues and the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to security issues. The IAA is consulted in relation to aviation safety issues for applications involving munitions of war that are also categorised as dangerous goods. If any of these bodies objects, an exemption will generally not be granted.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish this review once finalised.</p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting, that as Minister, in 2016, I used my discretion to refuse several applications. The department&rsquo;s recommendation was to grant the permits, having received no objections to the application during the consultation process. In these cases I used my discretionary powers to refuse these applications. Previous Ministers have rarely, if ever, used their discretion to refuse applications in circumstances where the relevant Departments and the IAA were recommending that an exemption be granted. These applications related to the transport of munitions of war,  categorised as dangerous goods i.e. munitions of war that contain material that is explosive, corrosive, flammable, toxic etc. Since I used my discretionary powers in 2016 to refuse these cases, very few (if any) applications have subsequently been received by the air operator concerned in respect of this category of munitions.</p></reply>

It is clear therefore, that the bus is the main component of the planned approach to addressing our current congestion problem and to meeting our future transport needs. </p><p>BusConnects has been developed to do just that and will see</p><p>- The introduction of next-generation bus corridors and Bus Rapid Transit routes;</p><p>- A redesign of bus network across the city;</p><p>- A new state-of-the-art ticketing system with a cashless payments and a simpler fare structure;</p><p>- The roll-out of new bus-stops with better signage and information;</p><p>- The provision of new park and ride sites;</p><p>- Cleaner technology through ending the purchase of diesel only buses; and</p><p>- A new integrated bus livery across the network.</p><p>Each of these measures are important in their own right while collectively they have the potential to significantly improve people&rsquo;s passenger experience. </p><p>In terms of the Bus Network Redesign, we are all aware of the significant public consultation that has taken place in recent months. There was a huge response to that consultation and the NTA are currently considering all submissions received with a view to issuing a revised network design for public consultation in 2019. </p><p>In relation to the Bus Corridors project, I am advised that the NTA will commence a public consultation process this month. It is proposed to that the consultation process in relation to these Bus Corridors will be conducted on a phased basis to allow for in-depth engagement with communities during each public consultation. </p><p>However, the improvement and enhancement of our PSO bus services continues in advance of those significant projects. </p><p>There are significant PSO bus fleet purchases planned for this year and next, with 165 buses to be delivered this year and 150 on order for next year. The bus purchase programme both renews the fleet through replacing older buses and improving passenger experience and also expands the fleet through the provision of additional buses. The level of expansion can be gauged by the fact that around 85 buses each year are required for renewal with deliveries above that effectively representing additional buses. The Deputy may wish to note that in recent years the PSO bus fleet in Dublin has expanded by approximately 17% and now stands at 1,125 buses.</p></reply>

The formal Bill is being finalised and I expect to be able to present it to this House this month. I look forward to the support of Deputies when it is presented.</p>  <p>  As part of the drafting process my officials have been in close contact with officials from Fingal County Council. I understand that this interaction has been very valuable in shaping the final form of the Bill.  The Government made a decision that Fingal County Council shall be the Competent Authority for the purpose of EU Regulation 598/2014.  This Government decision was based on an assessment that Fingal County Council represented the best available option for the effective implementation of the Airport Noise Regulation, given that there is significant amount of focus on the interaction between EU Regulation 598/2014, the 2002 Environmental Noise Directive and the planning and development framework.  It therefore continues to make sense for Fingal County Council to be appointed to undertake this role in order to ensure a fair and consistent approach to the assessment of development and the impact of aircraft noise at Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that the EU Regulation requires full public consultation before the Competent Authority makes a final decision about noise-related operating measures or restrictions at the airport, and we are working to make sure that the Bill will afford all stakeholders the opportunity to express their views.  The Bill will also provide for an independent appeals process, with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be appointed as the Appeals Body. </p></reply>

However, under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design, construction and development stages of individual road projects is a matter for</p><p>(a) the relevant road authority (i.e. local authorities in whose functional area a road development is situated) in relation to local and regional roads, or</p><p>(b) Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, in relation to national roads.</p><p>Overview</p><p>Consequently, it is an operational matter for a road authority and TII to give an account of how a project is progressing within their functional areas of responsibility.  However, having consulted with the relevant authorities, I can provide the following information and update to the Deputy on the Bonagee Link Road project, also referred to as the Letterkenny Inner Relief Road.</p><p>- In Co. Donegal the Trans European Network-Transport (TEN&ndash;T) Comprehensive road network runs from the Leitrim County Boundary in the South of the County (on the outskirts of Bundoran) to the Northern Ireland Border with Derry in the Northeast of the County at Bridgend (on the outskirts of Derry City) and involves Sections of the N13, N14 and N15.</p><p>- In 2016 Donegal County Council commissioned a Corridor Needs Study on the TEN-T Comprehensive network within Donegal.  The study identified projects in Donegal necessary to improve the TEN-T Comprehensive network to the required standard in compliance with the TEN- T regulations.  The outcome of the Study identified a priority list of schemes.  It recommended three projects for immediate advancement through Phases 1 to 4 of the Project Management Guidelines.</p><p>- N15/N13 Ballybofey - Stranorlar Bypass</p><p>- N56/N13/N14 - Letterkenny Bypass and Letterkenny to Manorcunningham Dual Carriageway</p><p>- N14 Manorcunningham to Lifford Realignment Scheme including the N14/N15 link to the A5 Western Transport Corridor in Northern Ireland</p><p>The Bonagee Link Road, or the Letterkenny Inner Relief Road, forms part of the proposed N56/N13/N14 scheme.  </p><p>Transport Infrastructure  Ireland  (TII) has provided an allocation of &euro;2.4m in 2018 to Donegal County Council to progress planning work on priority national road improvements projects that were identified in the 2016 needs study report on the TEN-T Comprehensive Network in County Donegal, as I have just mentioned.</p><p>These projects are identified as Strategic Investment Priorities in the National Planning Framework (NPF) and National Development Plan (NDP)</p><p>Current Status</p><p>Feasibility Studies for the priority schemes commenced in 2017 and the route selection process is on-going.  Public consultations of identified route options for all these priority schemes were held in April and May this year in Letterkenny, Lifford and Ballybofey.The short-listed route corridors are now being analysed and the emerging preferred routes will be identified towards the end of this year.Donegal County Council anticipates that the preferred route will be identified and presented to the public in early 2019.</p><p>Funding</p><p>The total cost of these schemes would be of the order of &euro;400 million.</p><p>Timetable</p><p>The expected construction timetable for all three schemes, identified as priority in the TEN-T Study, would be approximately three years. However there is no timeframe for completing the schemes at present as they would need to obtain both Business Case approval and Planning Consent and will be subject to the availability of funding in the future.</p></reply>

These measures have included the allocation of additional security and supervisory operatives, particularly at night and in certain areas, as well as more resources for centralised CCTV monitoring stations. The company also emphasised that it works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on anti-social behaviour in general and receives the full support of the Garda&iacute;. </p>  <p>  More recently, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that security and supervisory operatives have been allocated, particularly at night, in certain areas and at sensitive times, such as last week&rsquo;s mid-term break, Halloween and the forthcoming late-night Christmas services.</p>  <p>  In addition, I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has now commenced the deployment of on-board customer-service officers on intercity trains. While the primary focus will be on customer service, their presence is intended to deter anti-social behaviour and will enable rapid contact with security and/or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should this be required.</p>  <p>  The RSAC, in its response, recommended the establishment of a dedicated unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police our rail network on occasions when the possibility of anti-social behaviour is high. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus were also contacted for their views and both companies responded that the level of anti-social behaviour is relatively low and noted a declining trend which is very positive. Both companies also stressed the strong and close working relationships with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  Following engagement with the public transport companies and the RSAC, I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality to seek his views as to how we might best address the issue of anti-social behaviour on our transport system, in particular on the Irish Rail network.  </p>  <p>  I have asked that the Minister consider this issue in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, given that the allocation of all Garda resources, including the manner in which Garda personnel are deployed, is solely a decision for the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  I will continue to work with the Minister for Justice on this important issue.</p></reply>

Under the 2017 round of the programme &euro;62m was allocated to 1,837 sporting projects and my officials continue to assist these grantees in completing their projects and draw down their grants. </p>  <p>  Sanction was received earlier this year from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to open a new round of the Programme with allocations of up to &euro;40m.  This new round opened for applications on Friday 7 September and the application period closed on Friday 19th October.  By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding.  While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it will be at least the second quarter of next year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced.   Sufficient resources are available next year to cover all existing commitments under the programme in addition to the new allocations of &euro;40m. </p>  <p>  With regard to swimming pools, the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP), as operated by my Department, provides grant aid to local authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. To date 51 pools have been completed and four swimming pool projects remain in the current LASPP. The priority next year will be on advancing these four projects and sufficient resources are available to cover these commitments. </p>  <p>  In relation to the future funding of swimming pools and other larger projects, the National Development Plan confirmed the establishment of a new Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). It is intended that the Fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount currently available for individual projects under the SCP. The fund will initially focus on the National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities. The detailed terms and conditions of the new scheme are currently being finalised in my Department and an announcement in relation to when applications will be accepted will be made shortly.</p></reply>

The Council&rsquo;s application was made in its role as the relevant local and roads authority for Dublin City and I am sure the Deputy respects the role of the City Council, and indeed all local authorities, in relation to their statutory roles and responsibilities. </p><p>The Deputy refers to the development of a plaza on College Green which of course forms a central element of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s plans for the area and features in the Council&rsquo;s Development Plan.</p><p>There is of course a transport element to the Council&rsquo;s plans for College Green and that was founded on part of the 2015 &ldquo;Dublin City Centre Transport Study&rdquo;, which was developed by the Council in partnership with the National Transport Authority (NTA).  That Transport Study sought to</p><p>- Address the transport issues facing the core city centre area;</p><p>- Facilitate the implementation of the Council&rsquo;s Development Plan; and </p><p>- Safeguard the future development of the city.</p><p>The Study noted that the development of Luas CrossCity required a renewed focus on traffic and junction arrangements along its route, including the College Green area. </p><p>Complementing that focus, the Council sought to improve the public realm and create a new civic plaza. As I have already mentioned, I understand that the proposal to upgrade the public realm forms part of the Council&rsquo;s current Development Plan.</p><p>As the Deputy can appreciate, therefore, the planning application for the College Green plaza proposal is a matter for the Council. </p><p>However, as I have said there is a transport context for this.</p><p>The issue of congestion is one which formed the backdrop to the 2015 Study and forms the backdrop to any discussion of transport within the core City Centre today also.</p><p>As we all know the College Green area is an important transport corridor for public transport and pedestrians and cyclists too.</p><p>The implications of the Board&rsquo;s recent decision are being carefully considered by the Council in its role as relevant local and roads authority for the area, and the National Transport Authority, in its statutory role as transport authority.</p><p>That consideration reflects the statutory responsibilities of the various State authorities. It is not a matter for decision by a Government Minister as to what the traffic arrangements on a City Centre street might be or whether a public plaza should be created or indeed how it should be created.</p><p>What I am responsible for is the development of public transport policy and the overall funding to provide for the implementation of that policy. </p><p>And in that regard we have made progress in recent years since publication of the City Centre Transport Study in 2015</p><p>- We&rsquo;ve increased rail services through the re-opening of the Phoenix Park Tunnel;</p><p>- We&rsquo;ve continued to invest in the City Centre Re-signalling Project;</p><p>- We&rsquo;ve introduced 10-minute DART services;</p><p>- We&rsquo;ve invested in new bus services and fleet; and</p><p>- We&rsquo;ve invested in improved cycle routes and expanded public bike sharing schemes.</p><p>And we&rsquo;re planning for the future too, through the BusConnects, MetroLink and DART Expansion projects.</p><p>So there has been progress in public transport in recent years and that progress will continue and accelerate with the roll-out of those projects I&rsquo;ve just referred to. </p><p>In relation to the specific issues in the College Green area, I expect the Council and the NTA will fully consider the Board&rsquo;s recent decision in the context of the known issues which remain with regard to the movement of transport through the area.</p></reply>

While this planning is necessary, the Government remains focused on work in the negotiations to conclude a withdrawal agreement. Contingency planning for a no-deal outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by all Departments on issues within their policy remit, was identified as an early priority and is now well advanced. </p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in extensive contingency planning in relation to Brexit. The European Commission is also engaged in preparing for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU and Ireland is liaising closely with the Commission on such matters and strongly favours an EU level solution in the area of aviation. My Department is actively engaging with the European Commission Taskforce and the Brexit Preparedness Unit on these, and related issues.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this work on contingency planning, officials from my Department continue to consult and engage with other Government Departments, key Aviation stakeholders, including the Irish Aviation Authority, and other relevant authorities, via the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, and other fora, on all aviation matters relating to Brexit planning. </p>  <p>  The Department has continually stressed the importance that aviation stakeholders take all necessary steps to prepare for Brexit, including the importance of undertaking contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations. We have also advised stakeholders to refer to the European Commission&rsquo;s published Notices to Stakeholders in the field of air transport, aviation safety and aviation security. </p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that its approach to preparing for Brexit is aimed at minimising the impact of Brexit on our trade and economy and an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU. This is certainly the case in aviation, given the importance of the sector for Ireland and the fact that the UK is by far the most important origin and destination for aviation traffic in and out of Ireland.</p></reply>

An efficient public transport sector is a key priority in meeting our climate change goals. Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to providing an alternative to the private car not only to reduce congestion and emissions but also to enable the transport sector to cater, in an environmentally sustainable way, for the increasing demand associated with growing population and employment. </p>  <p>  One of the primary objectives of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) Programme is to encourage modal shift and public transport use through higher service provision and lower fares.  I have secured an aggregate funding increase of over 36% in PSO funding in the last three years.  In Budget 2019, I have secured further additional funding which means I will be providing &euro;287m to the NTA for PSO funding in 2019. </p>  <p>  In addition to effecting modal shift, we are seeking to address climate emissions by encouraging a transition away from fossil fuels.  I have outlined my ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland would be zero-emission capable. To support this ambition and a Programme for Partnership Government commitment, an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Taskforce was jointly convened by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  </p>  <p>  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme also plays a major role in decarbonising the road transport sector in Ireland.  The penetration of biofuels as a share of road transport energy has increased significantly over recent years from a share of 4 % in 2010 to 8% (by volume) from 2017.  It is intended that the biofuel obligation scheme will be incrementally increased on a sustainable basis over the next two years.</p>  <p>  Finally, an important role will be played by more efficient standards for vehicles.  Ireland continues to push strongly for better EU vehicles standards, seeking greater ambition in regulations that ensure vehicles registered in Europe are increasingly more efficient and less emitting.  It is through better technology and improved efficiency that carbon emissions generated by vehicles can be decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth.</p></reply>

In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the total length of the regional and local road network within the area of responsibility of the relevant local authority.  </p></reply>

To address this challenge, emission reductions and energy efficiencies are being strongly pursued through four main channels.</p><p>Firstly, we are increasing investment in the public and sustainable transport to support modal shift and accommodate growing travel demand.  An efficient public transport sector is a key priority in meeting our climate change goals.  The NDP has committed &euro;8.6 billion to public transport over the next 10 years to 2027.  Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to providing an alternative to the private car:  not only to reduce congestion and emissions but also to enable the transport sector to cater, in an environmentally sustainable way, for the increasing demands associated with growing population and employment.  Major projects planned include: BusConnects, which will transform the bus network in our cities with new and expanded bus routes, greatly improved bus access, designated segregated cycle lanes and park and ride facilities; investment in the DART Expansion Programme; and the MetroLink.  We also have multi-annual urban Cycling and Walking Infrastructure investment underway for our main cities. </p><p>Secondly, we are encouraging a transition away from fossil fuels.  In the 'National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland<i>' </i>I firmly outlined my ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland would be zero-emission capable. To support this ambition and a Programme for Partnership Government commitment, an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Taskforce was jointly convened by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Phase 1 of the Taskforce considered a range of measures and options to accelerate the deployment of EVs.  Arising from their recommendations further generous incentives for EVs were announced as part of Budgets 2018 and 2019 aimed at assisting all drivers in purchasing hybrid or electric cars, including significant toll reductions.  Phase 1 of the LEV Taskforce is now complete and the LEV Taskforce Progress Report is available on my Department's website.  Phase 2 has begun its work and will consider the options available to Government to support the deployment of other alternative fuels, namely natural gas, biomethane, hydrogen, and synthetic/paraffinic fuels, with a particular emphasis on the heavy duty vehicle sector.</p><p>Thirdly, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme plays a major role in decarbonising the road transport sector in Ireland.  The penetration of biofuels as a share of road transport energy has increased significantly over recent years from a share of 4 % in 2010 to 8% (by volume) from 2017.  It is intended that the biofuel obligation scheme will be incrementally increased on a sustainable basis to help meet the renewable transport target of 10% by 2020 as set under the Renewable Energy Directive. The obligation rate will increase to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019; and again to 11% by volume from 1 January 2020.</p><p>Finally, an important role will be played by more efficient standards for vehicles.  Ireland continues to push strongly for better EU vehicles standards, seeking greater ambition in regulations that ensure vehicles registered in Europe are increasingly more efficient and less emitting.  It is through better technology and improved efficiency that carbon emissions generated by vehicles can be decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth.</p></reply>

I am delighted that this Bill has been supported and I look forward to it progressing through the Houses.</p><p>Earlier this year I committed to examining what would be the best regulatory approach for rickshaws, as a result of the public safety concerns being raised. I tasked my Department with considering a range of options and engaging in consultation with a number of stakeholders regarding a new regulatory approach.  </p><p>My Bill will introduce comprehensive new detention powers which will ensure effective enforcement of a ban on motorised rickshaws carrying passengers for reward, since these are the faster vehicles which create the greater risks.  The Bill will also introduce a licensing regime for non-motorised rickshaws only.  These new measures will ensure that rickshaws drivers and vehicles are vetted and registered and I am confident that this will significantly improve safety for passengers and for all road users.  The new approach will also enhance customer experience and in turn help improve the ambiance in our city centres, bringing further benefits for tourism and local businesses. </p><p>It is my hope that this Bill can progress through the Houses without delay.</p></reply>

A concept paper was developed and some initial consultations took place with national and international third level and research institutes, as well as potential philanthropic contributors. Arising from this, it was decided to conduct a formal feasibility study. Following a tender process in 2017, a contract was awarded to a consultancy body to complete this study.

I have been informed by the military authorities that the HSA has formally noted the considerable progress made to date by the Defence Forces towards implementation of a safety management system for the control of hazardous substances.  Subject to completion of the improvement plan the HSA investigation is closed. However, it must be noted that in the Air Corps health and safety is a matter of ongoing monitoring, supervision and adjustment.</p>  <p>  I am considering the responses I received from the parties and legal advice in the context of ongoing active litigation before deciding on the next steps to be taken.</p></reply>

Tourism Ireland Ltd. is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I do not have direct responsibility for any of the North South Implementation Bodies or Tourism Ireland Ltd, or for allocations made to those Bodies.   The North South Implementation Bodies and Tourism Ireland, all of which operate on an all-island basis, are funded jointly by the Administrations, North and South, on the basis of an agreed contribution ratio, which varies from Body to Body, and decisions concerning the Bodies are taken jointly by the relevant Ministers North and South in the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).</p>  <p>  At present, in the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive, it is not possible for the NSMC to meet and to bring the Government and Executive together to oversee ongoing North South work and further develop cooperation, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.   Notwithstanding the current political situation, the North South Implementation Bodies continue to carry out their important public functions in line with their mandates and to deliver economic and social benefits for people across the island. </p>  <p>  Allocations to the Bodies are matters for the Ministers that I have listed, and full details of the allocations for 2019 will be set out in the Revised Estimates Volume.</p></reply>

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan TD, and I represented the Government.  The UK Government was represented by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, David Lidington MP, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP Set up under the Good Friday Agreement, the Conference brings together the Irish and UK Governments to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.  Following on from the most recent meeting of the BIIGC, in London on 25 July, last week&rsquo;s meeting provided the opportunity to continue our discussions on legacy issues, security co-operation, East-West matters, and political stability in Northern Ireland.    At the meeting, we reaffirmed our commitment to implementing the framework established in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement to comprehensively address the legacy of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s past, taking account of the UK Government&rsquo;s public consultation on establishing the legacy institutions. </p>  <p>  On security co-operation, both Governments recalled the commitments made in the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement to ending paramilitarism and welcomed the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC) established under that Agreement. In considering the findings and recommendations contained in the report, the Conference noted in particular the IRC&rsquo;s view that the full operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is essential to ending paramilitarism and achieving community transformation. </p>  <p>  The Conference discussed a joint paper by Irish and British officials which outlined a number of possible models to maintain and strengthen the high level of bilateral co-operation between the UK and Ireland post-Brexit.  Both Governments agreed that these new structures for systemic bilateral co-operation should demonstrate the strength and depth of the relationship, provide opportunities for ministers and officials to continue to engage with each other, and provide an overall architecture for cooperation that is both meaningful and sustainable in the future.  As announced following the Conference, this model would include top level summits involving Heads of Government and senior ministers and would alternate between Ireland and the UK.  These summits would be supported by close bilateral work by ministers.  Officials on both sides have been asked to turn these ideas into a detailed practical plan of work with a view to presenting a fully worked through proposal for future East-West cooperation for consideration at the next meeting of the Conference.</p>  <p>  The Conference provided both Governments the opportunity to reaffirm our strong support for the Good Friday and subsequent Agreements.  It was recognised that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have been essential for the progress made in Northern Ireland over the past two decades and that they remain the indispensable framework for the political process in Northern Ireland.  Both Governments reiterated their shared commitment to securing the operation of the devolved power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and the consequent resumption of meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  It was agreed that the BIIGC would reconvene in spring 2019.</p></reply>

The European Commission subsequently published a White Paper on the issue and followed it up with a series of Reflection Papers on EU finances, harnessing globalisation, defence, the social dimension and completion of economic and monetary union.</p>  <p>  In September 2017, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, launched the &lsquo;Leaders&rsquo; Agenda&rsquo;, an ambitious work programme running until the European Parliament elections in 2019 which puts the European Council at the heart of decision-making process. </p>  <p>The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, T.D., is actively engaged in the Leaders&rsquo; Agenda, which has so far dealt with issues such as education and culture, migration, Economic and Monetary Union, taxation, MFF, innovation and digital economy, and internal security.</p>  <p>Last November, I joined the Taoiseach and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Helen McEntee, T.D., in launching a Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the future of Europe.</p>  <p>The public were invited to contribute to the wider European debate by attending one of these events or making a submission online. Regional events were held in counties Galway, Meath, Cork and Donegal, as well as an NGO forum in Dublin. The series culminated in the National Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin, on Europe Day, 9 May last.</p>  <p>Last month my Department published a Report on the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogues. This will help to inform Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the wider debate which is expected to culminate in a special Informal Summit in Romania next May, where leaders will prepare the Strategic Agenda for 2019-2024.</p>  <p>In advance of this Summit, we will publish a statement of our strategic priorities for the European Union.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach discussed the issue with President Trump in the Oval Office last March and also in his meetings on Capitol Hill during this year&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit.  I have also prioritised this issue in my own engagements with the US Administration and Congress, and discussed it most recently with Congressman Richie Neal last week in Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has also been active on the issue and has, since his appointment, travelled to Washington, D.C., on eleven separate occasions for meetings with key contacts.</p>  <p>  In addition, our Embassy in Washington, D.C., continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the Administration and with a wide range of contacts on Capitol Hill. </p>  <p>  Through these many high-level contacts and discussions, the Government continues to explore a number of different options.  This remains a very challenging issue, however.  Immigration reform has been a sensitive and divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with an issue which directly affects over 11 million people, from many different countries of origin.  </p>  <p>  On the welfare of the undocumented Irish, the Embassy, as well as our six Consulates across the United States, work closely with Irish Immigration Centers, which support the needs of Irish citizens in the United States, including those who are undocumented.  These Centers all receive annual funding from the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme to support their important work. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that both the Taoiseach and I, together with our Government colleagues, Special Envoy Deputy Deasy, and our Embassy in Washington, D.C., will continue to give full priority to these issues.</p></reply>

The ultimate objective is to ensure better outcomes and understanding by all of a particular policy or legislative proposal. </p><p>In accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, my Department has produced five distinct Statements of Strategy over the past ten years (2008-2018). As part of the drafting process for each of these, external consultations with Government Departments and State Agencies were undertaken. Public consultations were also undertaken in the development of the Statement of Strategy in 2010, 2011 and 2016. </p><p>A Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid was undertaken in 2012 and was led by the Minister of State for Trade and Development. Public consultation took place between February and April 2012. Overall, over one thousand people were consulted during review and 165 written submissions were received. The Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group provided independent oversight for the Review. A new policy to guide Ireland&rsquo;s role in international development, &ldquo;<i>One World, One Future&rdquo;</i>, was launched in May 2013. </p><p>An extensive public consultation process was undertaken between November 2013 and February 2014 as part of the Foreign Policy Review 2015. The Foreign Policy Review was a broad-based examination of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and led to the publication of <i>&ldquo;The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing</i><i>World&rdquo;</i>. These consultations also fed into the Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2015-2017. </p><p>In October 2013, at the third Global Irish Economic Forum, the Government announced that a review of our diaspora policy would be undertaken; following which a consultation paper was launched on 18 March, 2014.  More than 130 written submissions were received. </p><p>On 24 June 2014, the Government decided to develop a National Plan for the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The coordinating role for developing the Plan was assigned to my Department which adopted an inclusive and collaborative approach to developing the Plan, working closely with Government Departments, State Agencies, business enterprises and civil society.  My Department&rsquo;s annual Civil Society Forum in that year was dedicated to the theme of &ldquo;<i>Business and Human Rights - Implementing the UN Guiding Principles</i>&rdquo;. This event was attended by approximately 250 civil society actors.</p><p>In February 2015, my Department initiated a public consultation which received over 30 submissions and hosted a workshop with business and civil society representatives to discuss priorities for the Plan. In January 2016, a consultation event was held in Iveagh House on the Working Outline of Ireland&rsquo;s National Plan on Business and Human Rights. Following an invitation for submissions based on the Working Outline, responses were received from civil society and the business community. The &ldquo;<i>National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights</i>&rdquo; was launched in November 2017.  </p><p>In 2015 in accordance with the Official Languages Act 2003 my Department drafted our second Irish language scheme. The scheme was drafted to comply with our obligations under the Act and to ensure better availability and a higher standard of public services through Irish. The Department invited submissions in relation to the preparation of the scheme from any interested parties. </p><p>In December 2017, I asked Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Berlin, Michael Collins, to undertake a comprehensive review of our relations with Germany. As part of the review, an extensive programme of consultations was undertaken with key stakeholders. Details of these consultations are set out in the published review, &ldquo;<i>Ireland in Germany: A Wider and Deeper Footprint</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>During the first half of 2018 my Department organised a series of Citizens&rsquo; Dialogues; engagement with key stakeholders and other events across the country focused on the Future of Europe. The public were invited to contribute to the wider European debate by attending one of these events or making a submission online. Regional events were held in counties Galway, Kildare, Cork, Donegal, as well as an NGO forum in Dublin. This culminated in the National Citizens&rsquo; Dialogue on the Future of Europe at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin on Europe Day, 9th May last. This event was hosted by Minister of State for European Affairs, Helen McEntee T.D. and myself, along with 250 members of the public and civil society representatives. </p><p>Last year I said that the Government would bring forward a new policy on international development, echoed in the Global Ireland document in which the Government committed to publishing a new White Paper on Ireland&rsquo;s International Development Cooperation. The intention is to publish the White Paper before the end of the year.</p><p>I launched a public consultation on the new international development policy on 12 July 2018.  This was on the basis of a public consultation document generated following a series of meetings with stakeholders across my Department and in other Government Departments, as well as a number of thematic workshops.  The public consultation concluded on 2 October 2018. Over 185 substantive written submissions were received from Irish people and non-governmental organisations, as well as UN and other international bodies. Another 14,000 emails expressing general support for the aid programme were received.  Five well-attended public meetings were held, in Cork, Galway, Sligo, Limerick, and Dublin.  </p><p>The submissions received as part of these various consultation processes are retained by the appropriate business units of my Department, with details of each process, and the resulting reports and outcomes published on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.dfat.ie or www.irishaid.ie, as appropriate. </p><p>There are no State agencies under the aegis of my Department.</p><p>The following table provides summary information on each of the consultations outlined:</p><p><table><tr><th>Date</th><th>Title/ Subject</th><th>Public</th><th>Government  Departments</th><th>Location</th></tr><tr><td>August 2010</td><td>Statement of Strategy 2011-2013</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td> <br /><br />DFAT / Website Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>July 2011</td><td>Statement of Strategy 2011-2014</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td> <br /><br />DFAT Website/ Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>November 2011</td><td>1st National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td> 2011 &ndash; 2014<br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>February 2012</td><td>Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td><br /><br />Irish Aid Website/ Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>December 2013</td><td>2015 Foreign Policy Review</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td><br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records </td></tr><tr><td>March 2014</td><td>Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Engagement with the Diaspora  </td><td>Yes </td><td>No</td><td><br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records  </td></tr><tr><td>December 2014</td><td>Statement of Strategy 2015-2017</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td><br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>January 2015</td><td>2nd National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security</td><td>Yes </td><td>No</td><td> 2015 &ndash; 2018<br /><br />DFAT Website/ Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>February 2015</td><td>Workshop on Business &amp;amp;  Human Rights</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td><br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>June 2015</td><td>Language Scheme in compliance with the Official Languages Act 2003</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>January 2016</td><td>Business &amp;amp; Human Rights Consultation Event</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td> <br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>October 2016</td><td>Statement of Strategy 2017-2019</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td> <br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>September 2017</td><td>Statement of Strategy 2016-2019</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td> <br /><br />DFAT Website/ Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>December 2017</td><td>Ireland in Germany &ndash; A Deeper &amp;amp; Wider Footprint</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td> <br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>Jan - May 2018</td><td>7 &ldquo;Future of Europe&rdquo; Consultation Events</td><td>Yes </td><td>No</td><td> <br /><br />DFAT Website/Internal DFAT Records</td></tr><tr><td>July &ndash; Oct 2018</td><td>Ireland's New White Paper on International Development</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>White paper to be published before end of 2018<br /><br />Internal DFAT Records </td></tr></table></p></reply>

After over three years of armed conflict, a stalled peace process and a severe economic decline which has accelerated the collapse of essential basic services and institutions, Yemen is in the grip of a large-scale, protracted humanitarian crisis. The UN reports that 17.8 million people are currently food insecure, including 8.4 million severely so &ndash; 24% more than in 2017. Critical public services in health, water and sanitation, and education are increasingly limited. The UN&rsquo;s Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande, has warned that as many as 13 million civilians are at risk if the fighting continues. Ireland joins our EU partners in urging all parties to cooperate in order to achieve a political resolution, respect international humanitarian law, and ensure unrestricted humanitarian access and the free flow of commercial goods.</p>  <p>  Ireland is doing what we can to address the devastating humanitarian situation and try and help alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people. Since 2015, Ireland has provided almost &euro;16.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen. This includes a contribution of &euro;4 million made to the UN Yemen Humanitarian Fund this year, which provides assistance in the areas of education, logistics, food security, nutrition and health.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides humanitarian support to Yemen through our contributions to EU funds. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the EU has contributed a total of &euro;438.2 million to Yemen, which includes humanitarian, development, stabilisation and resilience support.</p>  <p>  However, it is crucial that we also push for a resolution of the conflict which is the ultimate cause of the suffering of so many civilians. This has been one of my consistent messages to all parties to the conflict. Officers from my Department consistently convey the Government&rsquo;s strong concerns to the Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Iranian Embassies in Dublin. And I myself met with the Saudi Ambassador last month and stressed the importance that Ireland puts on this issue.</p>  <p>Ireland is looking to use our leverage in other multilateral fora to focus on the situation in Yemen. At the human Rights Council in September 2017 Ireland was part of a core group of countries which ensured the establishment of a Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen to investigate alleged violations of human rights and contraventions of international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict. In September of this year, Ireland worked to ensure the extension of the mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts for another year.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation at our meeting in June 2018 with the UN Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths. All were in agreement on the need to continue our strong support for the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to bring about a political solution to the conflict.  Since June the talks have stalled and Mr. Griffiths is making every effort to restart the negotiations. We continue to call on all parties to work towards a ceasefire, and engage constructively with the UN, and I expect that there will be further discussion on Yemen at the Foreign Affairs Council in the coming months.</p></reply>

She called for China to engage constructively with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>  This speech also noted that the EU had raised the situation in Xinjiang and at the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue which took place on 9-10 July had reiterated its request for fact-finding visits to Xinjiang.  This annual dialogue is the primary formal framework through which the EU engages in discussion in the field of human rights protection and promotion with China.  </p>  <p>  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, the situation in Xinjiang was raised at a bilateral level with Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, Mr Wang Chao, during his visit to Ireland last week when he undertook political consultations covering a wide range of issues of mutual interest.</p>  <p>  In addition to raising human rights concerns with the Chinese authorities at a bilateral level, these issues are also raised regularly in multilateral fora by both Ireland and the EU. In this context, the EU has raised concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang during the most recent session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2018, and during the current session of the UN General Assembly Third Committee on 26 October. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with a number of other Member States, have also raised the situation in Xinjiang during our contribution to China&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) which took place this morning in Geneva. The UPR is the mechanism through which the United Nations Human Rights Council examines and addresses the human rights performance of its member states. </p>  <p>  In addition to engaging with the Chinese authorities in Beijing on this issue, a number of EU diplomats have visited Xinjiang in recent months to ascertain the situation on the ground there. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government, together with our EU partners, will continue to raise human rights issues with China, in frequent and regular dialogue, through our contacts in both Dublin and Beijing, and through the relevant multilateral channels.</p></reply>

Building on work that was already underway across Government Departments and Agencies, the campaign aims to provide information to citizens on the current state of play in the negotiations and wider issues that may affect them as a result of Brexit, and to explain the extensive work underway across Government to prepare for Brexit, including information on the comprehensive range of financial and other supports that are available for business and other key affected sectors.</p>  <p>Information on all aspects of Brexit can be accessed on our revamped Brexit website (www.dfa.ie/brexit), bringing together information on the range of activities being carried out by the Government and its agencies in one accessible resource.  Visitors to the website can sign-up to the Government Brexit Update newsletter service, and dedicated social media channels have also been launched.  Since the re-launch in late September, the website has had over 17,000 visitors and the @BrexitReadyIRL Twitter account now has over 6,000 followers. </p>  <p>  As part of this campaign, the first phase in a series of whole-of-Government Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public outreach events have been held across the country in Cork (5 October), Galway (12 October), Monaghan (19 October) and Dublin (25 October).  Further events are planned for later this month.  With more than 2,000 attendees, these events showcased the extensive work of the Government&rsquo;s Departments and agencies, bringing together this experience and expertise in a &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; for citizens and businesses in particular.  The events provide an opportunity for interested individuals and businesses, including in the agrifood and tourism sectors, to access advice and information about Brexit preparedness and the range of support measures and resources the Government has put in place. </p>  <p>  The positive impact of the workshops is reflected through the increase in interactions with the Brexit supports offered by State Agencies. For example, Enterprise Ireland has recorded a 92% increase in Brexit Scorecard completions from September to October, as well as a 62% increase in interactions on its website. Similarly, F&aacute;ilte Ireland noted an 18% increase in views to their Brexit webpages subsequent to the October Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events. </p>  <p>  The Getting Ireland Brexit Ready campaign is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, working closely with other Government Departments. The logo design, advertisement, and creation of video content were outsourced to external agencies.  </p></reply>

The loans were made available through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, and SMEs applied directly to those banks to obtain approval for a loan through the banks&rsquo; usual credit processes.  The borrowers and loans were subject to eligibility criteria determined by the SBCI in accordance with its obligations to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to the European Investment Fund and in compliance with State Aid regulations.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme is currently available and can facilitate up to &euro;300m of lending to SMEs and Small MidCap enterprises.  For this scheme, borrowers may confirm their eligibility directly with the SBCI (details are available on the SBCI&rsquo;s website at www.sbci.gov.ie) and then proceed to apply for a loan through the financial intermediaries selected by the SBCI following an Open Call process, in this case AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  The borrowers and loans are subject to eligibility criteria determined by the SBCI in accordance with its obligations to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, to the European Investment Fund and in compliance with State Aid regulations.</p>  <p>  The SBCI also operates the Credit Guarantee Scheme on behalf of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and loans of &euro;28.7m to 190 SMEs have been supported under that scheme in the last two years.</p>  <p>  If the outcome of a banks internal appeals process is unsatisfactory to the customer they have the option of appealing to the Credit Review Office.  The Credit Review Office is a government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The CRO provides a confidential, independent review process and will engage with the lender that has refused or reduced credit, the Office overturns more than 50% of lenders decisions in the appeals it receives.</p></reply>

The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual, who does not have a minimum guaranteed pension income for life, has a capital nest-egg to provide for the later years of his or her retirement.</p><p>An AMRF automatically becomes an ARF when the owner either meets the guaranteed pension income requirement or attains the age of 75 years, and the amount of funds in the AMRF at that time can be drawn down at the owner&rsquo;s discretion under ARF rules. </p><p>The &euro;5 per week increase in all weekly social welfare payments announced in Budget 2019, which applies from next March, will be taken into account in determining if an AMRF owner meets the minimum guaranteed pension income necessary for the conversion of the AMRF into an ARF.  From 1 March 2019, the State Pension (Contributory) payable to an individual aged under 80 years, with 48 or more average yearly PRSI contributions, will be &euro;248.30 per week.  On an annualised basis this will exceed the &euro;12,700 income threshold mentioned above for an AMRF or annuity.  Individuals whose only pension income is the &ldquo;full&rdquo; State Pension (Contributory) will therefore not be subject to the AMRF requirement and may invest their full pension savings in an ARF.</p><p>Previously, the Christmas bonus paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was not counted towards the &euro;12,700 requirement because neither the payment nor the amount of the payment was guaranteed.  From March 2018, the amount of the State Pension (Contributory), where payable to individuals with 48 or more yearly average PRSI contributions, was only marginally less than &euro;12,700 (for individuals aged under 80 years, it was &euro;243.30 per week, an annualised total of &euro;12,651.60).  Given these circumstances, Revenue announced in May 2018 that it would allow individuals who received a Christmas bonus under S.I. No. 523/2017 &ndash; Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) Regulations 2017 to take that into account for the AMRF limit (and for the related limit for Personal Retirement Savings Accounts).  AMRF owners whose only pension is a State Pension (Contributory) may already have had their AMRF converted into an ARF when the Christmas bonus for 2017 was taken into account in computing their pension income. </p><p>Further information on the guaranteed pension income requirement is available in Chapter 23.5 of Revenue&rsquo;s Pensions Manual - www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/pensions/chapter-23.pdf.</p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s <i>Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023,</i>a number of specific actions have been allocated to the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG). The IDPRTG is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives from my Department as well as from the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, the Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, Revenue and the Pensions Authority.</p><p>Action 3.14 tasks the IDPRTG with undertaking &quot;a broad review of the utilisation of the ARF option&quot; and &quot;this will include a review of ARF criteria set out in tax legislation including specified minimum income requirements&quot;. To inform its work, the IDPRTG recently conducted a public consultation on Supplementary Pensions Reform, inviting interested parties to input to the process. The consultation paper set out three main discussion areas: Section A &ndash; Simplification &amp;amp; Reform; Section B &ndash; Costs; and Section C &ndash; Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs). The Public Consultation concluded on Friday 19 October. </p><p>The consultation responses are currently being collated and will be reviewed by the IDPRTG. The IDPRTG will then report on the Actions allocated to it in due course.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.316.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600064#WRG05500"><p>The move to real-time reporting is the most significant change to the PAYE system since its introduction more than fifty years ago. The modernisation programme will bring improved accuracy and transparency for all stakeholders, including employers, employees and Revenue, while also significantly streamlining the entire administration process. To that end, the introduction of PAYE Modernisation by Revenue is both much needed and very welcome.</p>  <p>  Since October 2016, when the project was launched, Revenue has worked extensively with all relevant stakeholders in a co-design approach, to ensure the new PAYE Modernisation reporting system reduces the administrative burden on employers to the greatest extent possible. For example, one of Revenue&rsquo;s key design principles is that employer reporting should be seamlessly integrated into the business&rsquo; payroll process. This will minimise the administrative burden on employers and allow their reporting obligations to Revenue to become a by-product of their payroll operation. In addition, the project will lead to the abolition of the current employer reporting obligations via P30, P35, P45, P46 and P60 forms. Revenue has advised me that employers have welcomed the abolition of these forms and the consequential reduction in the administrative burden.</p>  <p>  All employers are currently obliged to calculate and make the correct statutory deductions from their employees&rsquo; salary payments each time they pay. A significant number of employers, including small and medium employers, use payroll software to run their payroll and that will still be the case when PAYE Modernisation goes live on 1 January 2019. I am aware that Revenue has engaged extensively with the payroll software industry to ensure, as far as possible, that the necessary changes to their systems will be ready on time. Consequently, the processes for these employers before and after 1 January 2019 will be broadly similar.</p>  <p>  For employers who do not use payroll software, Revenue is providing an easy-to-use process within the Revenue Online Service (ROS) to capture payroll data for each employee. The process includes data screens that the employer will be obliged to complete for each employee every time a pay-run is completed (normally weekly, fortnightly or monthly). The burden associated with this work will be offset to an extent by the abolition of the previously mentioned forms that operate under the current system. In addition, the data required is in line with what employers are currently required to provide on an employee&rsquo;s payslip under employment law. It is also very important to note that there is no change to current PAYE payment dates under the Modernisation programme.</p>  <p>  I know that Revenue is very conscious that some employers may experience difficulties in the early phases of PAYE Modernisation and has assured me that it will make every effort to assist where required. For example, the Revenue Employer Helpdesk will have significant additional resources available to it to meet customer demand and officials will be available to visit employers should the need arise. Revenue has also assured me that it is not the intention to impose sanctions such as interest and penalties during the early transitional months where employers do their best to comply. However, Revenue always reserves the right to impose sanctions where there is clear non-engagement with the law.  </p>  <p>  Finally, while it is a matter for each employer to consider the impact that PAYE Modernisation will have on payroll arrangements and to put steps in place to ensure compliance with the new requirements, I would strongly encourage that they pro-actively engage with the changeover.  I would particularly recommend that they review the very detailed PAYE Modernisation material that is available on the Revenue website at link www.revenue.ie/pmod174 and that they contact the Revenue Employer Helpdesk at telephone number 01-7383638 if they have any queries or require any clarifications. </p>  <p>  I would also recommend that employers consult their payroll software providers as a priority to ensure the payroll systems are compatible with the requirements for PAYE Modernisation.</p></reply>

The Group A threshold applies, in general, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. The Group B threshold applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. The Group C threshold applies in all other cases.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, I announced an increase in the CAT Group A threshold from &euro;310,000 to &euro;320,000 in response to particular concerns on the tax burden arising from the inheritance of the family home. In the case of a niece or nephew inheriting, the Group B threshold applies and this was not changed in Budget 2019 and is currently &euro;32,500.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that the leasing of land to the spouse or civil partner of a brother or sister of the lessor or the leasing of land to the brother or sister of a spouse or civil partner of a lessor is regarded as a lease between connected persons and is not eligible for relief on the long-term leasing of farm land.</p>  <p>  Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides relief from income tax for certain income from the long-term leasing. The relief is available, subject to a maximum limit, where farmland is leased to a qualifying lessee for a period of five years or more. In order to qualify as a qualifying lessee for the purpose of the relief, the lessee must not be connected with the lessor, or with any of the lessors if there is more than one. The rules for establishing whether or not persons are connected are laid down by Section 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which sets out that a lessor is not entitled to relief where the land is let to family members or family members of their spouse or civil partner. </p>  <p>  The restriction on leases between connected persons is intended to prevent the misuse of the exemption. In addition, allowing relief in cases where the land was leased to connected persons could delay succession or lead to the fragmentation of holdings. </p>  <p>  The connected party restriction has applied since the introduction of the relief over 30 years ago.</p></reply>

In 2018, recipients of MIR qualified for 75% of the relief that they qualified for in 2017. From January 2019, recipients will qualify for 50% of the relief that they qualified for in 2017. </p><p>Without this extension provided for in Budget 2018, each remaining relief holder would have faced a &lsquo;cliff&rsquo; where the relief would have ceased entirely in January 2018.

This involves a transition period being agreed until end-2020, and a free trade agreement being agreed thereafter. The impact of this scenario is to lower the level of GDP by almost 2 percentage points over the 2021-2023 period relative to a no-Brexit baseline. This feeds through to the fiscal projections underlying the Budget. The macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the Budget were endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council as is legally required. </p>  <p>  The text on policy strategy in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook, published as part of Budget 2019, is almost entirely about the risk of a disorderly exit and outlines that the policy response should be to enhance the resilience of the economy. Chapter 6 of the same document, on Risk and Sensitivity Analysis, includes Box 5 on alterative Brexit scenarios. This shows that over the medium-term (i.e. after five years) the impact of a disorderly Brexit would be to reduce the level of GDP by around 3&frac14; percentage points compared with a no-Brexit baseline. It explicitly states that this should be seen as a minimum not a maximum effect. </p>  <p>  Using the ESRI&rsquo;s COSMO model, Budget 2019 also provides a sensitivity analysis to simulate the impact of a 1 per cent deterioration in global demand on our public finances, as measured through the general government balance. This specific external shock could arise through a number of channels, including through Brexit. </p>  <p>  The measures introduced in Budget 2019 continue the process of ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s economy remains competitive and resilient against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty, including from Brexit. Eliminating the deficit is part of the policy response, as is achieving the Medium-Term Budgetary Objective, the avoidance of pro-cyclical policies, putting the debt-ratio on a downward path and establishing and resourcing the Rainy Day Fund. This is complemented by our longer-term economic strategy for investing in the productive capacity of our economy, especially through Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The Government is working hard with the EU Taskforce and our EU partners to ensure that an agreement between the EU and the UK is reached. While it is still Government&rsquo;s view that a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; outcome remains unlikely, we are planning for all scenarios.  </p></reply>

I would also note that I have no role in relation to the preparation or audit of the financial statements in any of the publicly quoted banks.</p><p>I have however received the following response from AIB:</p><p>&quot;  <i>On transition to IFRS 9, there was no material change to provisions on impaired loans that were included in credit impaired loans (i.e. Stage 3) on 1 January 2018. As disclosed on Page 112 (Half Year Financial Report). AIB increased impairment provisions by &euro;271m on transition to IFRS 9, and this was primarily driven by non-credit impaired loans (i.e. Stage 1 &amp;amp; 2).</i></p><p>Regarding press coverage on the sale of a loan portfolio, AIB notes:</p><p>-  The IFRS 9 increase in provisions (Eur 271m) is due to the move to expected lifetime losses under IFRS 9, while the gain on disposal (Eur 140m) is related to the sale of a loan portfolio.  These are two separate and unrelated events and AIB is very comfortable with the accounting treatment of these and all related matters.</p><p><i>-  The impact of transition to IFRS 9 on the portfolio that was subsequently sold was de minimis. The gain was therefore not related to or as result of transition to IFRS 9. </i></p><p><i>-  AIB&rsquo;s capital position of 17.9% CET1 fully loaded at September 2018 fully reflects all impacts of the portfolio sale.  AIB notes the positive outcome from the EBA stress tests and continuing strong capital generation.&quot;</i></p><p>The Deputy may also be aware of the research commentary from Goodbody Stockbrokers on 5 November 2018 which referred to the media article and stated:</p><p><i>&quot;From what we can see the journalist completely mixes up IFRS 9 and the portfolio sale gain, which are two separate and non-related issues. The IFRS 9 increase in provisions is due to move to expected lifetime losses, whilst the gain on disposal was a separate matter and reflects consideration versus net carrying value (with c 40% coverage) and the capital benefit of lower RWAs. We note that AIB took the full IFRS 9 hit to capital on January 1, which saw its capital step down the &euro;271m figure or 50pbs from 17.5% on December 31 to 17.0% on January 1, an outcome also reflected in the EBA stress test starting balance sheet and a treatment used by other banks on IFRS 9 introduction&quot;.</i></p></reply>

The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated any differently to any other driver subject to their ability to demonstrate, and the insurance company to verify, continuous driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  What this means is that the returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.</p><p>In relation to the implementation of this recommendation, Insurance Ireland submitted a report to the Department in December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and any other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website. </p><p>The Insurance Ireland report also outlined some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provided figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) decreased during the first six months of 2017.  I understand that the DCA figures subsequently provided in respect of the second half of last year showed that this downward trend continued throughout the remainder of 2017.  The next report on the operation of the DCA, outlining the figures for 2018, is due to be submitted to my Department in Q1 2019. Officials will examine the breakdown of the number of cases in the report to determine if the downward trend is continuing.</p><p>It is important to highlight that if a returning emigrant believes that they have received a high quote due to an insurance provider not accepting driving experience gained while abroad, they should contact the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761820. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy should also note that my officials are continuing to monitor the implementation of this recommendation through their regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.</p></reply>

It should be noted that married couples and civil partners who are jointly assessed are counted as one taxpayer unit. <table><tr><th>Home Carer Tax Credit</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>Taxpayer units receiving full credit*</td><td>69,000</td><td>69,200</td><td>70,200</td></tr><tr><td>Taxpayer units receiving partial credit*</td><td>11,800</td><td>11,700</td><td>15,700</td></tr><tr><td>Total taxpayer units*</td><td>80,900</td><td>80,900</td><td>85,900</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of credit (&euro;m)</td><td>61</td><td>61</td><td>78</td></tr></table></p><p>*Numbers rounded to the nearest hundred.</p><p>The figures provided represent income earners who utilised at least some of the Home Carer Tax Credit to reduce their income tax liability.  The figures do not include the number of potential claimants whose entitlement to other tax credits was sufficient to reduce their tax liability to nil without availing of the Home Carer Tax Credit.  Revenue estimates the number of claimants in such a position was 47,000 in 2014, 44,000 in 2015 and 45,000 in 2016.  It is not possible to break down the number of recipients of the credit by dependant type as there is no requirement to indicate this information on tax returns.</p><p>The projected cost of the Home Carer Tax Credit for 2019 is approximately &euro;115 million. This estimate is provisional and may be revised.</p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that it has no information in relation to numbers of cases who have not applied for the credit.  However, it should be noted that Revenue staff automatically grant the Home Carer Tax Credit where they identify eligible persons whose circumstances indicate that they would benefit from the credit. </p><p>Finally, I am aware that Revenue continues to contact PAYE taxpayers to remind them that there is a four-year time limit for claiming additional tax credits and reliefs. For example, in late 2017 letters issued to all PAYE taxpayers who had not claimed additional credits or reliefs from 2013 to 2017, reminding them that they may be entitled to make a claim on or before 31 December 2017. An additional 291 claims were made for the Home Carer Tax Credit following the issue of this letter. Similar letters will issue this year.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting such rules.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this,  my officials raised the Deputy&rsquo;s query with Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry in Ireland. On the basis of this enquiry, I have been advised that as an insurance contract includes a duty of utmost good faith on both the insurer and insured, a duty of disclosure of all material facts is required from which insurers will make their underwriting decision on the provision of cover. In general, insurers will use a combination of individual rating factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to age, type of driving licence, engine size, rebuilding cost of property, previous convictions if applicable, etc., but they will vary by insurer depending on the market segments, on which individual insurers focus and the claims experience of individual insurers.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland also acknowledged that access to and fair treatment by financial services providers is an important part of social inclusion which is mandated by the Consumer Protection Code. It is noted in this regard that the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 allows for certain convictions to become spent after a period of time.</p>  <p>  In relation to motor insurance specifically, the Deputy is  aware of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA).  That agreement is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland.  It states that if a consumer is unable to secure a quotation on the open market, he or she may be in a position to avail of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA) process.  Under the terms of the DCA, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.</p>  <p>  Data obtained from Insurance Ireland states that the total number of DCA applications in 2017 was 1,423.  In that year, &lsquo;convictions&rsquo; was noted 261 times as the primary reason the applicant was declined motor insurance. </p>  <p>  There are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website in relation to the DCA, while Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  The relevant contact details are: feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.  </p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.  </p><p>However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the insurance sector has been subject to volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level in the motor sphere to the more recent experience of large increases across a number of lines.</p><p>The problem of rising insurance premiums was the impetus in 2016 for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group which is now chaired by the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D.  Its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance </i>was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan. The Working Group continued its work throughout 2017 and subsequently published the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>in January 2018. In both of these Reports the factors as to why insurance costs have increased has been set out, however no evidence was presented that insurance companies were deliberately exaggerating the size of pay-outs in order to increase premiums. </p><p>It is clear however from the Working Group&rsquo;s extensive consultations that there is a lack of transparency around the personal injuries claims environment.  A similar view was expressed in the Joint Oireachtas Committee report.  Consequently, transparency has been one of the key themes of both the Motor and Employer and Public Liability Reports.</p><p>In this context therefore an important step forward is the approval by the Government to publish the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018.  The Bill, which is currently being considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas, when enacted, will enable the Central Bank to publish an annual report using data gathered from the insurance industry to increase transparency on the relationship between insurance premiums and related costs, identifying the factors that drive movements in the price of insurance in the State, the number of claims, as well as providing statistical analyses of the costs associated with settling claims, and importantly understanding the settlement channels used.  I am hopeful that with the cooperation of all parties in the Houses, it can be approved expeditiously to have the database in place as soon as possible. It should be noted that the  initial focus of the database will be on motor insurance.</p><p>With regard to the total amounts companies paid out in claims between 2015 and 2018, the Central Bank has very limited data of this type available to it. This is because with the European-wide transition from Solvency I to Solvency II regulatory regime (in place since 1 January 2016), it no longer produces the annual Insurance Statistics publication, known as the &lsquo;Blue Book&rsquo;.  The tables in the Blue Book were extracted from the Solvency I forms which were completed by the industry and were publicly available (in the Companies Registration Office) and, as these are no longer completed, most of the Blue Book tables cannot be continued in the old format.  Furthermore, the underlying data in the Blue Book is now valued on the Solvency II, as opposed to the Solvency I, basis and many of the time series have been broken. </p><p>That said however the Central Bank provided my officials with the data below for a previous PQ in July 2018 in relation to motor insurance claims for the years 2013 to 2017.  This data includes both private and commercial motor insurance, and excludes the costs associated with the settlement of these claims.  <table><tr><th>Calendar year </th><th>Gross paid claims (&euro;m) </th></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>869 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>932 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>921 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>956 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>953 </td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy should note that the data reflects the business of insurance undertakings prudentially supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland (6 undertakings) and undertakings operating on a freedom of establishment basis (3 undertakings).  It does not however include any data related to insurance undertakings operating in Ireland under freedom to provide services.  In addition, these claim amounts do not represent a constant market size and/or share as, for example, the number of vehicles insured by these undertaking will have varied each year.  The Central Bank advised at the time that direct comparison of earned premiums to paid claims is not necessarily appropriate, as it is important to also consider the reserves set aside to meet claims that have not yet been settled and/or notified.  </p></reply>

However, Revenue does keep its telephony infrastructure under constant review to ensure that it delivers the most robust and cost-effective service possible for taxpayers. </p>  <p>  Up to recently, the 1890 LoCall service was considered the best option for delivering an effective high-volume telephone service at minimum cost. However, the service does incur additional charges for some customers that are imposed by their telephone service providers and which are outside of Revenue&rsquo;s control. Revenue made a submission to the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) in 2017 expressing its dissatisfaction at the rates charged by service providers for these 1890 calls and supported ComReg&rsquo;s proposal that the retail charge applicable should not exceed the retail charge that would apply had the caller used a standard telephone number.  </p>  <p>  To reduce the cost burden on customers, Revenue launched a new telephony platform on 26 September 2018 that optimises some of the most up to date technology available and which facilitates phone calls using standard telephone numbers that do not incur the range of charges currently applied by service providers to 1890 calls. </p>  <p>  On a wider note, I am aware that Revenue has significantly enhanced its range of online services to reduce the need for customer telephone contact.  This includes a new website www.revenue.ie which is specifically designed to help customers more easily find the information they are looking for. The information on the website is written in plain language and is easy to find. Revenue has advised me that the feedback to date strongly confirms that the new service is very effective and has been well received by the majority of users.</p></reply>

These measures will take effect from 1 January 2019 and will help fund public services. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s priority in recent years has been to level the playing field by extending the betting tax to remote bookmakers and betting exchanges. This was achieved in 2015, via the Betting Amendment Act, and I believe it is now timely to increase the rates of betting duty and betting intermediary duty. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that traditional retail bookmakers face ongoing challenges from the on-line sector. It is a fact that advances in technology have challenged existing business models and have changed the structure of many markets, including the betting market.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that receipts from traditional bookmakers have remained stable and displayed some year-on-year growth in recent years. Yields from traditional bookmakers have increased from &euro;25.4m in 2013 to &euro;29m in 2017, implying an increase in turnover of about 14% during this period, from &euro;2.54 billion to &euro;2.9 billion. This demonstrates the resilience of traditional bookmakers in the face of ongoing challenges.   </p>  <p>  I appreciate the concerns raised by the betting sector following the budget. However, this increase must be seen in the context of the rate being at an all-time low. In the past the tax was 20% of turnover and the last time the rate increased was in 1975. It is also worth pointing out that VAT does not apply to betting services, also there are on-course exemptions from betting duty, that the bookmakers licence fees are low and have not increased since 1992, and last but not least, the fact that there is a raised public consciousness on the social costs of problem gambling.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I do not propose to change the increase provided for in Budget 2019.</p></reply>

It also requires the use of an incurred loss approach for the calculation of impairment provisions on loans resulting in impairment provisions being recognised only when losses are incurred and not before then. Under the incurred loss approach an entity assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a loan or group of loans is impaired. IAS 39 states that a loan is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if there is &ldquo;objective evidence&rdquo; of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the exposure was created (&ldquo;the loss event&rdquo;) and that the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the loans and these cash flows can be reliably estimated.</p>  <p>  In April 2009 the G20 leaders called on "the accounting standard setters to work urgently with supervisors and regulators to improve standards on valuation and provisioning and achieve a single set of high-quality global accounting standards".  In this regard the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a new accounting standard for Financial Instruments, IFRS 9, which replaces IAS 39. IFRS 9 is applicable for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 introduces a new regime for impairment provisioning and imposes an Expected Credit Loss approach to provisioning as opposed to the incurred loss approach that is required by IAS 39.</p></reply>

The paper contained a number of proposals for consideration in the Central Bank review of the Credit Union Lending Framework, which could provide for a material increase in long-term lending for those credit unions with the capability to do so. Following the submission of this paper to the Central Bank, I wrote to Governor Lane outlining my strong support for this very important matter being progressed in 2018. </p>  <p>  In March 2018 the Central Bank informed Credit Unions that a review of credit union lending limits had commenced, noting that the matter had been highlighted for review in various foras, including through the Implementation Group. To help inform their review, and in order to get individual credit union input, the Central Bank issued a longer term lending questionnaire to Credit Unions in April 2018. The Consultation Paper on Potential Changes to the Lending Framework for Credit Unions (CP125) was published on 24 October. </p>  <p>  The proposals contained in CP125 include the removal of the existing lending maturity limits which cap the percentage of credit union lending which may be outstanding for periods of greater than 5 and 10 years and the introduction of concentration limits, on a tiered basis, for home mortgage and commercial loans expressed as a percentage of total assets. The proposed concentration limits would permit all credit unions to undertake combined house and commercial lending of up to 7.5% of total assets, but with a limit of 5% of total assets for either one of the categories. </p>  <p>  The consultation paper also proposes that an increased combined concentration limit of 15% of total assets would be available to those credit unions who can demonstrate that they have strong core foundations to undertake additional house and commercial lending including the necessary financial strength, skills, expertise, operational and risk management capability. Prior approval from the Central Bank would be required in order for a credit union to avail of this increased combined concentration limit.</p>  <p>  Based on the data supplied in the Consultation Paper, the proposals would allow in the first instance a sectorial capacity of &euro;861m for house loans.  To put this figure in context, as per June 2018 Prudential Returns, there is approximately &euro;165m of house loans currently outstanding across the sector. This capacity would increase as Credit Unions are approved for the higher concentration limit. In the case where all Credit Unions with assets greater than &euro;100m were approved for the higher limit, sector capacity could increase to a maximum of c. &euro;1.8bn.</p>  <p>  It is important that credit unions who wish to undertake increased house and commercial lending understand the risks involved; and in accordance with section 35(2) of Credit Union Act 1997 the ability of the member to repay the loan should be a primary consideration in the underwriting process for the credit union.</p>  <p>  Credit Unions, their representative bodies, and other stakeholders will now have an opportunity to analyse the proposals put forward in CP125 and engage in the Consultation by submitting their views to the Central Bank. The consultation period is open for submissions until 9 January 2019. My officials and I will review the proposed amendments, liaise with the Central Bank and input into the statutory consultation process when it arises.</p></reply>

Each of the six updates produced thus far are available on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website, with the seventh report due to be published shortly. </p>  <p>  Both of the Working Group&rsquo;s Reports contain measures targeted at reducing fraud, most of which relate to the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the Motor Report, Recommendation 25 called for the establishment of a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database for industry to detect patterns of fraud, while Recommendation 26 supported exploring the potential for further cooperation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to insurance fraud investigation.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of Recommendation 25 has been impacted by the application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into effect from 25 May 2018, and the related Data Protection Act.  As a result, Insurance Ireland has undertaken a detailed Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in relation to matters such as the information currently held on Insurance Link and the specific additional data it is proposed will be shared, plus the additional circumstances under which the data will be shared.  The Department of Justice and Equality are currently reviewing that DPIA.</p>  <p>  In relation to the establishment of a dedicated Garda insurance fraud unit, Insurance Ireland communicated the outcome of its cost/benefit analysis at the start of July 2018, recommending industry funding of such a unit.  Discussions are continuing between relevant officials in the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard.  In addition, I understand that the Minister for Justice and Equality met with senior Garda management on 30 August to discuss the proposal.  The Minister will receive a proposal from the Garda Commissioner following the Commissioner&rsquo;s consideration of this recommendation.  </p>  <p>  In the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, Recommendation 13 called for the agreement of a new set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of alleged insurance fraud. The agreed Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was released on 1 October.  These Guidelines are publically available on the Garda website and a copy has also been sent to relevant bodies who had been involved in the consultation process such as the Self-Insured Taskforce, Irish Public Bodies, Lloyd&rsquo;s and the State Claims Agency, as well as the Car Rental Council of Ireland.  I believe that the Guidelines will assist and provide support to these organisations, as well as insurance companies, when reporting suspected insurance fraud to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  A &lsquo;spin-off&rsquo; occurrence from the implementation of this recommendation has been a commitment for the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud.  This positive development is an opportunity for greater communication and improved processes and it is hoped that it will lead to a better understanding on both sides of the issues arising in the investigation and reporting of fraud. </p>  <p>  Other recommendations in the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance seek the production of reliable statistics in respect of the numbers of complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions related to insurance claim fraud, improved notification procedures for potential defendants of personal injury claims submitted against their policy, and stricter enforcement of the requirement for plaintiffs to lodge verifying affidavits within the set timeframe.</p>  <p>  Overall, it is intended that the implementation of all the recommendations from the two Reports cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, can lead to both reduced incentives for, and greater deterrents against, the undertaking of fraudulent insurance-related activities.</p></reply>

An EU regulation reduced the interchange fee charged to retailers to 30 basis points for credit cards, and Ireland reduced the corresponding fee for domestic consumer debit cards to 10 basis points, giving us one of the lowest rates of interchange fees on debit cards in the EU. Just before that, on 31 October 2015, the transaction limit on contactless payment cards was raised from &euro;15 to &euro;30.</p>  <p>  To support these EU and industry changes, Budget 2016 abolished stamp duty charges on debit and cash machine cards. These were replaced with a 12c per transaction charge for withdrawing cash from an ATM, though with a cap set at an annual maximum charge of &euro;2.50 or &euro;5 depending on card type.</p>  <p>  The changes made at that time reduced the costs to merchants of accepting card payments and made card usage more attractive, as evidenced by the strong growth in electronic payments generally and debit cards in particular. The latest Central Bank credit and debit card statistical release shows that there were 74 million debit card point-of-sale transactions in September 2018, up 75% on September 2015. </p>  <p>  Almost one in three card payments are now contactless, and figures released last week by the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland show that the quarterly value of contactless card payments exceeded &euro;1 billion for the first time in the second quarter of 2018. The statistics show that consumers are using their cards, and that merchants are accepting card payments to a greater extent than ever. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, last month launched a &euro;625,000 pilot scheme for eligible SMEs in the retail sector. The new scheme, to be delivered by Enterprise Ireland, supports retailers to strengthen their online trading capabilities in order to compete internationally, and grants of between &euro;10,000 to &euro;25,000 are available on a matched funding basis to enhance digital capability.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach has launched a public consultation on a new National Digital Strategy for Ireland, which aims to map out how we can positively embrace digital advances. The public consultation aims to give the public and interested stakeholders a chance to tell Government what priorities should be addressed in the Strategy, including what supports are needed by businesses to benefit fully from the use of digital technology.  That consultation is available on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach until 23 November.</p></reply>

It set out a vision for payments, including universal acceptance of electronic forms of payment, robust and reliable payment systems, and migration from cash and cheques to cards and electronic payments. The table below sets out the NPP recommendations and the status of implementation: </p><p><table><tr><th>Recommendation</th><th>Status</th><th>Comment</th></tr><tr><td>Facilitate interoperability of mobile based payments</td><td>Ongoing</td><td>Technological developments in recent years have greatly facilitated the development of interoperable mobile based payments and increased the number of solutions available to consumers</td></tr><tr><td>Introduce contactless debit cards</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Banks have issued contactless cards and usage is increasing rapidly</td></tr><tr><td>Develop public and private sector e-Payments acceptance plans</td><td>Ongoing</td><td>E-Day initiative in September 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Require taxis to take payment cards</td><td>Ongoing</td><td>Acceptance by taxis has increased significantly, aided by new technology</td></tr><tr><td>Introduce a Standard Bank Account</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Payment accounts with basic features were introduced in 2016 with the transposition of the Payment Accounts Directive</td></tr><tr><td>Progress Social Welfare Payments Strategy</td><td>Ongoing</td><td>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has a strategy to implement greater electronic payments</td></tr><tr><td>Incentivise the consumer to use e-Payments</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Stamp duty was reformed in Budget 2016</td></tr><tr><td>Incentivise the merchant to accept card payment</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Reduction in interchange fees together with the introduction of contactless cards have greatly improved the attractiveness of cards for retailers</td></tr><tr><td>Phase out stamp duty on debit and pre-paid cards</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Stamp duty was reformed in Budget 2016</td></tr><tr><td>End date for cheque usage between Government and business</td><td>Achieved</td><td>E-Day implemented in September 2014</td></tr><tr><td>Implement bank cheque migration initiatives; re-presentation of unpaid cheques to be stopped; modernise'Client Account' payments practices</td><td>Ongoing</td><td>Cheque usage has steadily declined. The number of cheques used has halved in less than six years. Per capita cheque usage in Ireland is now 8 a year (compared with 237 e-payments), and usage is falling by 10 per cent a year</td></tr><tr><td>Prepare review of the Irish cash cycle</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Central Bank National Cash Forum regularly reviews</td></tr><tr><td>Increase dispensing of &euro;10 notes in ATMs</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Targets set in NPP met and the Central Bank set additional targets to end-2018</td></tr><tr><td>Pilot discontinuing use of 1c/2c coins</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Following a successful pilot in Wexford in 2013, voluntary rounding was rolled out nationally from October 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland to have fully migrated to SEPA</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Ireland fully migrated to SEPA in 2016, within the regulatory timeline</td></tr><tr><td>Support a broad education and support campaign to drive a change in payment habits</td><td>Achieved</td><td>Industry coordinated a &lsquo;cashless Cork&rsquo; initiative. Advertising has contributed to a large rise in electronic payments generally, and contactless payments in particular</td></tr></table></p><p>Under the National Payments Plan, Ireland made significant progress including full migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). Rounding of 1c and 2c coins was rolled out nationally from October 2015 and has been generally welcomed. All of the major banks now issue debit cards, most of them with contactless capability, and the contactless payment limit is now &euro;30. The latest Banking and Payments Federation <i>Payments Monitor</i>shows that in the first half of this year, contactless payments grew by 66% year-on-year in both volume terms and value terms. </p><p>In December 2015, interchange rates were reduced to make card acceptance more attractive for retailers. Stamp duty on debit cards was reformed with the effect that stamp duty was removed and replaced with a 12c charge per ATM transaction. The implementation of 'e-Day' by Government in September 2014 &ndash; from which time Government Departments, Local Authorities and State Agencies no longer routinely use cheques in their dealings with businesses - resulted in a significant decrease in cheque volumes. The Banking and Payments Federation reports that cheque usage continues to fall, with for the first half of 2018 down 10.3% year-on-year.</p><p>The measures recommended under the National Payments Plan were designed to ensure that the payments environment facilitates increased adoption of more efficient payment methods.  They should not be seen in isolation.  The EU is working to create a single market for payments across the Member States and my Department has led on transposing EU measures on payments. The Payment Accounts Directive was transposed in September 2016 and it ensures access to a payment account with basic features for anyone who does not have a payment account, one of the recommendations contained in the National Payments Plan. </p><p>The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), transposed in January 2018, further opens the EU payment market for companies offering consumer or business-oriented payment services based on access to payment accounts and ensure a level playing field for both existing and new players.</p><p>The Deputy may be interested to know that the Central Bank recently established a forum on retail payments, where payment services providers and payment services users can come together to engage in an open and constructive dialogue with each other in relation to Irish retail payment services generally.  </p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that my Department earlier this year commissioned research to benchmark payments in Ireland, and that I expect to receive a report on this in the coming months.</p></reply>

These are determined by EU regulation &ndash; specifically Regulation (EU) 575/2013, the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). This regulation permits credit institutions to use either the Standardised approach or the Internal Rating Based (IRB) Approach for the purposes of allocation of RWs for credit risk purposes. </p>  <p>  With regard to the use of the Standardised approach for credit risk, the allocation of the applicable RW will differ depending on whether the exposure in question is secured by residential or commercial real estate. </p>  <p>  With respect to exposures secured by residential real estate (or mortgages), in line with the Competent Authority discretion under Article 124(2) CRR, a 35% risk weight is applied to a) owner-occupied housing and b) loans with an LTV of up to 75%.  Where these conditions are not met (i.e., buy-to-let or LTV above 75%) loans may attract a 75% RW provided it satisfies the definition of &lsquo;retail exposure&rsquo; under Article 123 CRR (otherwise a 100% RW will apply).</p>  <p>  In contrast, credit institutions utilising the IRB approach must estimate a probability of default (PD) and a loss given default (LGD) for each mortgage. These parameters are then used to calculate the RW. </p>  <p>  Statistical models are used to assign a PD and LGD to each mortgage. These models are essentially &ldquo;rules&rdquo; that assign specific PDs/LGDs to mortgages depending on the particular characteristics of each mortgage. Credit institutions analyse the behaviour of customers historically to determine which characteristics (also known as risk drivers) should be included in the model. Each individual credit institution decides which risk drivers to include in their PD and LGD models, which could include customer, mortgage performance and collateral information. </p>  <p>  In summary, the relationship between the risk weighting applied to a mortgage and the underlying risk profile depends on whether a credit institution applies the Standardised approach or the IRB approach. The latter approach is more risk sensitive as it assigns risk weights with reference to the relevant underlying characteristics of a mortgage.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also advised that while it cannot provide confidential information on the IRB models of Single Supervisory Mechanism regulated entities, credit institutions publish certain information on their models and the output of their models (as part of their annual pillar 3 disclosures and annual reports) including average PD, LGD, and RW.</p></reply>

These arrangements include the ability to request hard copies of End of Year statements by telephone, written correspondence or by calling into a Revenue public office.</p>  <p>  While Revenue must always be cognisant of taxpayer confidentiality and general data protection regulations it is accepted that occasions will arise where a person requires another individual to act on his or her behalf (with Revenue) in respect of their tax affairs.  In such circumstances, Revenue will engage with a nominated representative providing that person can clearly prove that the taxpayer has authorised him/her to operate in that capacity. </p>  <p>  In the specific circumstances that I believe the Deputy is highlighting, it could be that the request for an End of Year statement is made to Revenue by a line manager and the hard-copy documentation is sent directly to the taxpayer in question thereby ensuring against any breach of confidentiality.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.410.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600066#WRJ01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 to 214, inclusive, together.</p><p>Regarding Question 45676, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a deferral or partial deferral (50%) of LPT where certain specified circumstances exist.  These circumstances include &lsquo;Income Level&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hardship&rsquo;, &lsquo;Personal Insolvency&rsquo; and &lsquo;Personal Representative of a Deceased Person&rsquo;. </p><p>Once granted, a deferral normally remains in place for the duration of the &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo;, which is currently 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019.  However, property owners can opt to pay the outstanding liability at any time and discontinue with the deferral.  Where a deferral is in place, the outstanding liability remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.  Interest is also charged on the deferred amount at a rate of 4% per annum.  There are currently over 59,000 properties with LPT deferrals in place, most of which are in respect of the entire Valuation Period (2013-2019).  Table 1 below sets out the numbers and values of properties with deferred liabilities for each year since the commencement of LPT.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>No of Taxpayers with LPT Deferrals<table><tr><th>Deferrals</th><th>Full  </th><th>Partial</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Liability   Year</td><td>,000</td><td>,000</td><td>,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>30</td><td>2</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>38</td><td>2</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>46</td><td>2</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>55</td><td>2</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>58</td><td>2</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>57</td><td>2</td><td>59</td></tr></table></p><p>The accumulated deferral interest amount charged for the entire Valuation Period (2013-2019) is in the region of more than &euro;7m.  It is not possible to provide the exact amount of this interest that has been collected to date because some elements are at different points in the collection cycle while other elements are still reflected as charges against the properties in question.  However, Revenue is confident that the full amount will be collected over time.  I have no plans to abolish the reduced interest rate of 4% on deferred liabilities.  </p><p>Regarding Question 45677, I am advised by Revenue that there are a range of options available to pay LPT, including the options to pay by deduction at source (DaS).  DaS allows a property owner to pay LPT in equal amounts over the year, from either an employment, occupational pension, a Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) payment, or a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) payment.  Specific data relating to deductions from occupational pensions is not available as these payments are categorised on Revenue records as deriving from employment.  The overall numbers including the total amount collected each year from all DaS sources are set out in Table 2 below.</p><p>Table 2<table><tr><th>Liability   Year</th><th>Number of employees / occupational pensioners on DaS</th><th>Total Amount of Payments </th></tr><tr><td></td><td>,000</td><td>m</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>87</td><td>&euro;14</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>142</td><td>&euro;55</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>161</td><td>&euro;53</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>176</td><td>&euro;57</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>187</td><td>&euro;60</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>195</td><td>&euro;61   (by year end)</td></tr></table></p><p>Regarding Question 45678, I am advised by Revenue that payments made via Service Providers (An Post, Payzone and Omnivend) enables property owners to make either a single LPT payment or to pay on a phased basis over the year.  Single payments are due by the LPT deadline in January each year while phased payments can be made on a weekly or monthly basis to suit an individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  The various service providers are commercial operations and levy transaction charges that are outside of Revenue&rsquo;s control.  The amount of LPT collected each year via Service Providers since the commencement of LPT is set out in Table 3 below:</p><p>Table 3<table><tr><th>Liability Year</th><th>LPT Collected via Service Provider (m)</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;21</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;44</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;44</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;44</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;47</td></tr><tr><td>2018 To Date</td><td>&euro;42</td></tr></table></p><p>Finally, property owners who fail to comply with their LPT obligations, regardless of the payment methods selected, may be subject to a range of collection and enforcement options that are provided to Revenue under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) including:</p><p>-  Mandatory deduction from employment income, occupational pension or certain Government payments.</p><p>-  Referral of the outstanding debt to a Sheriff or Solicitor for collection.</p><p>-  Placing of an Attachment order on a bank account or 3<sup>rd</sup>party debt owed to the defaulting taxpayer.</p><p>-  A surcharge on Income Tax, Corporation Tax or Capital Gains Tax Returns.</p><p>-  Interest charges of 8% per annum applied from the due date to the date of the payment.</p><p>-  A charge on the property, which must be paid before any sale or transfer of ownership can take place.</p><p>-  Withholding of Tax Clearance certification.</p><p>-  Offset of any refunds due in other taxes to outstanding LPT/Household Charge liabilities.</p></reply>

The exemptions set out restrictions on the value of goods and quantitative limits on excisable products.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been clear that it wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade, in order to minimise the impact on our trade and economy.</p>  <p>  While the framework of the future relationship is being discussed with a view to agreeing a Political Declaration alongside the Withdrawal Agreement, detailed negotiations on the exact nature of the future relationship cannot begin until after the UK formally ceases to be an EU Member State on 29 March 2019.

Where the custody of a child is shared equally between two individuals, the legislation provides that the primary claimant shall be the person in receipt of the child benefit payment from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where the primary carer cannot utilise the credit &ndash; for example, because of insufficient taxable income - the primary carer may relinquish the credit and a secondary claimant may claim it.  The requirement for a primary claimant to relinquish the credit before a claim from a secondary claimant can be considered is necessary, as only one credit is available in respect of a qualifying child or children and depending on individual circumstances, an individual might wish to retain the credit in order to offset any tax liability that might arise as a result of a review of their income tax liabilities in any of the years concerned.</p>  <p>  On the question of whether there are any plans to amend the current rules of the SPCCC, I appreciate that it may not always be a straightforward determination between parents or guardians, but there are no firm plans at present.  That said, on foot of engagement with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in 2018, I have asked my officials to look at this measure in 2019 and in that context, any proposals for how to better allocate the tax credit are always welcome. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, I am satisfied that the SPCCC is targeting limited resources to where they are most needed, noting that in 2016 the credit costs &euro;90.3m and was claimed by 65,700 families.</p></reply>

As part of an internal system of information sharing, the OPW highlights all properties, including land, that it considers surplus to its requirements to other State bodies. Information on such surplus properties is available to Meath County Council. </p><p>As a matter of policy, no property is disposed of on the open market until other State bodies or the local authority sector, including Meath County Council, are advised of its availability.  If the local authority express an interest then there is a protocol for the transfer of that land or property at a value set independently by the Valuation Office.  While the OPW and Meath County Council are in discussions relating to two properties, there is no land transfer proposed for the specific purpose of house building at present. </p><p>In relation to properties in County Meath, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, (CPW), own a number of heritage properties with large land banks throughout the county such as Trim Castle, Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, and the Oldbridge Estate, which are open to the public.

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers transparency and value for money outcomes.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have responsibility for the formulation of policy, dissemination of best practice and guidance in public procurement.  I am not in a position to comment on the exclusion of a particular business from bidding for a public contract as it will depend on the circumstances of the business and the criteria that have been established for a particular procurement.</p>  <p>  Public procurement regulations require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  The criterion upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts is set out in Regulation 57 of S.I. No. 284 of 2016 - European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016 &ndash; transposing Article 57 of Directive 2014/24/EU &ndash; the EU Procurement Directive.</p>  <p>  The grounds for exclusion essentially fall into two categories; those that are mandatory and are applied to all procurements and those that the contracting authority chooses to apply to a particular procurement.  The Directive sets minimum periods for exclusion for the different categories and also specifies circumstances where a tenderer may satisfy a contracting authority that they have put measures in place that demonstrate their reliability despite the existence of a relevant ground for exclusion. </p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Directive to exclude a business from all procurement procedures.  The assessment as to whether a business is excluded or not is made on a case by case basis for each competition. </p>  <p>  Applicants for public contracts must declare whether any of the exclusion grounds specified in the procurement documents apply to them. A formal final judgement in respect of a mandatory exclusion ground is necessary before a contracting authority can legitimately take any action against a potential supplier.  Where voluntary exclusion grounds are concerned evidence of a specific breach is necessary.</p>  <p>  The contracting authority must consider the facts and must arrive at a decision based on evidence rather than hearsay or dissatisfaction.

Funding for special education provision in 2018 will amount to some &euro;1.75 billion, up 43% since 2011 and equivalent to 18.7% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training. Budget 2019 announced the funding of 950 additional SNA posts and 372 teaching posts to cater for the growth in student population and additional special classes.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Scheme is a school-based intervention provided to DEIS schools to address the needs of all pupils/families at risk of educational disadvantage through acknowledging and developing the role of the parent as prime educator. The role of the HSCL Coordinator is to work primarily with the salient adults in the child&rsquo;s life, in order to empower them, so that they can better support their children to attend school, participate in education and develop positive attitudes to life-long learning. Central to the HSCL initiative, is the identification of educational needs and the provision of a tailored and proportionate response to those needs, through a range of interventions, which are evidence-based, focused and structured. </p><p>The scheme is delivered by 416 full-time HSCL Coordinators who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils.<b></b>The current cost of this provision to my Department is &euro;25 million. For DEIS schools included in the HSCL Scheme, it is a requirement that at least 10% of the annual DEIS Grant to each school should be allocated for use on HSCL activities and made available to the HSCL Coordinator.  The total allocation for the DEIS grant from my Department is approximately &euro;16 million.  While the HSCL scheme is funded by my Department, Tusla the Child and Family Agency, which is the dedicated state agency responsible for improving wellbeing and outcomes for children has responsibility for the management of the HSCL Scheme.</p><p>My Department has no plans at present to extend this Scheme beyond DEIS Schools.  </p></reply>

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen. Schools are not required to report on such interventions. </p><p>Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken in relation to managing behaviour must be proportionate.</p><p>Tusla's Educational Welfare Service, under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has published guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour which all schools are required by law to have in place. The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.</p><p>Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p><p>A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published <i>Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties</i>, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie. The National Educational Psychological Services document <i>Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support </i>also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.</p><p>Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management of difficult behaviour.</p><p>Following a request by the Department for policy advice from the NCSE, which provided recommendations in relation to crisis situations and complex behavioural needs, work on developing guidelines for schools is underway. The Department will engage with education partners on these in the coming months. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be finalised by the end of this school year. The guidelines will assist schools in responding in circumstances where students pose an immediate threat of harm to themselves or others.</p><p>The guidelines will be underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines will also underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour. It is also expected that the guidelines will underline the importance of recording such incidents and how they are managed.</p><p>Where a parent, or any other person, has concerns about the care or safety of a child in school they should report these concerns to the Board of Management of the school in the first instance.</p><p>Where a parent or other person has a concern about the welfare or protection of a child in a school they may report the matter as a child protection concern to Tusla or to the Department of Education and Skills who will then report any child protection complaint in accordance with the Department's procedures.</p></reply>

This policy is in line with the provisions of the EPSEN Act 2004.</p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p><p>As such, this Department&rsquo;s policy focuses on ensuring that all students, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorders, can have access to an education appropriate to meeting their needs and abilities. </p><p>This policy has been informed by published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001), the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2006) and National Council for Special Education (NCSE) policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016). </p><p>The NCSE policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016) found that Students are generally well supported in schools with appropriate curriculum; extensive teacher and SNA supports; improved range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment; improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post primary levels. </p><p>The greater proportion of children with Autism attend mainstream classes, but some require the environment of a special class or special school. This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment and in consultation with the NCSE. </p><p>The NCSE is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers, for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements. </p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p><p>124 special schools provide specialist education for those students with the most complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with ASD.  </p><p>While most schools fully embrace an open and inclusive policy, some students with Special Educational Needs continue to experience difficulties in securing enrolment. My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities has been challenging.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when fully commenced will assist in addressing these issues.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that, on the 3rd October 2018, my predecessor, Minister Bruton commenced a number of sections of the Act. On that date the Minister also announced the commencement of Section 8 of the Act, from Monday 3rd December 2018, which will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs. </p><p>This power will come into effect on Monday 3rd December 2018.The NCSE is engaging with the education partners and with a view to finalising procedures in advance of this date. This new power will build on the work which has been done in recent years to facilitate schools to open special classes.</p><p>Section 67 of the Act will provide certain powers to the NCSE to designate a school placement for a child in circumstances where a child is experiencing difficulties in securing enrolment. </p><p>A number of the remaining sections of the Act which have not yet been commenced including Section 67, require regulations and procedures to be drafted, and will require consultation with the Education Partners prior to commencement.</p><p>I intend to have the other remaining sections of the Act commenced in time for admissions to the 2020/21 school year. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 have been commenced, including those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children. </p><p>A number of sections of the EPSEN Act have yet to be commenced. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the Act on a non-statutory basis.</p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially through policy developments across a range of areas.</p></reply>

Current expenditure on higher education, excluding pay restoration and pension provision, will increase by 10% in 2019 compared to 2016.  We are adopting a number of measures to address the financial challenges in higher education and to ensure that higher education investment is responsive to key strategic priorities.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 continued the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of reinvestment in higher education. Through the budget, we have provided &euro;57 million in additional current funding for the higher education sector. This is in addition to separate funding that has been provided for pay deals and pensions, amounting to an additional &euro;41 million in 2019. </p>  <p>  This new current funding will be used to fund the following measures: </p>  <p>  -  provision for 3,500 additional places in our higher education institutions </p>  <p>  -  initiatives to support innovation and reward excellence</p>  <p>  -  investment in teaching and learning capacity, and management and leadership</p>  <p>  -  1,000 additional places on Springboard+, </p>  <p>  -  a new research fund for Institutes of Technology/TUs, and </p>  <p>  -  an expansion of part-time and flexible learning opportunities. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 also announced a new Human Capital Initiative that will involve investment of &euro;300 million in higher education over the 5 year period from 2020 to 2024, with &euro;60 m being made available in each of those years. This investment will be funded by the National Training Fund surplus.  A major objective of the Initiative is to incentivise continued reform and innovation drawing on international best practice through such mechanisms as graduate conversion, accelerated course completion, flexible and blended learning, intensified focus on employability and strengthened linkages and relationships with enterprise.  It represents a significant response to projected demographic pressures impacting on the HE sector over the next five years, as highlighted in the Expert Group Report on Future Funding.</p>  <p>  The National Training Fund is being reformed to make it more labour market focused, responsive to skills needs and providing additional investment in Further and Higher Education. Progress in implementing reforms has enabled an increase in the NTF levy by 0.1% respectively in both 2018 and 2019, with a commitment to a further 0.1% increase in 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department and the HEA are currently reforming the model by which funding is allocated to our higher education institutions.  The independent panel&rsquo;s review provides a roadmap for transitioning towards a reformed funding model that is more transparent, consistent across higher education institutions, that incentivises actions in key strategic areas such as research and STEM provision, and supports improved accountability while also respecting institutional autonomy. This will ensure that the additional funding that has been made available for higher education is targeted effectively and that institutions are held accountable for how they use public resources.</p></reply>

The role of the HSCL Coordinator is to work primarily with the salient adults in the child&rsquo;s life, in order to empower them, so that they can better support their children to attend school, participate in education and develop positive attitudes to life-long learning. Central to the HSCL initiative, is the identification of educational needs and the provision of a tailored and proportionate response to those needs, through a range of interventions, which are evidence-based, focused and structured. </p><p>All DEIS Urban Primary and DEIS Post Primary schools are currently included in the HSCL Scheme, which serves 539 schools. The scheme is delivered by 416 full-time HSCL Coordinators who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils.<b></b></p><p>The impact of socio-economic factors on educational outcomes can be different between urban and rural settings and we need to take account of that. While urban and rural disadvantage share many characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment and poor housing conditions, as such disadvantage in a rural context does not have the same impact on educational performance. The Performance Report from the National Assessments of English Reading and Mathematics (NAERM), 2014 highlighted the gap that exists between DEIS urban Band 1 schools and pupils in other schools in both reading and maths. Performance in rural DEIS schools is about the same as the national average, while performance in DEIS Band 2 primary schools has improved substantially according to the 2014 National Assessments. Assessments of reading and mathematics performance in DEIS rural primary schools show that students in these schools in some cases perform better than rural non-DEIS schools and at the same level as their counterparts in urban non-DEIS schools. </p><p>My Department's objective in implementing DEIS Plan 2017 is to have the maximum possible impact on providing opportunities for students most at risk of disadvantage.  To achieve this, additional resources must be targeted as closely as possible at those students with the greatest need in terms of concentrated levels of disadvantage.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that Rural DEIS primary schools continue to be supported through the DEIS programme with a range of additional supports, including grant aid in the form of a DEIS grant, enhanced book grant, access to the DEASP School Meals Programme and priority access for teachers to a range of professional development programmes as well as the Incredible Years and Friends programmes.</p><p>My Department has no plans at present to extend this Scheme beyond DEIS Schools.</p></reply>

The objective of the Scheme is to allow participating schools, following consultation with their local communities, to seek to achieve Gaeltacht School Recognition over a 5 year period on the basis of the implementation of specific language-based criteria, including the implementation of a total-immersion approach and the development of action plans by schools.</p>  <p>  To encourage participation in the Scheme by schools, a comprehensive information pack outlining the benefits of immersion education and bilingualism was sent to schools for dissemination to school communities, including parents and teachers. The information pack was developed by the Gaeltacht Education Unit in the Department in collaboration with An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta (COGG), Gaeloideachas, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  </p>  <p>  In April 2017, all schools in Gaeltacht language-planning areas, including the primary school in question, were invited to participate in the Scheme. The Scheme has been welcomed by Gaeltacht communities and well-received in Gaeltacht schools. This is evident from the high participation rates in the Scheme. 106 or 80% of primary schools and 28 or 96% of post-primary schools in the Gaeltacht have opted to participate in the Scheme.  The primary school referred to by the Deputy joined the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme in June 2017 and submitted its action plan to the Gaeltacht Education Unit for review in January 2018. </p>  <p>  Each participating school&rsquo;s action plans for improvement was reviewed by An tAonad um Oideachas Gaeltachta in February 2018 and feedback was provided to each individual school. This enabled each participating school, including the school in question, to access additional resources from September 2018. These resources include access to a grant to purchase Irish-medium teaching resources, additional language-teaching hours (an additional 7.5 hours per week in the case of the primary school concerned), additional continuing professional development delivered by COGG, and additional advisory visits provided by the Inspectorate.  </p>  <p>  The additional language support hours (over and above the normal staffing allocation), allocated to primary schools participating in the Scheme from September 2018, was based on the enrolment figures recorded in the previous year, which is in line with Department norms. Schools at primary level, were given the option to combine these additional language support hours with other primary schools in the locality to form clusters, which would allow for the creation of a temporary part-time teaching post that would be shared by the primary schools in the particular cluster. The primary school concerned was also given this option.</p>  <p>  The general staffing allocation arrangements for 2018/19 for all primary schools, including the school in question, are set out in Circular 10/2018. The staffing arrangements allow for more favourable retention rates in Gaeltacht schools than in other schools. Appendix A of Circular 10/2018 sets out the criteria for the current school year:   www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/Teacher-Allocations/Teacher-Allocations-Primary.html.</p>  <p>  The staffing allocation arrangements for 2019/20 will be published early in 2019.</p></reply>

In December 2014, the Government authorised the SCA to offer &ldquo;out of court&rdquo; settlements to persons taking cases of school child sexual abuse against the State where their cases come within the terms of the ECHR judgment in the O&rsquo;Keeffe case and are not statute barred.</p><p>The State&rsquo;s approach to out-of-court settlement offers in this situation is based on its interpretation of the scope of the European Court&rsquo;s judgment.That interpretation is that the ruling applies to cases involving sexual abuse of a school child by a school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority made prior to the introduction of the Department of Education child protection guidelines issued to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively.  In addition, the case must not be statute barred. </p><p>Justice Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill was appointed by my predecessor in November 2017 to act as an independent assessor in relation to determinations of the SCA on eligibility of applicants to the ex-gratia scheme. </p><p>Following an initial submission on &lsquo;whether the imposition of the condition which required that there had to be evidence of a prior complaint of child sexual abuse on the part of the employee in question to the school authority (or a school authority in which the employee has previously worked), to establish eligibility for a payment under the ex gratia scheme, is consistent with and a correct implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe v. Ireland', Mr Justice O'Neill invited a further submission to address in particular &lsquo;the legal status and/or legal effect in domestic law, of decisions/determinations of the Committee of Ministers in relation to the implementation/enforcement of judgments of the ECtHR.  &rsquo; </p><p>Both submissions can be accessed on the Department's website.Mr Justice O&rsquo;Neill has invited solicitors representing applicants for assessment and other third parties for their views on the latest submission<i>. </i></p></reply>

Within the schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. The terms and conditions of employment are a matter for agreement between the school and the individual employee and my Department has no role in this.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently made significant efforts to improve the pay of school secretaries who are employed using capitation grant assistance. In 2015 my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries on negotiations and agreed to enter an independent arbitration process on the issue. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p>  <p>  With regard to bus drivers, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, and issues regarding the terms and conditions and employment status of bus drivers under that scheme is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p></reply>

The standard approach on school building projects is to schedule such site meetings on a fortnightly basis through the construction period. </p>  <p>  Separate to the role of Employer&rsquo;s Representative, which is an external party appointed by the Department under the Public Works Contract, the Department&rsquo;s own technical staff act as client liaison on school building projects constructed under the Design &amp;amp; Build process.  The responsibilities of the client liaison include reporting on progress to the Department; bringing any potential programme delays to the attention of the Department; keeping the school community awaiting completion of the building informed of progress; involving the School Authorities in selecting of internal colour schemes, and ensuring that the contractor is aware of any particular project or school requirements. The client liaison is not involved in the certification of the works.</p>  <p>  Under the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations introduced in 2014, an Assigned Certifier must be appointed.  Since 2014, the Department has appointed an independent qualified third party to act as Assigned Certifier on all Design and Build school projects. </p>  <p>  On school projects designed by the Employer, the lead Architect on the design team usually acts as the Assigned Certifier.</p>  <p>  The Assigned Certifier coordinates and implements an inspection plan through the construction process. </p>  <p>  At project completion, the Assigned Certifier gathers the ancillary certificates, which are provided by the contractor, its subcontractors and design team, and executes a Certificate of Compliance on Completion. </p>  <p>  The Assigned Certifier is not, however, responsible for the supervision of the builder.</p>  <p>  Since September 2017, in addition to the Assigned Certifier, the Department now appoints a full-time resident Clerk of Works on all major school construction projects. The role of a Clerk of Works is to represent the interests of the client with regard to ensuring that the quality of both materials and workmanship is in accordance with the architect&rsquo;s/engineer&rsquo;s drawings and specifications.

It aims to make a contribution to meeting the key challenges facing Europe to boost growth and jobs and to foster social equity and inclusion. Erasmus+ will provide opportunities for over 4 million Europeans to study, train, gain work experience and volunteer abroad. The Programme aims to boost skills and employability, while supporting the modernisation of education, training and youth systems. The programme is of huge significance to Ireland, with an allocation of &euro;169m over the seven year duration. The funding for 2017 was in excess of &euro;19m with significant increases expected annually to 2020. </p>  <p>  The section of the Erasmus+ 2019 programme guide referred to, relates to the sector skills alliances supporting the design and delivery of joint vocational training curricula, programmes and teaching and training methodologies, drawing on evidence of trends in a specific economic sector and skills needed in order to perform in one or more professional fields. These actions under Erasmus+ are managed on a centralised basis by the Erasmus Executive Agency in Brussels.</p>  <p>  The HEA and L&eacute;argas, as National Agencies for Erasmus+, are responsible for administering de-centralised funding, and therefore have no role in allocating funding under the section of the programme guide that the Deputy refers to.  </p>  <p>  The EU provides funding for education, training and skills development of its citizens, many areas of which are transversal in nature that may be applied to many areas of employment and enterprise.  It is for each Member State to identify its own priorities in its education and training policies, and to apply EU funding accordingly.  The funding of such education, training and upskilling seeks to improve the employability and competitiveness of EU citizens and does not imply any support for particular downstream uses of those skills or qualifications in the labour market.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's reference to the fact that Ireland is a neutral state, the Irish Government is fully committed to Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding policy of military neutrality, which is characterised by non-participation in military alliances. </p></reply>

Within the schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently made significant efforts to improve the pay of school secretaries who are employed using capitation grant assistance.  In 2015 my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries on negotiations and agreed to enter an independent arbitration process on the issue.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p></reply>

Since 2014, the Department has appointed an independent qualified third party to act as Assigned Certifier on all Design and Build school projects. </p>  <p>  On school projects designed by the Employer, the lead Architect on the design team usually acts as the Assigned Certifier.  The Assigned Certifier coordinates and implements an inspection plan through the construction process.  </p>  <p>  At project completion, the Assigned Certifier gathers the ancillary certificates, which are provided by the contractor, its subcontractors and design team, and executes a Certificate of Compliance on Completion. </p>  <p>  The Assigned Certifier is not, however, responsible for the supervision of the builder. </p>  <p>  Since September 2017, in addition to the Assigned Certifier, the Department now appoints a full-time resident Clerk of Works on all major school construction projects to be on-site daily</p>  <p>  The role of a Clerk of Works is to represent the interests of the client with regard to ensuring that the quality of both materials and workmanship is in accordance with the architect&rsquo;s/engineer&rsquo;s drawings and specifications.  This includes inspection of materials and workmanship through the construction process.</p>  <p>  Separate to the role of Employer&rsquo;s Representative, which is an external party appointed by the Department under the Public Works Contract, the Department&rsquo;s own technical staff act as client liaison on school building projects constructed under the Design &amp;amp; Build process.  The responsibilities of the client liaison include reporting on progress to the Department; bringing any potential programme delays to the attention of the Department; keeping the school community awaiting completion of the building informed of progress; involving the School Authorities in selecting of internal colour schemes, and ensuring that the contractor is aware of any particular project or school requirements. </p>  <p>  The client liaison is not involved in the certification of the works. It is important to make a distinction between completion and compliance - it is the responsibility of the contractor and/or designer to ensure compliance with building standards.</p></reply>

The report provides an overview of EU level data and research and includes a country level report prepared by the National Womens Council of Ireland.  It reported for example that in Ireland 11% of women students surveyed have been subjected to unwanted sexual contact, 5% were rape survivors with further 3% survivors of attempted rape, and 31% of women reported feeling harassed.</p><p>All of our publically funded third level institutions provide a range of student-support services, including counselling and health services to their students.  In conjunction with these services, the third level institutions support the student unions in their campaigns and initiatives on sexual health for the students. </p><p>In recent years a number of the third level institutions have established sexual consent programmes and workshops for their students.  These programmes and workshops have a significant positive impact on the students.  On 4<sup>th</sup>October 2018 the Minister for State for Higher Education brought together representatives from the higher education institutions, students unions and other stakeholders for a meeting on consent and tackling sexual violence in third level education.  The Minister is examining the issues that were discussed at the meeting, and is establishing a working group to devise a toolkit of appropriate initiatives / interventions that would be made available to the Higher Education Institutions to deploy within their institutions. </p></reply>

The LCA programme is a two-year Leaving Certificate programme aimed at preparing students for adult and working life.  The programme sets out to recognise the talents of all students and to provide opportunities for developing personal responsibility, self-esteem and self-knowledge, and to help students apply what they learn to the real world.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility and choice of each individual school to decide to put in place the LCA programme, based on the educational needs and interests of their students.  It is also for schools to decide on the admittance of a student to the programme in their school. Schools are encouraged to provide maximum access to these options and to have clear procedures in place regarding how the available places are allocated to students.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting this programme, which is appropriate for members of the student cohort whose needs, aptitudes and learning styles are not fully catered for by the other two Leaving Certificate programmes (Leaving Cert Established and Leaving Cert Vocational Programme).  That is why I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to consider the LCA, as part of its review of Senior Cycle which is currently underway.

Where, however, a full recovery is made and a teacher wishes to return to teaching, <i>prior to taking up any appointment</i>, fresh medical evidence of fitness from the teacher&rsquo;s current treating physician must be submitted for review by the Occupational Health Service (OHS) engaged by my Department.  </p><p>Where a teacher is deemed by the OHS as fit to teach it is open to him/her to seek a teaching post.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Skerries is located in the Skerries school planning area which is currently served by one post-primary school. The following post-primary schools were established in recent years in the adjoining school planning areas of Rush&amp;Lusk and Balbriggan: </p>  <p>  - 1,000 pupil post-primary school established in 2013 to serve the Rush&amp;Lusk school planning area;</p>  <p>  - 700 pupil post-primary school established in 2014 to serve the Balbriggan school planning area; and</p>  <p>  - 700 pupil post-primary school established in 2016 to serve the Balbriggan school planning area.</p>  <p>  The demographic data for the Skerries school planning area indicates that enrolments are projected to peak in 2023 at just over 1,000 post-primary pupils. While there is also an element of additional residential development in this area, it is not of a level that would require a new school. The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. </p>  <p>  My Department has been liaising with the school&rsquo;s patron in relation to an application for additional accommodation at the post-primary school in this school planning area. In this regard, my Department has approved in principle the provision of  additional permanent accommodation consisting of 3 general classrooms, 1  Science Lab, 1 Art room and 3 Special Education Teaching rooms. As an interim arrangement, my Department has also approved the rental of temporary accommodation to the school pending the delivery of the permanent accommodation solution. My Department will continue to work with the patron to address the school&rsquo;s interim and long-term accommodation needs.</p></reply>

For example, the science curriculum aims to enable children to appreciate that people share the environment with animal life and that living things have essential needs for growth. In addition, children explore how to care for and respect animals and how to take action to protect their environment. Through the science curriculum, children also come to recognise that people, plants and animals depend on each other.</p><p>In the course of their work, teachers in different disciplines use various support materials produced by bodies such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Compassion in World Farming and other national Animal Welfare Charities who provide either free primary school programmes to schools or facilitate educational visits from schools.</p><p>At post primary it is a matter for schools to decide which subjects they wish to offer. One of the Leaving Certificate subject options available is Biology. Through the study of Biology students explore the diversity of life and the inter-relationships between organisms and their environment. They become aware of the use of living organisms and their products to enhance human health and the environment. </p><p>There is a Level 2 Short course for Junior Cycle: A Personal Project: Caring for Animals. This short course builds on and promotes the development of a range of personal, social and practical skills in the context of learning about an animal of special interest to the student. As well as content knowledge, students develop essential skills such as those of communication and language; thinking and reasoning; labelling; classifying; comparison and inferring. Knowledge, skills and attitudes for life are developed through links with the community, creative projects, numeracy, communication and literacy.</p></reply>

Details in respect of each are outlined below.</p><p><b>Civil Legal Aid</b></p><p>The provision of civil legal aid in the State is delivered by the Legal Aid Board pursuant to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2017. The Board operates 30 full time law centres and a number of part time law centres in Ireland. The Board also provides mediation services to help separating couples to negotiate their own agreement.</p><p>The majority of the Board's income consists of a grant received from the Department of Justice and Equality.  This funding is used to provide the Board's services in all its offices across the country, as well as the support services provided to law centres centrally from the Board's head office.  </p><p>It is not possible to extract and isolate the total cost of civil legal aid in any one office/county in a given year as it would be necessary to devise a basis on which to attribute, to each county, all expenditure incurred by the Board centrally.  Complexities may also arise at local level with regard to the delivery of civil legal aid, for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply to Ennis Law Centre.  Also, in a case where two parties to a dispute seek the services of the Board at one law centre, one party will be required to engage with a different law centre, which may be in a neighbouring county.</p><p>Funding provided to the Legal Aid Board by my Department for the last seven years is provided in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Budget Allocation &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>40.275</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>38.988</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>34.838</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>32.471</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>32.574</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>33.759</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32.922</td></tr></table></p><p>The following table sets out the number of cases handled in Legal Aid Board law centres, and the number of cases referred by the Legal Aid Board to private solicitors each year in the period 2012-2017.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>Cases handled in law centres*</td><td>17,652</td><td>17,304</td><td>18,338</td><td>17,959</td><td>17,213</td><td>18,170</td></tr><tr><td>Referred to solicitors panels**</td><td>5,082</td><td>5,640</td><td>5,241</td><td>5,534</td><td>5,923</td><td>8,532</td></tr></table></p><p>*Cases handled in law centres include international protection (asylum) cases in 2017 only. Comparable data in relation to such cases is not available in previous years.</p><p>**Referrals to solicitors panels include Abhaile cases in 2016 and 2017 only. The Abhaile scheme started on 22<sup>nd</sup>July 2016.</p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings. Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid. Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.</p><p>Expenditure on criminal legal aid since 2012 is set out in the Table below along with data provided by the Courts Service regarding the number of legal aid certificates granted in the District Court.  It should be noted the number of certificates does not equate to the number of persons granted criminal legal aid as more than one certificate may be granted to any one person.  The number of legal aid certificates granted by the District Court in October 2018 is not yet available. </p><p>Statistics are not compiled in such a manner as to readily identify expenditure on a county by county basis<b>.</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number   of Certificates Granted</th><th>Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>49,639</td><td>&euro;50.534m</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>49,843</td><td>&euro;50.863m</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>51,128</td><td>&euro;49.890m</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>53,937</td><td>&euro;50.879m</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>55,617</td><td>&euro;52,998m</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>64,181</td><td>&euro;58,139m</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>52,636   (to end of September)</td><td>49,230m   (to end of October)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available and the project did not proceed.  In the decade since the original plan, international research has tended towards smaller prisons within reach of support communities as the best option for rehabilitation.  In addition, in light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton Hall, significant capital investment has been made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years to upgrade accommodation and eliminate the practice of slopping out.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Thornton Hall site which is fully serviced and adjacent to Dublin airport remains in my Department&rsquo;s ownership and in recent years a working group, which included representatives from the OPW, considered future use options for the site. This included discussions with Fingal County Council.  More recently, the site has also been flagged to the Department of Housing and Local Government, and to the Land Development Agency. As such, the site will be considered both in the context of broader State requirements for land assets and future requirements in relation to detention of prisoners.</p></reply>

As you know, the announcement was greeted by sustained applause and a standing ovation in the Oireachtas.</p><p>This recognition of the distinct heritage, culture, and identity of Travellers and of their special place in Irish society was both symbolically and socially important in our work to overcome the economic marginalisation and discrimination of members of the Traveller community.</p><p>Following this statement, on 13<sup>th</sup>June 2017, I launched the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2021. This Strategy contains 149 actions, grouped under ten themes, which are as follows:</p><p>- Cultural Identity; </p><p>- Education; </p><p>- Employment; </p><p>- Children and Youth; </p><p>- Health; </p><p>- Gender Equality; </p><p>- Anti-discrimination and Equality; </p><p>- Accommodation; </p><p>- Traveller and Roma Communities; </p><p>- Public Services </p><p>I chair a Steering Group which has the responsibility for monitoring and achieving progress on the implementation of the Strategy since its publication. The Steering Group consists of representatives of the Traveller and Roma communities, as well as of representatives of relevant Government Departments and Agencies. </p><p>These meetings provide an opportunity to review progress and to drive forward implementation of the Strategy. To date, work has been progressed on approximately 130 of the Actions in the Strategy. The Steering Group continues to monitor progress on these Actions and to focus on actions where sufficient progress has not yet been made.</p><p>In response to a number of priority actions in the Strategy, 4 sub-committees were set up to report back to the Steering Group: </p><p>- One of these sub-committees has been formed in the Department on the issue of data collection on ethnic grounds for equality purposes. Information was collected from Government Departments on what ethnic data is already being collected, as well as whether there are plans to collect this data where not already being done.</p><p>- A second sub-committee has been formed to deal with the issue of the retention of Traveller and Roma children in education. A proposal was jointly agreed between the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Education and Skills, and TUSLA to implement a pilot project on this issue in 4 different locations with high Traveller and/or Roma populations. Traveller organisations are in agreement with pursuing the proposal, and are keen to follow developments by means of future meetings of this sub-committee. The initiative would involve an increase in resources in each of the pilot locations. It was decided that one pilot of the initiative would be located in each of four TUSLA Education Welfare Services regions &ndash; South, South East &ndash; Wexford; West/North West &ndash; Tuam urban area; North Dublin/North Leinster &ndash; Coolock, Ballymun and Finglas; and South Dublin/Kildare/West Wicklow &ndash; Tallaght, Clondalkin.</p><p>- The third sub-committee was set up to deal with the problem of feuding in the Traveller Community. Resulting from that, an increase of funding for the Traveller Mediation Service for the expansion of its services was agreed and the expansion is commencing now.</p><p>- The fourth sub-committee has recently been established to look at actions that can be pursued to increase Traveller employment.  This will examine the potential of Traveller entrepreneurship, social enterprise models, apprenticeships etc.</p><p>The membership of the four sub-committees consists of representatives of relevant Government Department and Agency officials as well as of the Traveller and Roma communities who have relevant backgrounds in e.g. education and employment creation in the Traveller communities.</p></reply>

Some of these difficulties had arisen because third party agents had been able to secure multiple appointments through the use of automatic software. </p>  <p>  A set of software fixes was introduced in mid-September to prevent this abuse of the system.  As far as can be determined, this software update has been successful in preventing the block booking of appointments by third party agents.  The system is being regularly monitored in this regard. </p>  <p>  The period September to November is the busiest time for registrations with many student registrations in addition to the usual workload of the office.  A number of measures have been taken to increase the capacity of the office, including the assignment of additional staff to the Registration Office, overtime and opening the office for registrations on most Saturdays and some Sundays. These measures are aimed at ensuring that as many appointments as possible are made available each day. INIS plans to continue these measures at least until December to ensure demand is met.  </p>  <p>  In that regard, I am advised that over 9,600 people were registered with INIS in Dublin in the month of October &ndash; up significantly on the September figure.  I am further advised that to the end of October in excess of 67,000 persons have been registered this year in Dublin representing an increase of 7.5% on the same period  for 2017.  INIS expects to register over well over 80,000 people in Dublin this year.</p>  <p>  Appointments are made available twice daily with over 400 per day released for booking. The system is being kept under review to address any abuses that may emerge.</p></reply>

This usually follows a failed application for some form of immigration permission, where an application for international protection had been refused or where a person arrived in the State illegally and came to the attention of immigration authorities.</p>  <p>   Persons are served with a formal notification of intention to deport, as provided for under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) which sets out the options available to them, namely; to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to a Deportation Order being made or to submit written representations setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made in respect of them.</p>  <p>   The Deputy might wish to note that many persons faced with these options choose to return voluntarily to their country of origin. In fact, in the period between 2011 and mid-October 2018, a total of 2,245 people exercised this option and proceeded to return to their home country, some of them with assistance from the International Organisation for Migration. Clearly there was no requirement to make a Deportation Order in any of those cases.</p>  <p>   During the same period, a total of 9,197 deportations orders were made. The Deputy might note that such an order is only made after a detailed consideration of the individual circumstances of the case, under a variety of prescribed headings, including family and private life rights, and having regard to the prohibition on refoulement.  When a Deportation Order is made and is served, the person concerned is legally obliged to remove themselves from the State and to remain out of the State.  Many persons comply with the Order served on them but may not notify the immigration authorities that they have done so.  Accordingly, it is not always possible for the INIS or the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to know as to whether or not a Deportation Order has been complied with.  It is only when a person served with such an Order fails to remove themselves from the State that the issue of enforced removal arises. During the period between 2011 and October, 2018, a total of 1,857 deportation orders were effected.     </p>  <p>   The Deputy might wish to note that a Deportation Order, once made and served, remains valid and in place unless and until it is formally revoked. Similarly, a person who is recorded as evading deportation, by dint of their non-compliance with a valid Deportation Order, is liable to arrest and detention to facilitate their deportation from the State.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it recognises that every community, either urban or rural, has its own concerns and expectations. The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Coolock Garda Station forms part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Division on 30 September 2018 was 705, of whom 108 were assigned to Coolock Garda Station. Of those assigned to Coolock Garda Station 7 are categorised as Community Garda&iacute;. There are also 40 Garda Reserves and 47 Garda civilian staff attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014 almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 35 have been assigned to Coolock Garda station. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College and we are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018. </p><p>With the moratorium on recruitment and the closure of the training college Garda numbers dropped in all Divisions. We are still in the process of rebuilding to the numbers in the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before the economic crisis. The numbers in Coolock have been steadily increasing since 2015 and as the accelerated recruitment continues into 2019 I am confident that the numbers of Garda&iacute; stationed in Coolock will soon reach the pre crisis levels.</p><p>The recent report published by the Commission on the Future of Policing recommends a new district policing model, were all Garda personnel at district level, sworn and non-sworn, should work as a single district policing team, to solve problems affecting community safety, reduce crime and prevent harm. I, alongside my Departmental Officials, are currently analysing the Report and my officials are currently engaging in consultations with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the policing oversight bodies and the relevant Departments, in order to inform my substantive response and high-level implementation plan that I intend to bring to Government by December.</p><p>The information in relation to the number of Community Garda&iacute; by Rank attached to the Community Policing Unit at Coolock Garda Station as of 30 September 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is as set out in the table.</p><p><b>Number categorised as Community  Garda Coolock Garda Station  30 September 2018</b><table><tr><th>Station</th><th>Insp</th><th>Sergeant</th><th>Garda</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Coolock</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>7</td></tr></table></p><p>The number of Garda&iacute; by rank assigned to Coolock Garda Station from 2009 to Sept 2018 is as set out in the table. </p><p><i>Number of Garda&iacute; assigned to Coolock from 2009 - Sept 2018</i><table><tr><th>Coolock</th><th>GD</th><th>SG</th><th>IN</th><th>SU</th><th>CS</th><th>AC</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>Sep-18</td><td>93</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-17</td><td>90</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-16</td><td>88</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-15</td><td>87</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-14</td><td>90</td><td>14</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>109</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-13</td><td>94</td><td>13</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-12</td><td>97</td><td>12</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-11</td><td>98</td><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-10</td><td>101</td><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Dec-09</td><td>104</td><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td>123</td></tr></table></p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the link: <i>.</i></p></reply>

Further, the Commissioner is responsible for directing and controlling and managing generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As such, the management of Garda resources are a matter for the Commissioner, in light of his identified operational demands. </p>  <p>  The resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2018 of more than &euro;1.6 billion. The allocation to the Garda Vote for 2019 has been further increased to a total of &euro;1.76 billion, representing an increase of over 6% over the initial allocation for 2018.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the 2019 allocation includes capital provision of some &euro;92 million, representing an increase of over &euro;30 million as compared to 2018.  This will facilitate investment of &euro;65 million in Garda ICT, a further &euro;10 million investment in the Garda fleet and an investment of &euro;17 million in the Garda estate. This capital investment is a key enabler in the ongoing reform programme. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to determine how these resources can best be deployed.  I understand, in that regard, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure their optimum use. </p>  <p>  In general terms, the provision of &euro;65 million for ICT investment will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community and deliver on reform.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the specific list of projects to be undertaken in 2019 has yet to be finalised and as a result it is not possible to provide a list of specific projects at this time. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the budget of &euro;10 million available for the purchase and fit-out of Garda vehicles in 2019 will enable the replacement of vehicles reaching end of life or beyond economic repair.  While the funds made available are expected to enable an increase in the size of the Garda fleet, I am informed that the specific number of additional vehicles and the mix of types and the fit-out required will be determined by the Commissioner in accordance with operational priorities. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Garda estate, the Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the &euro;17 million allocated to the Garda estate will support a number of projects including commencement of works on the new Garda facility at Military Road to replace Harcourt Square, the refurbishment of the Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station (on which works have commenced in 2018), as well as supporting continued progress in delivery of the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021.</p></reply>

Phase One has now been completed, with Divisional Protective Services Units established in three Divisions, in the DMR West, Cork City, and Louth Division.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that additional Divisional Protective Services Bureaus are now in the process of being established in DMR South Central; Waterford; Kerry; Kilkenny/Carlow; Limerick and Galway Garda Divisions.  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it is intended that Divisional Protective Services Bureaus will be established in all remaining Garda Divisions before the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that this initiative is being managed collaboratively between the Garda National Protective Services Bureau and each Divisional Officer. The pilot will inform the full roll-out to each Garda Division, by assessing and evaluating the Units initially selected including with reference to for example geographical size and population profile.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that matters relating to Garda accommodation are progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  However I can confirm that, to enable the Commissioner and Garda&iacute; to perform their functions, Budget 2019 provides an unprecedented level of public funding of &euro;1.76 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019. This includes an increase in the Garda capital allocation from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT, a further &euro;10 million investment in the Garda fleet and &euro;17 million in the Building Programme. This investment clearly demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.</p>  <p>  The provision of suitable accommodation for protective services units is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the OPW. The manner in which accommodation is delivered varies depending on the requirements for each location. </p></reply>

These are companies registered under the Companies Acts, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development and which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of the common areas of that development.</p>  <p>  Section 19(1) of the Act provides that an OMC must establish a sinking fund for the purpose of discharging expenditure reasonably incurred on the refurbishment,  improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development concerned.  Section 19(3) obliges the owner of each unit in the multi-unit development to make payment to the sinking fund of the amount of contribution fixed in respect of the unit concerned. Section 19(5) provides that the amount of the contribution to be paid to the sinking fund in respect of a particular year shall be &euro;200.00 or such other amount as may be agreed by the members of the OMC at a meeting.</p>  <p>  Thus, while there is a legal requirement on each OMC to establish and maintain a sinking fund, the determination of the annual contribution to the fund is a matter for each OMC. In the absence of such a determination, a contribution of &euro;200.00 shall continue to apply. Section 19(1)(a) provides that expenditure may be incurred from the sinking fund in order to obtain advice from a suitably qualified person in relation to the likely reasonable costs of refurbishment, improvements or other expenditure of a non-recurring nature.</p>  <p>  As regards the payment of agreed sinking fund contributions, section 22 of the 2011 Act provides that such contributions may be recovered by the OMC as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  While I have no specific plans to review operation of the Multi-unit Developments Act 2011 at present, operation of the Act's provisions is kept under general review by my Department. </p></reply>

Section 16 of the International Protection Act 2015 provides for a protection applicant to remain in the State while their protection application is being examined. Such permission stays in place during the determination of their claim by the International Protection Office and any subsequent appeals bodies or the Courts.  </p>  <p>  All applicants for international protection are interviewed and their cases are individually assessed. The circumstances of each individual case is assessed having regard to both the subjective elements (the applicant&rsquo;s own account or personal history) and objective elements (up-to-date information on the applicant&rsquo;s country or place of origin). Supporting documentation submitted by applicants is also taken into account.  Country of Origin information is obtained from a variety of legitimate sources such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Amnesty International and other NGOs, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the US State Department and the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board. Applicants may appeal a recommendation by the International Protection Office that they are not in need of international protection to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. It is also important to note that free legal aid is available to applicants for international protection. All stages of the process may be the subject of additional judicial reviews.   </p>  <p>  When after these extensive procedures an applicant has been found not to be in need of international protection, that person is no longer an asylum seeker and in need of  international protection.  </p>  <p>  Failed asylum seekers are also considered by the Minister under section 49 of the International Protection Act 2015 as to whether the person should be given a permission to remain on other grounds, including for humanitarian reasons.  A refoulement consideration must also be carried out under section 50(1) of the Act prior to a deportation consideration. This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Clearly, no person is returned to their country of origin, or their place of former habitual residence, where there is a credible risk to their life or freedom </p>  <p>  Only after all of these matters have been considered, and the appropriate evidence-based conclusions drawn, can a decision to deport a person whose application has failed. The Deputy can be assured that all matters advanced by a person facing deportation are considered in detail before the ultimate decision, to deport or not to deport, is taken. </p></reply>

If the conviction is eligible to be spent it becomes spent once 7 years has passed from the date of conviction.  I am further advised that the effect of a spent conviction is that a person would not be penalised for failing to disclose a conviction that is spent. The fact that a conviction may be a spent conviction does not mean it ceases to be part of the person's criminal record. However, disclosure is required in certain circumstances including for example for specified work, such as with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces, and for public service vehicle, private security, taxi and firearm licences.  If someone has been convicted of fraud, deceit or dishonesty in respect of a claim under a policy of insurance or a policy of assurance, they have to disclose that conviction on any insurance or assurance proposal or form.</p>  <p>  Arising from this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not required to expunge the details of such offences from PULSE.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the Garda vetting procedure, the Deputy will appreciate that the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the Garda National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults. It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that disclosures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for persons not seeking work with children or vulnerable adults are made in accordance with Section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016.  I am informed that it is normal practice, as part of such disclosures, to include particulars of the criminal record, if any, relating to the person, or a statement that there is no criminal record in relation to the person.  A disclosure shall not contain details of any convictions which are "spent" as provided for in Section 6 of the 2016 Act subject to the provisions mentioned above.  </p></reply>

Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.</p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006).  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must-</p><p>-  be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>-  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p><p>-  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment. </p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities.  I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.</p><p>Nonetheless, my Department is engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office has confirmed as recently as May of this year that it does not have any concerns on the legislative basis for CCTV.  However it is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV.  We expect findings from this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities.</p><p>Finally, I would recall that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In pursuance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department.

The Government's Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021 provides &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda fleet, to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet, in addition to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the period 2013 to 2015.

Once fitted out, these vehicles will be allocated under pilot conditions.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been involved in the Public Sector Energy Reporting Programme since 2011 and has achieved a 25.7% improvement in energy efficiency up to 2017, against the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) 33% energy efficiency target by 2020. In relation to the fleet, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the majority of efficiencies have been achieved from the conversion from petrol to diesel.</p></reply>

Sometimes this comes at the end of an earlier process whereby an application for one form or another of immigration permission has been considered and not granted.  Other considerations under Section 3 arise when persons have been found to be in the State illegally and have never engaged with the immigration authorities as required by law.</p>  <p>  Before any decision is made, a detailed consideration of all aspects of the case is carried out.  Written representations can be made and a full consideration is carried out as prescribed in section 3(6) of the 1999 Act. This includes: the age of the person, the duration of their residence in the State, their family and domestic circumstances, the nature of their connection with the State, if any, their employment (including self-employment) record and employment (including self-employment) prospects, their character and conduct, including any criminal convictions, any humanitarian issues associated with their case, the common good and considerations of national security and public policy.</p>  <p>  This detailed consideration must also include an assessment of that person&rsquo;s right to a family and a private life, as provided for under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and regard must be had for the constitutional rights of any Irish citizens directly associated with the case. A refoulement consideration must also be carried out, essentially to consider the safety of returning the relevant person to their country of origin, having regard for the political and human rights conditions prevailing in that country of origin at the material time. Only after all these matters have been considered, and evidence-based conclusions drawn, can a final decision be made.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that no two cases of this nature will be the same in terms of their complexity and accordingly the duration of processing times will vary.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) give precedence to certain case types to ensure that, insofar as it is possible to do so, the cases requiring priority attention are given such attention. This includes cases requiring early and humanitarian attention.   </p>  <p>  Given the life-changing consequences for the persons impacted by these decisions, it is essential that the correct and appropriate decision be reached in each case rather than a quick decision be made to satisfy a particular processing time-frame.  Obviously, it is the objective that all cases are processed as quickly as possible and in that regard, I can advise the Deputy that well over 1,000 such cases are decided upon each year.  This forms just part of the overall caseload of INIS who process in the region of 250,000 cases each year.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding, processing times are on a par and in many cases have been significantly improved upon compared to those at the corresponding date last year.  </p><p>The processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors, such as the volumes and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods - now just coming off the busiest time of the year for visa applications generally - seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.  </p><p>In relation to applications under the Free Movement Directive (2004/38/EC), there had been an exponential increase from the second quarter of 2015 in the number of such applications.  That gave rise to a caseload of around 10,500 applications which had to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive were detected and dealt with appropriately. Considerable progress has been made in that regard with the majority of these applications now processed.  </p><p>The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategies, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda Resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p><p>The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues.When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with Local Management during which all factors are taken into consideration.

To support the Commissioner in this recruitment, I have also secured funding in Budget 2019 which facilitates the recruitment of up to 800 more Garda&iacute; next year.

The Act distinguishes between the entitlement to citizenship by birth and descent and to the acquisition of citizenship through the naturalisation process. Following a referendum of the Irish people, the 27th amendment to the Constitution changed the situation in relation to entitlement to Irish Citizenship. As a result, Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004. The changes came into effect on 1 January 2005. As of that date a person born in the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been resident in the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth (periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence).</p>  <p>  Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State. This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation. </p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to amend the relevant legislation at this time.</p>  <p>  In determining whether to make a deportation order under the Immigration Act, 1999, I am required to consider a number of factors including the age, duration of residence and the family and domestic circumstances of the individual as well as any connections with the State and humanitarian considerations that arise.

Not every person accepts this offer and there is no obligation on any person to do so. Some persons may avail of accommodation with friends and / or family or may have means of their own.</p>  <p>  A person who does not need accommodation and related services immediately on arrival in Ireland may seek to obtain these services at a later date.</p>  <p>  In early September 2018, there was a sudden increase in demand for accommodation and priority had to be given to families and other vulnerable people arriving into Ireland. The numbers who did not initially receive an offer of accommodation are relatively small (approximately 20 persons) and RIA has now offered accommodation to any of those in this situation who contacted it subsequently.</p>  <p>   Since that time additional accommodation has been made available to RIA and all newly arrived protection applications who have requested accommodation have been so provided.</p>  <p>  As of Sunday evening, 28 October 2018, 5,848 persons were accommodated throughout the State. This is from a contracted capacity of 6,051 with just over 160 spaces unavailable due to family configurations etc., and 60 spaces available for new applicants. </p>  <p>  To address ongoing demands, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department continues to work actively to identify and contract suitable accommodation. This will inevitably involve opening of new accommodation centres across the country.</p>  <p>  Quite separate to this, RIA is also engaged in an open competitive process to establish a framework of accommodation centres from which we can draw down accommodation as and when needed over the coming years. </p></reply>

My officials have written to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seek out the further information sought by the Deputy and I will write to the Deputy when further information is received.</p>  <p>  In the interim, it is helpful to set out some general information regarding the obligation on those who are convicted of certain sexual offences to provide certain information to Garda&iacute;. While the term 'Sex Offenders Register' is commonly used in Ireland, there is in fact no such register and the term is not included in any section of the Sex Offenders Act 2001. </p>  <p>  The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons.  Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements. These notification requirements apply automatically upon conviction and the duration is set by reference to the sentence imposed. </p>  <p>  All offenders subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State. </p>  <p>  Of the nine prosecutions to which the question refers, seven resulted in a sentence of more than two years which would have placed the person under an indefinite notification requirement, and two resulted in either a fine or an entirely suspended sentence, which would have placed the person under a notification requirement for five years.</p>  <p>  As indicated above, my officials have contacted the Garda authorities in order to confirm that in these individual instances the notification requirements were complied with and appropriately monitored. I will write to the Deputy to further update him when more information becomes available.</p></reply>

Gaming licences (as well as individual licences for gaming and amusement machines) are issued by the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.  </p>  <p>  As for casino type gambling, private members' clubs offering gaming facilities and services are required to register with the Department of Justice and Equality under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. 37 such clubs are registered with the Department of Justice and Equality. These private members' clubs are designated persons under the 2010 Act and are subject to compliance monitoring by the Department of Justice and Equality's Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Unit. This involves onsite inspections by authorised officers to ensure that effective anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing policies and procedures are in place in the club and the designated person is adhering to its obligations under the Act, including that staff have been appropriately trained in this area. </p>  <p>  However, I am happy to update the Deputy on future plans to address the issues raised by him from the perspective of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Firstly, the Government has prepared amendments to update the 1956 Act.  The Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The amendments proposed under this Bill address certain deficiencies with regard to the conduct of activities regulated under the 1956 Act, and provide for the modernisation of that Act by way of, among other matters, updating stake and prize limits and standardising the minimum gambling/betting age at 18. I hope to receive a text for publication by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Secondly, the Government, on 10 January 2018, approved a number of proposals to update the 2013 General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill.  Critically, the Government approved a proposal to establish an independent regulatory authority for the gambling industry in Ireland. The 2013 proposal had been to have the regulatory function essentially contained within the Department. </p>  <p>  To advance the review of the 2013 General Scheme,  I chaired an Interdepartmental Working Group on Gambling, comprising all stakeholder Departments and the Office of the Attorney General. The Group met on 5 occasions between February and June of this year and reviewed all of the provisions of the 2013 Scheme, including those relating to casinos and the licensing of gaming machines, as well as other relevant developments since. </p>  <p>  The Group is currently preparing its report, which I hope to bring to Government for consideration as soon as possible.  It is expected that the report will include, among other matters, recommendations on the future approach to be taken to the regulation of casino type gambling and other gaming activities.</p></reply>

A Senior Counsel has been appointed deal with two of them: to advise on assistance to be given to applicants who lack capacity to accept an award and to review cases where there is a dispute in relation to the length of stay in a Magdalen Institution.  Her work is  on these issues is progressing.  A third recommendation to do with establishing guidance on the development and operation of future redress schemes is currently being examined by an Interdepartmental group led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The fourth - and principal - recommendation is that the Magdalen scheme should be applied to women who worked in the laundry of one of the 12 'Magdalen' Institutions specified in the 2013 Scheme, but who were resident in one of 14 adjoining institutions. An interdepartmental group which included the Office of the Attorney General was established to determine the manner in which this recommendation should be implemented having regard to the recommendations of the Quirke Report.  Following on from this exercise, in May 2018 the Government accepted the Group&rsquo;s recommendation that the scheme should apply to the cohort of women covered by the Ombudsman's recommendation as follows: that a &quot;general&quot; payment will be made for the period of residency in the adjoining institution in addition to a &quot;work&quot; payment for the period of work in the laundry of the 'Magdalen&quot; Institution.  </p><p>That decision required some legal and technical work to be completed before applications could be processed.This included the preparation of an addendum to the terms of the scheme.  Officials in my Department are working closely with the Office of the Attorney General and I expect the addendum to be finalised imminently.  Once this has been finalised the addendum will be published and processing of applications will commence. Officials will also contact applicants to keep them informed of developments.</p></reply>

Both these categories have as their legal basis section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, which deals with CCTV for the purpose of securing public order and safety in public places. </p>  <p>  Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006.  It may be noted that under the 2005 Act as amended, the power to establish the criteria for community CCTV schemes is a matter for the Policing Authority, by order made with the approval of the Government. </p>  <p>  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.</p>  <p>  As is clear from this legislative basis, the responsibility for approval of any proposed Community CCTV scheme does not rest with me as Minister.  Rather, the relevant approvals are by the local Joint Policing Committee, relevant Local Authority and the Garda Commissioner. The matters raised, such as square footage of cameras proposed to be used in establishment of a new CCTV system and/or the procedures to be adopted by all parties in applying and satisfying the legislative framework, are for those authorities.</p>  <p>  The grant aid scheme administered by my Department is intended to assist groups in funding the establishment of community based CCTV systems in their local areas, with grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system available, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  It will be appreciated that the grant-aid scheme does not and cannot alter the statutory requirements for approval of CCTV systems.  Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address communitycctv@justice.ie</p></reply>

Commencement of the legislation had to be delayed pending the drafting of necessary District Court Rules, which are detailed and technical in nature, and the provision of training to Courts Service staff to facilitate proper implementation of the revised suspended sentencing arrangements. The District Court Rules are currently in the process of being finalised, having regard to legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the legislation was brought forward following a High Court judgment in April 2016 which found certain provisions of section 99 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in relation to the activation of suspended sentences to be unconstitutional. The essential difficulty was the lack of an effective appeal mechanism in respect of a second, triggering conviction prior to referral to the original court for a decision on activation of a suspended sentence. It should be noted, however, that the whole of section 99, which provides for the overall suspended sentencing regime, was not struck down.  This meant that the general power to suspend sentences remained.  It also meant that provisions providing another mechanism for the activation of suspended sentences remained in place, as an alternative to the courts-driven process. This allows a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a probation officer or the governor of a prison to apply to the court for activation of a suspended sentence where a breach of the conditions of the suspension has occurred. This alternative mechanism has therefore remained available to the relevant authorities pending commencement of the amending legislation.</p></reply>

Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and where the positions on offer cannot be reasonably filled from within Ireland, Switzerland and the EEA.</p>  <p>  Access to a high quality, innovative and adaptable talent pool is critical for the sustainable growth of the Irish economy and keeping Ireland competitive. </p>  <p>  Employment permits are part of the response to addressing skills needs likely to continue into the medium term. Employment permit policy has focussed on facilitating the recruitment of highly skilled personnel from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) where skills needs cannot be met by normal recruitment or training.  The Employment Permits system is not orientated towards any particular country or region and almost all non-EEA nationals, including citizens from the Philippines, Brazil and the wider South American region can apply for an employment permit if all conditions are satisfied.</p>  <p>  The system for determining eligibility for employment permits is flexible and responsive to change with the list of eligible occupations reviewed on a bi-annual basis. However, it is not intended as a long-term substitute for upskilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce or sourcing skills from within the EEA. In undertaking any adjustment in the orientation of the system, the interests of the some 210,700 people on the Live Register in Ireland and the 16.5 million unemployed in the EU 28 must be remembered. </p>  <p>  In light of the changing economy and as we continue towards near full employment, it is imperative that the employment permits system is correctly oriented to meet the State&rsquo;s labour market needs.  To that end, I recently published a report reviewing the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system to ensure our policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.  The report confirms that our employment permits system is largely robust with some adjustment required to ensure continued responsiveness, setting out recommendations to be addressed over the short, medium and long term that will ensure that our employment permits system will play its part in supporting Ireland's labour market needs.  </p></reply>

Enterprise development has been central to our success in reducing unemployment from a high of 16% to 5.4% at the end of September - the lowest level in over a decade. </p>  <p>  The Mid East region has seen good progress recently, with an unemployment rate of 5% in 2017, the lowest rate of all the regions. Overall employment figures for the region increased by 32,900 from Q1 2015 to Q2 2018. In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the Mid East of 4% and 6% respectively.   </p>  <p>  I am happy to say that in Budget 2019, I secured an increase in my Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871 million to &euro;950.2 million.</p>  <p>  This is made up of a record &euro;620 million in capital and &euro;330.2 million in current funding, which includes:</p>  <p>  - an increase of &euro;65 million in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on this year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555 million; and</p>  <p>  - an increase of &euro;14.2 million in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316 million.</p>  <p>  Regional development was one of my three main priorities for Budget 2019 and I approved a range of measures to drive indigenous enterprise development and regional growth. </p>  <p>  I secured additional funding of &euro;5 million in Budget 2019 for the Local Enterprise Offices. This brings the (LEO) capital allocation for 2019 to &euro;27.5 million, a significant increase of 22% on the 2018 figure.</p>  <p>  This additional funding will enable the LEOs to focus on supporting, strengthening and building resilience for commercial start-ups, micro-enterprises and local businesses that will sustain and create good quality jobs in every town and county, including Kildare. The LEOs will work with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This will include a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, to be rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation &euro;2.75 million to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises.</p>  <p>  Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25 million in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence. This new Scheme follows through on our commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. </p>  <p>  In addition, I also secured funding for a new phase of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme out to 2024. The new scheme, which is worth &euro;175 million, will be oriented towards seed and early stage investments, where there is a very clear market failure.</p>  <p>  I announced an additional &euro;1.8 million investment for the Design Craft Council of Ireland (DCCOI) which will assist craft enterprises all over the country to develop and generate additional export sales and online revenue opportunities, increased market diversification so as to underpin sustainable growth. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Future Growth Loan Scheme announced in Budget 2019 will make a fund of up to &euro;300 million available to SMEs for terms of 8-10 years. The scheme will be open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. Finance provided under the scheme will be competitively priced and have favourable terms, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 unsecured. The scheme is expected to launch in early 2019 and will sit alongside the Brexit Loan Scheme as part of the Department&rsquo;s suite of Brexit supports.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, along with Minister Breen, I met with the Chairs of all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees and other regional stakeholders, to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their effectiveness, relevance and impact out to 2020, particularly in light of Brexit. I am pleased with the ambition and quality of the proposals being developed. The refreshed Mid East Region Action Plan for Jobs will enhance the impact and delivery of the supports outlined in Budget 2019, and existing supports, to increase job creation and enterprise development.</p></reply>

FDI flows into the country have been particularly significant in recent years with pronounced growth in total job numbers and investment projects. </p>  <p>  The reduction in FDI in the referenced report concerns the movement of cash assets following the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in late 2017.  While I understand some US firms in Ireland have repatriated such financial resources since that legislation came into force, there has been little discernible impact on their actual operations here.</p>  <p>  I am also confident, despite recent changes to the American taxation system, that US and international firms will continue to locate or expand further in Ireland. Our strengths &ndash; including our pro-enterprise policy environment, highly educated workforce and competitive taxation regime &ndash; remain attractive to international investors. Indeed, the IDA&rsquo;s mid-year results reflect an active and healthy pipeline of investment into the country. The Agency, for example, secured 139 projects in the first six months of this year, compared with 114 in the first half of 2017.  </p>  <p>  The Government is nevertheless very much conscious of our need to remain as competitive as possible in FDI terms. That is why we will continue to invest, for example, in our national infrastructure and take other steps that will help ensure Ireland remains a destination of choice for overseas investors.</p></reply>

My Department has commenced the Quarter 4 2018 review of the lists of occupations for employment permits with a public call for submissions from stakeholders and interest groups requesting changes to the lists. The closing date for receipt of submissions was last Friday 2nd November 2018. Submissions have been received in respect of a range of occupations including the construction sector.</p>  <p>  In order to have an occupation considered for addition to the HSEOL, there would need to be a clear demonstration of current recruitment difficulties and shortages across the EEA and that difficulties are not as a result of other factors such as salary, employment conditions or lack of upskilling opportunities.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case requesting the additional of an occupation to the highly skilled list would then need to be put forward by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration.  This evidence-based case model was used successfully recently by the agrifood sector in demonstrating the difficulties experienced and the efforts made by that sector in sourcing labour from the EEA.  </p>  <p>  In light of the changing economy and as we continue towards near full employment, it is imperative that the employment permits system is correctly oriented to meet the State&rsquo;s labour market needs.  To that end, I recently published a report reviewing the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system to ensure our policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.  The report confirms that our employment permits system is largely robust with some adjustment required to ensure continued responsiveness, setting out recommendations to be addressed over the short, medium and long term that will ensure that our employment permits system will play its part in supporting Ireland's labour market needs.</p></reply>

The preparation of the prosecution case is a matter for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which is independent in the exercise of its functions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.1123.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600076#WRT06600"><p>The decision by Coca Cola to close Athy International Concentrates was very disappointing for the town of Athy and its wider catchment area. I am informed that the closure is taking place on a phased basis from September 2018 to December 2019. While I very much regret this development, I understand that Coca Cola has committed to supporting staff through redundancy packages, financial advice and re-training. The company has made it clear that it remains fully committed to its other facilities in Ireland.  I understand that more than half the roles that are being lost in Athy will transfer to its facility in Ballina. </p>  <p>  The company indicated to IDA Ireland that they are exploring all options with regard to the building but have not yet confirmed an option. </p>  <p>  On 14th June 2018, I attended a meeting in Athy with local representatives to discuss the closure of the plant. This meeting was a useful opportunity to hear first-hand the impact that this announcement will have on Athy and the surrounding area as well as specific challenges Athy faces. </p>  <p>  At the meeting, I reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to work towards bringing regional unemployment to within one percentage point of the national average by 2020. I am pleased that the Mid-East, as a region, is currently performing very strongly on that measure with an unemployment figure of 5.8% which exceeds that target (CSO Labour Force Survey Q2 2018). </p>  <p>  Regional development is a key priority of the IDA, with a target set of increasing investment in every region of Ireland - by 30%-40% by 2019. Co. Kildare is marketed by IDA Ireland as part of the Mid-East region, together with counties Meath and Wicklow. There are 28 IDA supported client companies in Kildare, collectively employing 9,282 people.  IDA Ireland is working hard to increase these numbers further. A dedicated Regional Business Development Manager for the Mid-East has been appointed to assist the Agency in winning more investment for the area. The Agency will continue to draw the attention of potential investors to the particular strengths of Co. Kildare and the wider Mid-East region.  </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that FDI only forms one part of potential investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth nationally, especially outside Dublin. My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, work together constantly and collaboratively to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across this country.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is working to improve the situation in Athy together with the Local Authority and the Local Enterprise Office (LEO). Following the announcement of the closure of the Coco Cola plant in Athy, LEO Kildare provided support to management and workers.  Currently, 15 of the former employees are undergoing a Start Your Own Business programme, while Kildare County Council, through the LEO office, has also assisted with finding alternative job opportunities for the workers with other companies. In addition, EI is engaging with the Mid-East Regional Skills Forum in relation to the emerging skills agenda, alongside the Forum partners.</p>  <p>  The Mid-East Region Action Plan for Jobs has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Mid-East, through a collaborative approach working with public and private stakeholders. Earlier this year, I asked the Chairs of all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees and other regional stakeholders, to start a process to Refresh and Refocus the Regional Plans, including the Mid-East Plan, to ensure their effectiveness, relevance and impact out to 2020, particularly in light of Brexit and other challenges. </p>  <p>  I met with the Chairs of the Regional Implementation Committees last month to review progress on the refresh of the Plans, including the chairperson of the Mid-East group, Eamonn Sinnott of Intel Ireland. The refreshed Mid-East Regional Action Plan will be an important element in driving new enterprise investment and growth in the three constituent counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, and I look forward to seeing the Plan completed over the coming months. </p>  <p>  In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million in funding to 21 projects to support enterprise capability in the regions under the &euro;60 million competitive EI Regional Enterprise Development Fund.  I expect to announce the results of the second call over the coming weeks, which will allocate the remainder of the &euro;60 million. </p>  <p>  Co. Kildare was the location of one of the 21 successful projects under the first round and secured significant funding to develop a Mid-East Regional Innovation &lsquo;Think-Space&rsquo; to be located in Naas. This facility will be a great support to start-ups and businesses emerging from Co. Kildare and the wider Mid-East. Also under the first round, IT Carlow was successful in securing funding for the Insurtech Network Centre, which again will be an important asset to the Carlow/South Kildare area. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s role is to ensure that the right conditions are in place to allow enterprise to thrive. I was glad to see that everyone around the table that I met in Athy &ndash; TDs, Councillors, the Local Authority, State Agencies, and local businesses &ndash; are committed to a collaborative approach to drive enterprise development in Athy and the wider region.</p></reply>

The audiovisual sector including Film, TV, Animation, and Games contributes to the economy through exports, employment and cultural activity. The audiovisual sector has considerable scope for further growth over the next 5 years and beyond. Ireland has the creative and technical talent and the international credibility to grow and sustain a vibrant creative audiovisual sector. </p>  <p>  The games industry, a key driver of eSports (competitive video gaming) employed 2,040 full time equivalents and generated &euro;3.3m in exports in 2016. A variety of degree, diploma and certificate courses are available for the games sector across the country in institutions such as Ballyfermot College of Further Education, DIT, UL, Dundalk IT, Limerick IT, Tralee IT, Letterkenny IT and Pulse College. These courses include game design, 3D for games, composing for games and online game development. Indigenous developers have established a new representative body called &lsquo;Imirt&rsquo; (www.imirt.ie) and www.developers.ie provides a platform for networking and information sharing.</p>  <p>  The games industry is a small but growing industry and further development would encourage the growth of eSports activities here. I understand that , &lsquo;Three Ireland&rsquo;s EStars&rsquo; which took place in May of this year was the biggest ever eSports tournament held in Ireland demonstrating that there is a growing appetite for eSports in the country. An Audiovisual Sector Brief produced by my Department (to be made available in the coming months) notes that eSports is a growing market globally and is projected to be worth about $1.5 billion by 2020.</p>  <p>  In terms of the supports available through my Department, Enterprise Ireland works with clients in the TV, Film, Animation, Games, AR/VR, Post Production &amp;amp; Visual Effects (VFX). The agency offers a range of supports that are tailored to the needs of the companies in these areas. Individual company financial support has been provided through innovation vouchers, strategic consultancy engagement, key manager employment, technical feasibility projects, market research, management development, business acceleration engagement, innovation vouchers, exhibition at trade fairs, strategic marketing review exercises, market access, eMarketing, R&amp;D, Business Innovation, Expansion, etc.  Based on forging a strong client relationship and with deep sectoral and market knowledge, Enterprise Ireland works in partnership with enterprises to help them start, scale, innovate and win export sales in global markets. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund (&euro;50k equity) has funded over 20 games companies since December 2010.</p>  <p>  EI overseas office executives and teams provide in-market expertise and build networks responding to company needs.  The EI overseas offices support inward buyer visits to Ireland, identifying new opportunities.   Teams in the US, Canada, UK, Europe, the Middle East and Asia provide a range of non-financial expertise to AV sector clients.   Enterprise Ireland regularly hosts market knowledge events for example, &lsquo;Focus on Animation &amp;amp; VFX &ndash; Opportunities in Asia.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland partners with existing and potential clients to help them to establish or expand their operations in Ireland in a range of sectors  including technology, media and content. There are a number of entities within IDA Ireland&rsquo;s client base in the Audiovisual sector.  IDA Ireland is conscious of eSports as a growth area of opportunity.  IDA Ireland continues to monitor this new and evolving segment and will engage with its new and existing clients as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year my Department published our research priority areas for the period 2018 to 2023. ICT research remains a key priority for Irish research and priority areas have been broadened to reflect emerging areas of technology including Digital Platforms, Content and Applications, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. These underpin developments in the audiovisual and gaming industries. This year saw record budget allocation to my department which, amongst other priorities, will further boost innovation. </p>  <p>  I also note that my colleague the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht published The Audiovisual Action Plan in June 2018 which outlines the Government&rsquo;s strategy in relation to AV including the games industry. Recommendations set out in the plan include capital funding for the film sector, tax relief to Ireland&rsquo;s games sector, marketing measures, business skills development and funding for areas like new Irish TV drama. While there are no specific actions in relation to business development of eSports activities, marketing and business development of the broader games industry is addressed including a recommendation to develop &ldquo;Irish Games&rdquo; branding at events which I understand that Screen Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and IDA Ireland are examining. Screen Ireland will review supports to visit markets in consultation with Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with stakeholders to support the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Screen Ireland in the delivery of its Audiovisual Action Plan.</p></reply>

There are now over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin, with 45% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) jobs created last year based in regional locations. The IDA is focused, as am I, on increasing those numbers further. </p>  <p>  FDI trends remain positive in both counties which together have a strong base of well-established companies in the areas of medtech, technology, global business services and life sciences, including firms such as Allergan, Baxter, Merit Medical and Boston Scientific. The IDA is working hard to attract further such investment to Galway and Mayo.</p>  <p>  The Galway-Mayo Relocation Survey, carried out by Collins McNicholas, shows that there is potential to attract new FDI to the area, as well as increase employment in companies already located there. The survey will support the IDA's marketing efforts to win secure investments in the West, where the Agency is already working productively with key stakeholders - including local authorities, the education sector, companies from its own client base and indigenous firms - to create new employment. The IDA also owns sites in both counties that are being actively marketed to its clients.</p></reply>

At my request, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is preparing a report which will make recommendations in relation to the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring an appropriate response to this issue. I am informed that the CMO&rsquo;s Report is close to finalisation with an anticipated publication date in the early weeks of November.</p>  <p>  Pending finalisation of the CMO's report, a number of significant system actions in relation to mesh implants have already been advanced on foot of priority recommendations which were identified in the course of preparation of that report.</p>  <p>  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the Health Service Executive on 20 July 2018 to request that the Executive put immediate measures in place to:</p>  <p>  1. Pause the use of all procedures involving uro-gynaecological/transvaginal mesh implants for the management of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in HSE funded hospitals, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so;</p>  <p>  2. Ensure that in situations where expert clinical judgment is that there is an urgency to carry out the procedure and no  suitable alternative exists, surgery should proceed only if a delay would risk harm to the patient and should be based on  multidisciplinary team decision and fully informed consent.</p>  <p>  This pause is to remain in place pending confirmation of implementation by the Health Service Executive, working in conjunction with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), of three urgent recommendations relating to:</p>  <p>  - Surgical Training;</p>  <p>  - Informed Consent; and</p>  <p>  - the Development of an agreed Dataset of Mesh Procedures.</p>  <p>  The Department also wrote to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Continence Foundation of Ireland requesting that they assist the HSE in progressing these recommendations on an urgent basis.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Executive will be in a position to indicate to the Department that these recommendations have been implemented within a number of months. The HSE has published information concerning the pause on its website for patients affected.</p>  <p>  The provision of appropriate aftercare for women suffering from mesh complications, including appropriate diagnostic facilities, was also identified as a priority recommendation for immediate advancement by the Executive in the course of preparation of the CMO&rsquo;s report.  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the HSE, and to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG), the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), and the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) on May 28 2018, requesting that the Executive commence work on (i) the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials and (ii) clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications, in conjunction with the IOG, the RCSI and the CFI.</p>  <p>  The HSE has informed the Department of Health that a Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. </p>  <p>  This work is ongoing and in relation to the provision of aftercare, will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. It will also include an examination of the role of and requirement for specialist diagnostic services such as translabial scanning. The outcome of this work will clarify if there is a need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any shortfalls identified at national level, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p>  <p>  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website.</p>  <p>  Under the terms and conditions of the health insurance contracts they provide, private health insurers will generally only accept insurance claims where the patient's medical practitioner has deemed the procedure is medically necessary or appropriate. As Minister for Health I do not have a role in directing any health insurer to pay for a procedure without the recommendation of a patient's medical practitioner.</p>  <p>  The HSE advice is that all patients who have experienced complications due to mesh devices are advised to contact their consultant&rsquo;s clinic in the first instance.  Each Hospital Group has nominated an individual to coordinate a response to this group of patients. If patients are having trouble accessing information they can contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at: smi.nwhip@hse.ie for help.</p></reply>

The General Scheme is published on my Department&rsquo;s website. This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. The General Scheme also provides for an independent regulatory authority for AHR.  </p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of this year. The review is on-going and the Committee intends to publish its report early in 2019. The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and officials in my Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the process of drafting this Bill. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

It is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.  Lyme neuroborreliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  </p><p>Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination which may be carried out by a General Practitioner.  Lyme disease may be treated by infectious disease specialists (of which there are 12 nationally) or by general internal medicine available in all acute hospitals.  Medical training programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level in Ireland provides specialist training in infectious diseases, including Lyme disease.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is responsible for the surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases such as Lyme disease. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of the HPSC established a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention with a view to minimising the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. </p><p>The Subcommittee will shortly be meeting to consider its final report to the SAC.  During the report&rsquo;s preparation, the HPSC learned that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK was undertaking a systematic review of Lyme disease which resulted in the NICE Lyme disease guidelines.  These guidelines are based on the most exhaustive systematic review yet undertaken of the evidence around Lyme disease and focused on producing recommendations based on best available evidence relating to diagnosis, management and public awareness of Lyme disease.  </p><p>The HPSC delayed the final production of the Subcommittee report to ensure that the findings of these guidelines could be considered for inclusion into the final report.  The report is in the final stages of preparation and it is planned to circulate the report to members of the Lyme Subcommittee with a view to having a final sign-off meeting of the Subcommittee in November, at which point it will be sent for consideration to the SAC.  At this juncture, it would be inappropriate to consider making changes to the testing, treatment and/or management of the condition until this deliberative process has been completed.  It is envisaged that, once published, these guidelines will provide further assistance to General Practitioners.</p><p>The HPSC also provides extensive information on Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites on its website (www.hpsc.ie).</p></reply>

The Review, which reported earlier this year, examined capacity requirements in key elements of acute care, primary care and services for older people.  </p>  <p>  Increasing capacity alone will not address the challenges faced, but on the basis of significant reform over the next 10-15 years, the report recommends an additional 2,600 acute beds by 2031. The National Development Plan (NDP) provides for a major increase in capacity across the health system including the full complement of additional acute beds by 2028 - 3 years ahead of schedule. </p>  <p>  Arising from the recommendations in the Health Service Capacity Review, my Department engaged with the HSE this year to identify the location and mix of beds which could be opened to alleviate overcrowding in our hospital Emergency Departments for Winter 2018/19. This process culminated in the development by the HSE of a Capacity Plan, which identified over 600 acute beds and 290 residential care beds, to be phased in between 2018 and 2020.</p>  <p>  As a first step towards the implementation of the Capacity Plan, &euro;10 million in funding is being made available in 2019 to enable additional acute beds to be opened for winter 2019/2020.  My Department is currently engaging with the HSE to finalise the details of this investment.</p>  <p>  Under the NDP three new dedicated elective-only hospitals will be introduced which will increase capacity in the hospital system and provide a better separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.</p></reply>

What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  On June 21 2018, the Council of the PSI approved for issuance for public consultation the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018. This public consultation commenced on 17 July and ran until 14 August and afforded any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on the 20 September 2018 where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  </p>  <p>  I understand that since that date the PSI has undertaken to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist.  The redrafted Rules will require approval of the Council of the PSI before a public consultation phase. Subsequent to any public consultation phase the draft Rules must again be approved by the Council before submission for my consent. This Council approval is not anticipated until early in the New Year. </p>  <p>  My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my approval.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.</p><p>Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p><p>From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: <i>hse.ie/yourmedicines</i>.</p><p>The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursement of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician. The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.</p><p>The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and the process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. The General Scheme is published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of this year. The review is on-going and the Committee intends to publish its report early in 2019.</p>  <p>  In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department are working with the HSE to develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p>  <p>  Part of this work includes identifying policy options for a public funding model for AHR treatment. Once I have had the opportunity to consider these policy options I will bring a Memorandum to Government in relation to a model of care for infertility, including public funding for AHR treatment, for the Government's consideration.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill and a model of care for infertility.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. There is also a limited specialist AHR service available through the HSE, which provides funding for fertility preservation for cancer patients whose treatment is likely to impact on their future fertility.</p></reply>

The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 aims to build on the progress already made, with improved cancer prevention, diagnostics, treatment and aftercare support. The Irish Cancer Society made a significant input into the drawing up of the Strategy and plays a very positive role in supporting people affected by cancer.</p>  <p>  Whilst the sentiment behind the Society's campaign in relation to hospital charges is appreciated, making exemptions to these charges on the basis of illness or treatments risks creating inequity within the system.</p>  <p>  The statutory co-payment which is capped at a level that is not large relative to the true cost of providing hospital services, represents an important contribution towards hospitals' operating costs.  While the overall charges are subject to ongoing review their abolition would have significant financial implications.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2019 the Government prioritised the extension of the GP Visit Card income thresholds, reduction in the Drug Payment Scheme monthly threshold and reduction in the prescription charges for those with a medical card over 70 years. The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy commits to consider all existing charges in the context of the annual budgetary process and this will allow for priorities to be determined in reviewing and considering the scope for reduction in charges.</p></reply>

However, the provision of a safe service for all of our patients is also paramount.</p>  <p>  The HSE advise that the elective arthroplasty (joint replacement) service at University Hospital Kerry (UHK) was temporarily suspended in June following a spike in post-operative infections. During this time significant structural and process improvements/upgrades have been made including the physical relocation of the ward.</p>  <p>  Patient pre-assessment restarted two weeks ago and elective arthroplasty surgery recommenced on the morning of the 5 November.</p>  <p>  Prior to the suspension of the service there were 133 patients on the arthroplasty waiting list. No new patients were added to the list during the time of suspension of service, and as a consequence there were still 133 patients on the waiting list when the service was re-opened on the 5th of November. No public or private patients were seen during the time of suspension.</p>  <p>  Management and the orthopaedic surgeons of UHK are confident that delayed patients will be seen quickly now that the service has re-started. UHK advise that with the re-organisation of theatre scheduling there may be additional capacity for elective arthroplasty operations going forward.</p></reply>

The Inpatient and Daycase Action Plan 2018 outlines the combined impact of Health Service Executive (HSE) and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) activity in 2018 to reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment. The plan has already resulted in ongoing improvements with a 16% decrease in the number of patients waiting for procedures since July 2017.</p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan the NTPF has committed to make offers of treatment to patients waiting for one of 50 high-volume procedures including cataracts.  In this context, all patients who are clinically suitable for outsourcing who are waiting more than 9 months for one of these targeted procedures will be offered treatment in 2018.</p>  <p>  In terms of treatment offers, the NTPF authorises public hospitals to offer outsourced treatment to clinically suitable long-waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest-waiting patients first.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to maintaining this positive trend into next year and Budget 2019 announced a total allocation of &euro;75 million for the NTPF.  In 2019, NTPF activity will aim to remove over 100,000 patients from Hospital Waiting Lists through a combination of arranging treatments for patients and through the activity of the Central Waiting List Validation Unit of the NTPF.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, there have been calls to extend the Nursing Home Support Scheme, commonly known as the 'Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme, to cover home support services.  In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s pledge in <i>A Programme for a Partnership Government</i>to introduce &lsquo;a uniform homecare service so all recipients can receive a quality support, 7 days per week, where possible&rsquo;, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy instead commits to the establishment of a stand-alone statutory scheme for homecare in 2021.</p><p>The new scheme will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service allocation.  It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner as well as helping to improve access to home support services on an affordable and sustainable basis. The introduction of a system of regulation for home support will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided by ensuring good standards are maintained on an ongoing basis.  The new scheme will also be designed to support family/unpaid carers and will integrate effectively with other health and social care services, such as long-term residential care (including the Nursing Homes Support Scheme), primary and community services, and hospital services.</p><p>The development of a statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services is a complex undertaking.  Important milestones in the process of developing the new scheme include the publication of a review of the home care systems in 4 EU countries in April 2017 and a report of the findings of a public consultation on home care in June 2018.  Over 2,600 responses to the consultation were received.  This initial research and stakeholder consultation has significantly enhanced the evidence base for the development of the proposed statutory scheme.</p><p>However, a significant amount of additional work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of the home support scheme and system of regulation. This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. The Department will continue to prioritise its work in developing the new scheme and every effort will be made to progress this matter as quickly as possible.</p><p>While the new home support scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive are continuing efforts to improve existing home support services. In 2018 the HSE brought the funding for home help and Home Care Packages together into a single home support service for older people. As well as simplifying the application process for home support, the new service will be more responsive to service users' changing needs.  More broadly the HSE will continue to encourage local integration of services and to build appropriate care pathways, in particular for people with complex needs. A consumer-directed approach to home support provision will be introduced, giving service users greater choice in relation to when they receive services and their selection of a service provider. This enhancement of current service provision is being supported by increased investment in home support services. In line with the commitment in <i>A Programme for a Partnership Government</i>(2016) to increase funding for home care annually, home support services received particular priority in Budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25m allocated bringing the total home support allocation for 2018 to almost &euro;417 million, which includes funding for intensive home care packages. The HSE 2018 National Service Plan provides for over 17 million home support hours to be delivered to 50,500 people at any time and 235 Intensive Home Care Packages for people with more complex needs delivering approximately 360,000 hours in the full year. A further 156,000 hours, relating to adverse weather funding, will be provided this year.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE are currently in the process of developing and agreeing the HSE's National Service Plan 2019, which will set out in detail the type and quantum of services to be delivered in 2019 including in relation to home support services.</p></reply>

Results from the pilots did indicate that additional resources, both nursing and healthcare assistants, were required in those pilot sites.

As PHCPs are a clinical rather than respite support, nurses delivering care do not assume sole responsibility for a child in the home.  It is also the case that the loco parentis provision is necessary in case of an acute emergency such as respiratory arrest, de-cannulation of a tracheostomy or status epilepticus.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I am very aware of the issues raised regarding the operation of the loco parentis rule and have asked my officials to engage with the HSE to ensure that concerns around the operation of this provision and its potential impact on parents are considered as part of the Quality Assurance Process for PHCPs. </p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE has developed an extensive suite of new policy and practice documents which will provide a framework for the care of children with complex needs in the community.  In developing this new approach, the HSE has listened to parents, taken advice from Royal College of Nursing in Britain and consulted with specialists in Ireland.  I am informed that the HSE hopes to be able to publish the suite of documentation before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Whilst individuals have a right to membership of any trade union, if they choose to join an association which is not recognised by their employer, such membership is not facilitated by their employer.  This means that the HSE does not facilitate deduction of union subscriptions for this particular Association.

The General Scheme is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of this year. The review is on-going and the Committee intends to publish its report early in 2019. </p><p>The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and the process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The specific provisions relating to surrogacy are outlined in Part 6 of the General Scheme.  These provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority. The Scheme also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). </p><p>Under the AHR Bill AHR services will be made available to people irrespective of gender, marital status or sexual orientation on the basis of equality and non-discrimination. The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the Scheme.</p><p>The Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018 was enacted on 24 July 2018.  This Act was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act. Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act deal with the regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures carried out in the State, and with the rights of children born as a result of those procedures.  Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act will also provide for the granting of a retrospective declaration of parentage in relation to a child born as a result of a DAHR procedure prior to the commencement of Parts 2&amp;amp; 3, subject to certain conditions.</p><p>A number of issues relating to areas that fall outside of provisions of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 were raised during the debate on the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Act 2018. Officials from my Department are engaging with their colleagues in the Departments of Justice and Equality, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and Children and Youth Affairs, in relation to these issues and it is my intention to give a substantial update on these issues once this process of engagement has been concluded.</p></reply>

One of those recommendations is to examine the evidence regarding the outcomes of the use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy ('NRT') and other approaches.  </p><p>My Department requested HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment ('HTA') of the clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical smoking cessation products and services. The HTA was published in 2017 and found that all the pharmacological interventions were effective compared to no treatment and that a prescription only drug called varenicline was the most effective drug on its own. However, the HTA also found that using a combination of varenicline and NRT was the most effective pharmacological intervention and that people using this combination were over three and a half times more likely to quit than those who were in a control group and did not receive this treatment. </p><p>Group behavioural therapy, individual counselling, intensive advice and telephone support were all found to be effective behavioural interventions with group therapy found to be the most effective of these interventions. The addition of a behavioural intervention to a pharmacological intervention improved the effectiveness of the intervention.</p><p>The HTA recommended that smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of varenicline, either alone or in combination with NRT, for smokers who want to use a pharmacological support. </p><p>In relation to e-cigarettes and vaping, although the HTA found that results for e-cigarettes are promising, there is currently a lack of evidence to recommend their use as a smoking cessation aid and at present no e-cigarette product is licensed as a medicinal product in Ireland. The safety of e-cigarettes is an evolving area of research; while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on its long-term safety has yet to be established. In the absence of additional evidence confirming the effectiveness of e-cigarettes, the HTA recommended that the HSE smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of combination NRT treatment among those for whom varenicline is contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred.  </p><p>The results of the HTA are informing the development by the HSE, in conjunction with the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, of national clinical guidelines.</p><p>The Department of Health is aware of, and actively monitoring, publications by authoritative bodies internationally on the use of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool. Analysis of emerging research on all products, and the findings of Healthy Ireland 2018 in relation to e-cigarette usage in Ireland, will continue to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.1537.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600082#WRZ06800"><p>In any given year, the Government has a finite amount of money for allocation in the Budget, and has many competing priorities. </p><p>During the fiscal crisis, as with most areas of public spending, significant reductions in health funding were experienced. Including 2014, the budget provided for Health was less than that provided in the previous year, with significant targeted savings through pay reductions and efficiency.</p><p>2015 saw the first modest increase in the health vote for a number of years, and whilst welcome, proved insufficient, given the erosion of the base funding during the financial emergency.  The supplementary estimate that year was required to meet ongoing running costs in the sector, new initiatives commenced during the year and some demand led services, and was provided on a once off basis. Thus, whilst 2016 saw a further budgetary increase, the majority of the funding merely met the existing costs within the system, along with pay rate increases. In recognition of the difficulties facing the system, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform approved a further &euro;500m for health in the REV, this sum remaining in the base for 2017. This allowed for services for older people to be maintained at the previous year's levels (&euro;30m), met shortfalls in the State Claims Agency (SCA) and PCRS (&euro;200m) and provided for a Winter Initiative at &euro;40m. </p><p>Additional funding of &euro;450m was provided in the 2017 budget, along with a further supplementary estimate of &euro;195m. Of the original funding, 39% was required for pay rate and pension costs with a further 6% supporting the SCA. In relation to the supplementary estimate that year, a 38% or &euro;75m related to the acceleration of the restoration of pay under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, with a further 25% or &euro;50m required for the SCA.  </p><p>For 2018, 45% of the additional funding provided in the budget was required for pay restoration, resulting in very modest increase for services, and the consequent need for a further supplementary estimate. When account is taken of pay restoration, costs associated with the SCA and other demand led areas, there is a reason for the level of increased expenditure year on year. Further, the nature of the health services is such that the normal budget management levers available to other sectors, such as reduction of services, are simply not available to us and consequently, overruns can and do occur.  External factors, such as the actions of the Private Health Insurers, can also drive the need for additional funding. </p><p>During the period 2014 to 2018 the reasons for the receipt of supplementary funding are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>Government/DoH Policy Implementation </th><th>Demographics, Complexity, Capacity </th><th>Demand-Led </th><th>Other </th></tr><tr><td>Emergency Department Taskforce Action Plan </td><td>Acute Hospitals </td><td>State Claims Agency </td><td>Private insurer campaign </td></tr><tr><td>Waiting List Initiative </td><td>Disabilities - Emergency Placements and Regulation </td><td>Local Demand Led Schemes </td><td>Appropriation in Aid shortfalls </td></tr><tr><td>Winter Initiative </td><td>Home Supports </td><td>Pensions </td><td>First charge </td></tr><tr><td>Accelerated Pay Awards </td><td></td><td>Overseas Treatment </td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>Under the NHSS Act 2009 the HSE may, in respect of a person who is being provided with care services, whether of its own initiative or at the request of the person, at any time arrange for a review to be carried out of all or any of the following as appropriate:</p><p>- the care needs assessment;</p><p>- the financial assessment relating to the person; or</p><p>- the weekly amount of payments made by way of ancillary State support in respect of that person.</p><p>A participant in the Scheme can request the HSE to review their financial assessment on the condition that 12 months have passed since the initial assessment or the most recent review. Participants in the scheme are also obligated to inform the HSE of any material change in circumstances, including an increase in income or means.</p><p>It should be noted that any increase in income or means not notified to the HSE will result in recoupment by the HSE of the support that was advanced over and above what was due to the participant.</p><p>I would encourage any participant in the Scheme to contact their local area HSE office with any queries relating to their financial contribution towards their cost of care.</p></reply>

As you are aware, there have been calls to extend the Nursing Home Support Scheme, commonly known as the 'Fair Deal&rsquo; scheme to cover home support services. In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s pledge in <i>A Programme for a Partnership Government</i>to introduce &lsquo;a uniform homecare service so all recipients can receive a quality support, 7 days per week, where possible&rsquo;, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy instead commits to the establishment of a standalone statutory scheme for homecare in 2021.</p><p>The new scheme will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to service allocation. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner as well as helping to improve access to home support services on an affordable and sustainable basis. The introduction of a system of regulation for home support will help to ensure public confidence in the services provided by ensuring good standards are maintained on an ongoing basis. The new scheme will also be designed to support family/unpaid carers and will integrate effectively with other health and social care services, such as long term residential care (including the Nursing Homes Support Scheme), primary and community services, and hospital services. </p><p>The development of a statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services is a complex undertaking. Important milestones in the process of developing the new scheme include the publication of a review of the home care systems in 4 EU countries in April 2017 and a report of the findings of a public consultation on home care in June 2018.  Over 2,600 responses to the consultation were received. This initial research and stakeholder-consultation has significantly enhanced the evidence-base for the development of the proposed statutory scheme.</p><p>However, a significant amount of additional work remains to be carried out before final decisions are taken on the form of the home support scheme and system of regulation. This is required if the reforms are to be successful, affordable and sustainable. The Department will continue to prioritise its work in developing the new scheme and every effort will be made to progress this matter as quickly as possible. </p><p>While the new home support scheme is under development, the Department of Health and Health Service Executive are continuing efforts to improve existing home support services. In 2018 the HSE brought the funding for home help and Home Care Packages together into a single home support service for older people. As well as simplifying the application-process for home support, the new service will be more responsive to service-users' changing needs. More broadly the HSE will continue to encourage local integration of services and to build appropriate care-pathways, in particular for people with complex needs. A consumer-directed approach to home support provision will be introduced, giving service users greater choice in relation to when they receive services and their selection of a service provider. This enhancement of current service provision is being supported by increased investment in home support services. In line with the commitment in <i>A Programme for a Partnership Government</i>(2016) to increase funding for home-care annually, home support services received particular priority in Budget 2018, with an additional &euro;18.25m allocated bringing the total home support allocation for 2018 to almost &euro;417 million which includes funding for intensive home care packages. The HSE 2018 National Service Plan provides for over 17 million home support hours to be delivered to 50,500 people at any time and 235 Intensive Home Care Packages for people with more complex needs delivering approximately 360,000 hours in the full year. A further 156,000 hours, relating to adverse weather funding, will be provided this year.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE are currently in the process of developing and agreeing the HSE's National Service Plan 2019 which will set out in detail the type and quantum of services to be delivered in 2019 including in relation to home support services.  </p><p>In relation to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, as this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These standards promote person-centred care, uphold the rights of people, respect privacy and dignity and protect people living in residential care from abuse and neglect. They provide the framework for HIQA to assess whether residential centres are providing high-quality, safe and effective services and can be registered as &lsquo;designated centres', in line with the requirements of the Health Act 2007. </p>  <p>  The regulatory requirements are prescriptive and there are a number of relevant statutory provisions in place in relation to visiting arrangements in various residential care settings. In relation to older people&rsquo;s settings for example, under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 415 of 2013), the registered provider shall make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors and the person in charge shall ensure that, in so far as is reasonably practicable, visits to a resident are not restricted, unless such a visit would, in the opinion of the person in charge, pose a risk to the resident concerned or to another resident, or the resident concerned has requested the restriction of visits. </p>  <p>  In relation to approved mental health centres, the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centre) Regulations 2006 include a requirement that approved centres take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of residents and visitors and have written operational policies and procedures in relation to visits and the health and safety of residents, staff and visitors.</p>  <p>  From a policy perspective, I have taken a number of steps to ensure the voice of patients is embedded in the health service. I intend to appoint two patient advocates to the board of the Health Service Executive. Proposals for an independent Patient Safety Council are at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government very shortly.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy is raising this important issue in the context of a recent Prime Time programme which was broadcast on 25 October. The Health Service Executive has advised that each of the current instances where some level of a restriction is in place will be reviewed. I welcome that decision.</p>  <p>  The aspects of the question which relate primarily to service matters and related operational protocols and appeals processes have been referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

In 2011 and 2012, the HPRA reduced fees, and there were no fee increases between 2013 and 2017. Fees were increased by approximately 2% in 2018. </p>  <p>  The impact of new EU legislation continues to be felt across the organisation. For example, the Falsified Medicines Directive will commence in 2019, and the Clinical Trials Regulation is scheduled to be implemented in 2020. The regulatory model for medicines is becoming more complex, and EU pharmacovigilance legislation has led to an increase in the number of referrals and regulatory actions arising from the outcome of these referrals. Public scrutiny and the role of the regulator in relation to medicines such as the HPV vaccine has increased, while compliance activity is also increasing.</p>  <p>  Over the last several years, the HPRA has continued to enhance services to support the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland. The development of an innovation office and an international platform has brought greater oversight and global co-operation to the benefit of all stakeholders and of public health. The development of the agency has ensured that the HPRA is well placed to negotiate the impact of Brexit and continual changes in the regulatory environment.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive has advised that each of the current instances where some level of a restriction is in place will be reviewed. I welcome that decision.</p><p>I can assure you that my Department will be in direct contact with the individual concerned in response to her correspondence, which raises a number of issues.</p><p>From a policy perspective, I have taken a number of steps to ensure the voice of patients is embedded in the health service. I intend to appoint two patient advocates to the board of the Health Service Executive. Proposals for an independent Patient Safety Council are at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government very shortly.</p><p>In December 2017, the Government approved the development of a national adult safeguarding policy for the health sector. The policy, when developed, will cover the public, voluntary and private health sector and will include proposals on collaboration, information-sharing and referral arrangements between the health sector and other key sectors, and will include appropriate underpinning legislation.</p><p>My Department submitted a detailed proposal to the Law Reform Commission requesting the inclusion of an examination of the law on adult safeguarding in its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.</p><p>Relevant stakeholders were recently invited to submit views on the themes to be covered when developing the health sector policy, to assist my Department in structuring the detailed policy drafting phase which will shortly commence, and will involve ongoing stakeholder consultation. My officials are in the process of putting these structures in place, with a view to:</p><p>- commencing the detailed policy drafting process phase in December;</p><p>- circulating a draft policy for public consultation by the second half of 2019; </p><p>- securing Government approval to detailed and costed policy proposals around the end of 2019; and </p><p>- introducing draft legislation to underpin the approved policy thereafter.</p><p>Two further major policy initiatives in relation to adult safeguarding in the health sector are under way.  The completion by the HSE of a major review and revision of its national operational adult safeguarding policy is at an advanced stage and will be very important in informing my Department&rsquo;s development of the national health sector policy and identifying possible policy or legislative gaps. </p><p>Joint national standards on adult safeguarding for relevant health and social care centres, which are being developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Mental Health Commission, are also at an advanced stage.</p></reply>

Under GDPR, transparency is now a core principle and health services providers should ensure that they have arrangements in place to meet that principle so that patients are aware of who may have access to their information and why, especially any third party access. That includes for billing purposes.  My Department is currently finalising Regulations under section 36 of the Data Protection Act aimed at introducing further suitable and specific safeguards for the processing of personal data by health services providers. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working on a new patient centred Health Information Policy and I plan to publish the results of the public consultation on the policy framework in the next couple of months.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on medicine reimbursement. As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a product to be reimbursed in the community drug schemes, it must apply to the HSE to have the product added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments may be multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  The NCPE completed an HTA on 29 August 2018 for ocrelizumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. It recommended that ocrelizumab not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. </p>  <p>  On 4 October 2018, the NCPE completed its assessment of ocrelizumab for the treatment of early primary progressive multiple sclerosis. It did not recommend reimbursement for this indication.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it is in discussion with the applicant in relation to the reimbursement of ocrelizumab. Any decision it makes on reimbursement will be taken in the context of expert advice received and the statutory criteria set out in the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p>  <p>  If the patient in question has applied for, but not yet been approved, for a medical card, then he/she would not be entitled to receive services under the medical card scheme until such time as the application has been processed and approved by the HSE.</p></reply>

The Health Act allows me to extend the period provided to the HSE to prepare, adopt and submit its Service Plan, if required.

Once the Service Plan is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas the HSE will ensure it is published at the earliest possible time.</p></reply>

This may be to cope with increased unanticipated surges in demand on services or unplanned staff absences due to illness.</p>  <p>  The HSE are continually working to reduce the level of agency but I acknowledge that more could be done in that regard.  Recruitment and retention measures implemented by the HSE include offering student nurses and midwives permanent contracts as they graduate. The Bring Them Home initiative means that a nurse returning from abroad could receive up to &euro;3,000 if they remain for a year.  Educational opportunities and career path for existing staff have also improved.  Ideally, I would like to see agency nurses choosing to become permanent members of staff. However, quite often when HSE management have approached agency nursing staff, the offer is declined.  It may be that agency nurses prefer the flexibility of agency work and not being tied to one single employer.  </p>  <p>  I must take this opportunity to strongly refute this claim of a 20% 'pay gap' between agency nurses and their HSE nursing colleagues.  I understand that the HSE completed a tender process for the supply of agency nurses and there are a number of qualified companies in place which supply nurses to the HSE.  The rate of pay paid to a nurse through these qualified companies is the same as the directly employed HSE staff.  Any additional cost is attributed to the fee paid to the employment agency and VAT. I understand, however, that in the unlikely event of these qualified companies being unable to provide a nurse, employment agencies who are outside of this contract can be engaged and increased costs on pay can accrue. However, this is in exceptional circumstances only and to describe this as a 20% pay gap is very misleading.  </p></reply>

The Agreement itself does not specify fees or mark-ups, other than &ldquo;in accordance with such rates as may be approved or directed by the Minister from time to time after consultation with the Pharmaceutical Contractors Committee [of the IPU]&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Section 9 of the 2009 Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, as amended by the 2015 Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, provides that, despite existing enactments or contractual or other arrangements, the Minister for Health may, by regulation made with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, vary payments to health professionals for services provided to or on behalf of a health body. </p>  <p>  Section 9(13) of the 2009 Act requires me, as Minister for Health, to carry out an annual review of the amounts and rates set by regulation for contracted health professionals. As Minister, I must consider the appropriateness of the amounts and rates, in line with criteria set out in section 9. </p>  <p>  The most recent review, carried out in June 2018, noted a 14% increase in the number of pharmacy contracts between 2008 and 2017 and a 13% increase in the number of items dispensed through the community drug schemes in the same period. I concluded that the current rates for pharmacy services are appropriate. </p>  <p>  I consider that changes in contractor payments should be linked to Government priorities for the health service and service expansion or contractual developments and based on available resources.</p></reply>

The functions of the PSI are carried out on its behalf by the Council of the Society.  </p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides for an exception to the general provision in the Act which requires the sale and supply of medicines at a pharmacy to be conducted under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, and specifies that no offence is committed where a registered pharmaceutical assistant &ldquo;acts on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Section 30 also permits the Council to make rules as to:</p>  <p>  1. What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and</p>  <p>  2. What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  On June 21 2018, the Council of the PSI approved for issuance for public consultation the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018. This public consultation commenced on 17 July and ran until 14 August and afforded any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on the 20th September 2018 where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  </p>  <p>  I understand that since that date the PSI has undertaken to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist.  The redrafted Rules will require approval of the Council of the PSI before a public consultation phase. Subsequent to any public consultation phase the draft Rules must again be approved by the Council before submission for my consent.  This Council approval is not anticipated until early in the New Year. </p>  <p>  My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my approval.  I must consider any Rules presented to me from a fair and impartial perspective, without prejudice or prejudgement. </p>  <p>  I await the receipt of the Rules for my consideration from the PSI and, until that time, I am unfortunately not in a position to comment any further on the matter raised.</p></reply>

The sea lice management and control protocols and in particular the Pest Management Strategy introduced in 2008 lay down conditions for the compulsory control of sea lice infestation levels on marine salmon farms. </p><p>These protocols are more advanced than those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p><p>- The inspection regime is totally independent of the industry.</p><p>- Data obtained as a result of inspection is published and made widely available.</p><p>- Treatment trigger levels are set at a low level.</p><p>The sea lice monitoring and control programme in Ireland has been acknowledged by the Environment Directorate (DG Environment) of the EU Commission as representing international best practice.</p><p>The salmon louse, <i>Lepeoptheirus salmonis</i>, is a small crustacean ecto-parasite of salmon.  It is found on the skin and fins of the fish and is clearly visible to the naked eye with adult females being approximately the size of a thumbnail. </p><p>In relation to cleaner fish, I can confirm that, several species of this fish are used in Ireland as a method of controlling sea lice.  The cleaner fish, which include several species of wrasse, supplement their diet by removing and eating the lice.  This biological method of control is very effective and can reduce the reliance on medicines to control sea lice.</p></reply>

This proposal has the main objective of the prevention and reduction of plastic marine litter from single use plastic items and fishing gear containing plastic by complementing the measures already envisaged under the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy adopted in January 2018. </p>  <p>  This proposal for a Directive, if adopted, would provide for measures for the improved management of waste fishing gear containing plastic returned to shore and its financing.  These mechanisms and incentives are expected to increase the share of recovered fishing gear at the end of their life.  In this context, I understand that BIM are working with fishermen and net manufacturers in the main fishing ports to put in place a better system to track fishing gear from purchase to end of life.  By Improving accountability will help to reduce the amount of waste fishing gear being dumped at sea.</p>  <p>  I understand that it is expected that the Council and the European Parliament will enter into negotiations under the EU co-decision process to agree the details provisions of the Directive .</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am advised by BIM that the use of biodegradable fishing gear is quite limited at present.  I understand that there have been numerous experimental trials of biodegradable nets but all have found catch rates are greatly reduced while the costs of production are very high compared to traditional monofilament and nylon nets.  I am informed that there are examples, including from Ireland, of fishermen fitting biodegradable escape panels to lobster and crab pots which, when the pot is lost, degrade over time, letting any catch inside the pot escape.</p></reply>

This strategy outlined certain initiatives that would bring about improvements in the sector.</p>  <p>   My Department is fully committed to maximising the potential of the Sport Horse industry and continues to provide support to it both financially and with policy initiatives. I have demonstrated my commitment to the industry by increasing the budget allocated to Horse Sport Ireland from &euro;2.0m in 2017 to &euro;2.5m in 2018 and I have approved a further increase of &euro;500,000 to &euro;3.0m in 2019.  This is an increase of 50% on the 2017 allocation.   </p>  <p>   In 2016 my Department commissioned Indecon International Consultants to undertake a review of Horse Sport Ireland.  Indecon found that additional resources will be needed to support the expansion of the sector and reports like the strategy report from The Sport Horse Alliance make this point clearly.</p>  <p>  Horse Sport Ireland have been making huge strides in implementing the Indecon recommendations.  The proposals to rationalise the board is close to finality with only the Northern representative outstanding.  A recruitment process through the Public Appointments Service was undertaken to select a new chairperson and three board members.  These members are now in place alongside the 4 industry representatives.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to the sport horse industry and I am confident that this additional Government support will help the sector increase its economic and social contribution into the future.</p></reply>

Coillte further advise that all Coillte operatives are trained on environmental aspects of chemical application such as protection of watercourses and other important natural features.  Coillte adds that it erects notice signs in its forests to inform the public where chemicals have been applied.  </p>  <p>  The company also advises that Coillte&rsquo;s environmental management systems are certified externally to ISO standards on health and safety and the environment (ISO 14001 &amp;amp; OHSAS 18001) and Coillte&rsquo;s overall forest management is dual certified as fully sustainable by both the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for Endorsing Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC).  </p>  <p>  Coillte advises that it uses two plant protection products in forestry, a herbicide, glyphosate, and an insecticide, cypermethrin and that it only uses plant protection products that are statutorily approved as safe to use in forestry.  Coillte add that it continually monitors and updates all research in regard to this to ensure that its forests are maintained to the highest standard and with regard to the best silvicultural expertise available.</p>  <p>  Glyphosate and cypermethrin have been approved for use in forestry nationally by the Pesticide Registration and Control Division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and further approved for use in the European Union by the European Commission.  </p>  <p>  Coillte advises that it records all of its use of plant protection products on its lands and that the company&rsquo;s procedures are checked and audited regularly both internally and externally.</p></reply>

The programme identifies a number of methods for supporting the sector, such as ensuring smaller inshore boats are given new opportunities for commercial fishing.  Support is being provided under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme (EMFF OP) for enhanced management and conservation of inshore stocks, including v-notching of lobster, more selective fishing gear and preparation and implementation of management plans for a sustainable inshore fishery.  Funding of some &euro;6 million has been earmarked under the programme for the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.</p><p>I meet regularly with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF).  The NIFF and its supporting network of six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) cover the entire coast.  The Inshore Forums provide a platform for the discussion of problems facing the inshore sea-fisheries sector and have been making recommendation to me on issues of concern for their sector.</p><p>The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for the inshore sector, including developing for the first time a dedicated strategy.  From my meetings with the NIFF, I have introduced a number of industry-led initiatives, developed through the forum structures, following extensive consultation.  These include conservation measures for inshore stocks such as velvet crab and scallop off the coast of Wexford.  Public consultations were also held earlier this year (2018) on proposed management measures recommended to me by the NIFF in respect of brown crab and razor clam in the North Irish Sea. </p><p>I also recently undertook a public consultation process to examine the arrangements for trawling inside the six nautical mile zone and inside the baselines.  This consultation ended on 11 June 2018.</p><p>Over 1,000 responses were received in relation to the public consultation and these are currently being examined.  Taking into account the submissions received and following any necessary further analysis I will carefully consider any possible measures to be introduced.  My decision will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website as early as possible.</p></reply>

This is necessary in order to protect forests and also to ensure that forestry operations and activities are carried out in compliance with the principles of sustainable forest management.  The obligation to replant felled trees is required under the Forestry Act, 2014 and the Forestry Regulations, SI 191/2017.</p>  <p>Due to the extent of deforestation by the early 20th Century, legislation was introduced to regulate tree felling.  This has facilitated, in part, sustainable forest management.  There is a need to avoid deforestation in relation to economic and social considerations and particularly in an environmental context such as carbon, landscape and amenity considerations.  Reforestation after felling is essential to prevent deforestation, which would otherwise counteract the benefits of the initial afforestation.</p>  <p>  While my Department funds initial afforestation through a grant and the payment of premia, all replanting is to be carried out at the land owner&rsquo;s expense regardless of whether the site was initially grant-aided or not.  In the majority of cases, landowners fund the replanting of their lands from the proceeds of the sale of the extracted timber.  The proceeds are tax free which gives an additional boost to the clearfell income of the landowner. </p>  <p>  I understand a tree felling licence, for the person named, issued in July this year, providing for the felling of over 18 ha of Sitka spruce and to thin a small area of Ash.  The issued licence also included details of the replanting operations.  As is normal for such cases, an inspection of the licensed works and replanting will be arranged at a later date to check that the person named has fully complied with the conditions of the licence.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department also has responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of North Harbour at Cape Clear, as well as the maintenance of a small number of specific piers, lights and beacons throughout Ireland, in accordance with the 1902 ex-congested Districts Board piers, lights and Beacons Act, the aids to navigation located at Derrynane Harbour fall within the remit of my Department as a consequence.</p>  <p>  I would advise the Deputy that the leading lights at Derrynane Harbour are operational and were upgraded in 2013. The two beacons referred to provide safe navigation to mariners on approach into Derrynane Harbour and have traditionally never been fitted with lights. These beacons are currently showing signs of structural deterioration and require repair and upgrade works.</p>  <p>  To that end, my Department has engaged the services of Consulting Engineers to prepare detailed design for repair and upgrade works. A design has been completed and is currently under review by the Department&rsquo;s Marine Engineering Division. It should be noted that as part of the design process, detailed consultation has taken place with local users and locals concerned in regard to the heritage value of the existing beacons in order to take their concerns on board.</p>  <p>  While no final decisions on the details of the 2019 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme have been made at this stage, I have increased the overall allocation to this Programme by &euro;6.29m to &euro;27.29m, and expect the necessary repair and upgrading works on these beacons at Derrynane Harbour, including the provision of new lighting, to be carried out in 2019.</p></reply>

My officials regularly access these records to service queries from the public relating to current and past transactions and for the full completion of the work of the former ILC.  Owners and purchasers of land and their personal or legal representatives are allowed access to and copies of relevant documents/maps. Since 2008, over 14,300 search and retrieval cases have been completed by the seven full time staff currently based at the Records Storage facility in Portlaoise.  There are no statistics available relating to whether the requests were granted in part or in full.  The office does not provide a research facility, as the provision of such a service would require much greater resources than those currently available.    </p>  <p>  My Department is mindful of the public interest in obtaining access to the vast repository of former ILC documents held.  However wider access will be a matter for consideration when the completion of the work of the former ILC is at a more advanced stage.    Furthermore the records which are available in paper format only are fragile, some dating back as far as the early 1800's and are an irreplaceable resource should they get damaged.  In order to maintain them, it is essential that they are handled and stored appropriately.  Opening up access to these files cannot be considered until appropriate measures are undertaken to minimise potential damage from routine handling.  </p>  <p>  In these circumstances, discussions with other Departments or State Bodies on general public availability of the documents have not arisen.  However, the Department is in discussions with Trinity College Dublin with a view to cooperating in its research project &ldquo;Beyond 2022&rdquo;.  The project seeks to create a virtual archive, recreating records that were destroyed in the fire in the Public Record Office of Ireland at the Four Courts in 1922.   Relevant records have been identified in the ILC.</p>  <p>  Under the Freedom of Information Acts, any individual is entitled to view personal data, or third party data held by this Department, subject to the restrictions laid out in those Acts.  </p></reply>

Current prices stand at &euro;139.93/100kg, which is 9% below prices at the same time in 2017 (an exceptional year for pig prices).</p>  <p>  The continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit lends an even greater urgency to the expansion of international market access. And as such, my Department and I have made a major push to encourage market diversification. In June of 2017 I visited Mexico, the fourth largest importer of chilled and frozen pork in the world and made access to that market a top priority. Following visits from Mexican authorities, six export plants will shortly be audited as part of the first stage of gaining access to the Mexican market for Irish pig meat exporters.</p>  <p>  There has also been a significant expansion in Ireland&rsquo;s pig meat exports to East Asia in general and to China in particular. China is now the largest third country market with exports of &euro;102m last year. In May I lead a trade mission to China, visiting Beijing and Shanghai.  This visit included events, in association with Bord Bia, to promote Irish pork to further develop export opportunities.</p>  <p>  I also travelled to Japan and the Republic of Korea in autumn 2017 to promote further opportunities for Irish producers in these markets. Exports to Japan more than doubled to &euro;22m in 2017, putting it in second place in international markets. We can also expect that the new free trade agreement with Japan (JEEPA) will provide further benefit to trade. Growth in the Philippines was also strong, up 54%, making it the third-largest international market for Irish pigmeat exports. Additionally, I recently lead the first ever Irish governmental trade mission to Malaysia, where I agreed a veterinary health certificate for pigmeat, an important milestone in the process of opening this market for Irish exporters. </p>  <p>  Last year the total value of pig meat exports, taking account of all pigmeat including prepared and preserved, was more than &euro;793 million; an increase from &euro;733 million in 2016. In volume terms, exports rose by over 10 million tonnes, growing from 265.3 million tonnes in 2016 to 277.1 million tonnes in 2017. I will continue to work closely with the sector and, by focusing on insight-led growth strategies, capitalise upon opportunities for Irish pig meat exporters on international markets.  </p>  <p>  As regards  support for primary producers, TAMS II measures (under the 2014-2020 RDP plan) provide grants for capital investment in physical assets to assist the agriculture sector, including the pig sector, to develop their businesses. There are a huge variety of items available under the suite of TAMS measures and the Pig Sector is catered for under the current Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme (PPIS) of TAMS II. Additionally, in 2016 I established a Pig Implementation Strategy Group which oversees implementation of the measures recommended in the report of the Pig Industry Stakeholder Group. This group has an important role to play in achieving the objectives for the industry as laid out in Food Wise 2025. </p></reply>

To this end I introduced a number of targeted measures including:</p>  <p>  - a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive engagement with this measure</p>  <p>  - a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. The measure operates through the Co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12th August 2018 to 31st December 2018.</p>  <p>  In July I secured agreement from EU Commissioner Hogan to pay higher advance Pillar 1 and 2 payments which will be increased to 70% and 85% respectively. Almost &euro;1 billion has been paid to farmers under Pillar 1 and 2 since mid September. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, my Department made some temporary adjustments to the GLAS scheme for this year which have the potential to add to the quantities of winter fodder available by bringing over 260,000 additional hectares into production. In addition, in consultation with my ministerial colleague Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., a two week extension of the closed period for the spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers was implemented that allowed farmers capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production. </p>  <p>  Surveys of fodder supplies conducted on my behalf by Teagasc have shown a significant improvement in fodder availability with the national deficit moving from an estimated 18% shortage in early July to an 11% shortage in mid-September. Whilst there still remains a significant deficit on some farms I am hopeful that the results of a survey currently being finalised by Teagasc will show a further reduction in the national deficit given the favourable growing conditions of recent weeks.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that the range of measures introduced by me to date, taken together and targeted at producing as much fodder as possible from our own land, is the most effective response to ensuring adequate supplies ahead of the coming Winter.  Notwithstanding all of the above mentioned actions,  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to closely monitor and engage on this significant challenge during the coming period.</p></reply>

The NECP will include trajectories for renewable energy (including renewable electricity ambitions), energy efficiency, and national emissions, as well as the measures required to achieve these trajectories.    The Plan will contain the policies and measures proposed to reach our 2030 energy and climate goals. The first draft is due for submission to the European Commission by 31 December 2018, with the final version due by 31 December 2019. Energy and Climate Change modelling work to look at energy and climate policy options out to 2030 will underpin the development of the draft NECP, in particular on identifying cost effective, yet realistic solutions that will contribute to realising our national greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency ambitions.</p>  <p>  The high level design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) was approved by Government in July 2018 and it is expected that the first renewable electricity auctions will take place under RESS in 2019. The RESS has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework. The scheme will provide for a renewable electricity (RES-E) ambition of up to a maximum of 55% by 2030 subject to determining the cost effective level which will be set out in the NECP.</p>  <p>  Technology diversity, including solar PV and offshore wind, will occur naturally as the scheme matures and certain intervention levers may be used within each auction round to promote certain policy objectives such as community participation, community ownership and diversifying the renewable energy mix.</p>  <p>  In developing and expanding renewable energy support schemes, a careful balance must be struck between the subsidy to renewable generators and the additional costs to pay for these schemes that are transferred to electricity bill payers. </p>  <p>  My officials are aware of the report referenced and the assumptions behind reaching a 70% RES-E share . It is particularly relevant to consider this report in the context of private sector funding of renewable energy. In addition to the RESS, my Department has been working closely with industry to encourage corporate contracting for renewable electricity, which is expected to play a critical role in delivering on  Ireland&rsquo;s renewable electricity future and driving down consumer costs. </p>  <p>  It is critical that the revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines are adopted in advance of the first RESS auction taking place. The revised Guidelines, which are subject to Strategic Environmental Assessment, will provide greater clarity and certainty in relation to wind energy development and to strengthen public acceptance of further construction of onshore wind projects, protect local communities and address their genuine concerns particularly around noise, setback distances and shadow flicker. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has the lead on the Guidelines and I understand they aim to go to public consultation before the end of the year.</p></reply>

In respect of Industrial Emissions (IE) and Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licence applications, which are issued under the Environmental Protection Act 1992 (as amended), once the Agency has received an application that fully complies with statutory requirements, it has a statutory period of 8 weeks to issue a Proposed Determination (PD). Following the publication of the PD, there is further period of 28 days within which objections may be made.  If there are no objections, the Agency can issue a Final Determination (FD).  If objections are received, or a request for an oral hearing is made, the Agency has a further maximum 4 months statutory deadline before a FD must be issued.  </p><p>In respect of waste licence applications, which are issued under the Waste Management Act 1996 (as amended), the licensing procedure is a necessarily detailed process. Once an application is made to the EPA, the Agency completes an assessment of the application and submissions on the application. Once the Agency has acknowledged the application as complete, the inspector assessing the application prepares a report detailing all relevant aspects of the application, and also prepares a proposed licence, taking into account any written submissions received. The Board of the Agency then makes a PD on the licence application. It is vital, to ensure statutory compliance, that  each application is subject to the appropriate analysis, scrutiny and appraisal. This is essential to maintain the appropriate levels of control to ensure that waste is disposed of without endangering human health and also without using environmentally harmful processes and methods.</p><p>Further information on the licensing processes can be found on the EPA website at:</p><p>and </p></reply>

The current Agreements cannot be extended beyond March 2030. The costs of the extension of the concession agreements amounted to &euro;28,228 in respect of the external consultant&rsquo;s report in addition to internal departmental costs. </p>  <p>  Enet do not receive any payments in respect of the 28 Phase I MANs.  In recognition of the challenges posed in terms of commercialising and maintaining the MANs located in Phase II towns, Enet received &euro;1.2million in management fees per annum up to June 2018. Enet will not receive any further management fees with effect from June 2018. However, the company is compensated for the cost of care and maintenance of a number of the Phase II MANs and this will continue up until 2024. </p>  <p>  Enet has invested over &euro;31million of its own funds to date in maintaining, commercialising and enhancing the MANs assets. The MANs and enhancements to the MAN&rsquo;s remain in the ownership of the State. The overall fibre footprint of the MANs has increased by over 30% and the State has received approximately &euro;8.5 million to date in revenue share payments under the Concession Agreements.</p>  <p>  New clawback arrangements in respect of enhancements to the MANs under the MSE I Concession Agreement were agreed with the concessionaire on 15 March 2017.  The clawback period was reduced from the final ten years to the final five years of the Concession Agreement which is due to expire in March 2030.  There were no changes made to clawback provisions in the MSE II Concession Agreement. The purpose of the clawback arrangements is to incentivise ongoing enhancement of the MANs infrastructure by the concessionaire in the final years of the MSE Agreement.  Payments under the clawback provisions will fall due at the expiry of the MSE I Agreement in 2030, and it is expected there will be a benefit to the State from the reduction of the clawback period from ten to five years. The actual net benefit to the State will be determined by the actual enhancement expenditure by enet in the last 5 years of the contract as agreed by the Department under the terms of the MSE II Concession Agreement.  It would not be appropriate to give an estimated monetary figure as this is commercially sensitive. </p></reply>

The publication on 8 October of the Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the impacts of global warming of 1.5⁰C confirms the absolute urgency of achieving deep cuts in our greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades.    The Government has responded to this challenge by putting in place a strong policy framework underpinned by significant investment plans in climate action. Ireland's own long-term vision of a low-carbon and climate resilient economy, set out in the 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, commits to:</p>  <p>  - an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors, and</p>  <p>  - in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.</p>  <p>  The National Policy Position will be further elaborated in a new long-term low emissions strategy which must be prepared by the start of 2020, addressing long-term greenhouse gas emissions reductions to 2050. I intend that this long-term strategy will further elaborate sectoral pathways for Ireland to meet its long-term decarbonisation objectives to 2050, as set out in the National Policy Position. In light of the IPCC's conclusions, our current 2050 decarbonisation objectives must now be seen as the absolute minimum necessary for Ireland to contribute effectively to the Paris Agreement objectives.</p>  <p>  Ireland's National Mitigation Plan (NMP), published in 2017, sets out the sectoral policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective, as well as taking into account our EU and international obligations. Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve our national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p>  <p>  Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February 2018 of the National Development Plan 2018 - 2027 (NDP), will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan (NDP) will be on climate action and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with other relevant Departments and Agencies on the preparation of a National Energy and Climate Plan. </p>  <p>  Finally, I welcome the commitment shown by my colleague the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement that he intends to put in place a long-term trajectory for Carbon Tax increases out to 2030 in line with the recommendations of both the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action. </p></reply>

The Taoiseach has asked Mr Peter Smyth, the independent process auditor to the NBP procurement to review the process. Mr. Smyth will submit a report to the Taoiseach and to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. This review is taking place in parallel with the evaluation being carried out by the Department&rsquo;s procurement team on the final tender.</p><p>The premises referenced in the Questions lie close to an ongoing private commercial roll out of high speed broadband.  eir&rsquo;s rural investment in high speed broadband is an entirely commercial undertaking, and not part of the planned State Intervention network. Although the deployment is monitored under the terms of a Commitment Agreement signed between the company and my Department, it is not funded by the State and it is not planned or directed by my Department in any capacity.  </p><p>The selection of what premises are to be served under eir&rsquo;s deployment is an internal and commercial decision for that company. My Department has no statutory authority or function to intervene in the company&rsquo;s commercial decisions, nor in any decisions relating to the roll out and siting of infrastructure throughout Ireland by service providers operating in a liberalised market</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements. </p></reply>

The scheme was introduced in 2010 and requires suppliers of road transport fuel to ensure that biofuels make up a certain percentage of annual fuel sales.  It is a certificate based scheme with two certificates awarded per litre of sustainable biofuel if that biofuel is produced from wastes or residues and one certificate per litre for all other sustainable biofuels.   For each calendar year, a fuel supplier must hold sufficient biofuel obligation certificates to demonstrate compliance.  The number of certificates required is determined by the biofuel obligation rate, which is currently set at 8%.  This means that at the end of 2018, a fuel supplier must hold 8 biofuel certificates for every 92 litres of fossil fuel they place on the road transport fuel market this year. </p>  <p>  In 2017 the Biofuels Obligation Scheme resulted in over 225 million litres of biofuel being placed on the market in Ireland leading to over 7% renewable energy use in the transport sector compared to the 10% target for 2020 under the Renewable Energy Directive.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, a Policy Statement on the Biofuel Obligation Scheme was published which set out six key actions that will be undertaken in the development of the scheme. This included an increase in the biofuel obligation rate to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019 and 11% by volume from 1 January 2020. </p>  <p>The first of these changes has been enacted by S.I. No. 169 of 2018. A draft Statutory Instrument will be published on my Department's website in relation to the increase to 11% from 2020. It is my intention that this legislation will be enacted early next year.   </p></reply>

The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has a broad remit and is responsible for communications, broadcasting, postal services, energy, natural resources, climate change, waste management, air quality and environmental policy.  The day-to-day functions of the Department in carrying out its remit, therefore, involve engagement with a broad range of stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The NBP procurement process is being conducted as a &ldquo;Competitive Dialogue&rdquo; process which, by its nature, has involved a significant level of interaction with each of the bidders that participated in that process. This includes more than 230 meetings between the NBP Procurement Team and representatives of the Granahan McCourt led consortium, which includes representatives of enet, since the Competitive Dialogue process commenced in July 2016. As these meetings form part of an ongoing procurement process it is not proposed to publish further details at this time. I have not been involved in any of those meetings nor, my Department informs me, was former Minister Naughten.</p>  <p>  enet is also the Management Services Entity for the State owned Metropolitan Area Networks. As the Contracting Authority&rsquo;s Representative and in accordance with best practice in Contract Governance, my Department meets with enet on a routine basis on operational and administrative matters affecting the MANs as they arise. I will provide a schedule to the Deputy as soon as possible, of meetings between enet and senior officials in my Department, covering the period November 2015 to October 2016. I can confirm at this time that my predecessor Deputy Naughten and officials met with enet representatives on one occasion during that period, with the meeting taking place on 20 July 2016.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development hold quarterly meetings with each of the organisations responsible for the delivery of actions arising out of the 2016 Report of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, in order to obtain an update and prepare quarterly progress reports on the actions. enet is also part of the industry group Telecommunications Internet Federation (TIF) that meets collectively with the Departmental officials in relation to their specific commitments under the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce report.  The type of actions for delivery by the telecommunications operators include identifying, in consultation with Local Authorities, optimal locations for additional infrastructure to improve coverage; providing greater transparency of mobile phone contract costs for customers; and reporting on activities undertaken to optimise the performance of their networks. Discussions arising at such meetings between the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce and TIF inform regular quarterly progress reports, which are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and that of DRCD. The minutes of meetings of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Group are also published on both Departments&rsquo; websites.</p>  <p>With regards to the Irish Infrastructure Fund, officials from my Department advise of two meetings in August of this year with a representative of AMP Capital (subsidiary of AMP Limited, a company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange) who acts as the investment advisor to the Irish Infrastructure Fund (IIF) and manages it&rsquo;s investment portfolio)  . </p></reply>

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has structured this grant support based on detailed analysis of costs and willingness to pay research, and the grant level (30-35% overall installation costs) is in line with other grants offered by the SEAI.    The scheme will be subject to a six month review which will examine the uptake and the level of the grant, assess the costs associated with relevant technologies and explore opportunities for broadening the scheme as appropriate. The objective of the pilot scheme is to help build a sustainable, enduring micro generation sector in Ireland including setting appropriate safety and qualification standards for the industry.</p>  <p>  Micro generation, including micro hydro technology, was appraised as part of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a financial support scheme (payment) for micro generation can be developed. These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.</p>  <p>  While I have no statutory function in the matter, I am aware that since February 2009 Electric Ireland had offered a feed-in tariff on a commercial basis to domestic micro generators, although they subsequently decided to close the scheme to new entrants from the end of 2014. More recently, Electric Ireland extended the tariff to their existing customers until the end of 2018. To date, no other electricity supplier has chosen to provide such a tariff, to either domestic or commercial customers, although they have been invited to do so by the  Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Data provided by Electric Ireland indicates that there are currently 8 micro hydro sites still contracted under this scheme.      </p>  <p>  Finally, projects utilising micro hydro technology (as part of a wider project application)  are eligible to submit for funding under the SEAI-led Better Energy Communities scheme, details of which can be found here</p></reply>

ESB is working with a number of wave energy project developers to realise this 5MW project.    Since 2003, the project has received exchequer funding of almost &euro;780,000 including funding provided since 2009 from the Prototype Development Fund. This main focus of the Prototype Development Fund is to stimulate the development and deployment of ocean energy devices and systems. This funding has supported the overall objective of the WestWave project to demonstrate that wave energy projects can be designed, consented, developed and operated in Ireland, ultimately producing electricity to the grid. The WestWave project has established a site for a generic pre-commercial wave project off the west coast of Ireland, in Killard, Co. Clare. </p>  <p>The Westwave project had previously secured a funding commitment in principle from the NER 300 programme in July 2014. The NER 300 programme was so-called because it is funded from the sale of 300 million emission allowances from the new entrants' reserve (NER) set up for the third phase of the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). One of the conditions of the NER 300 programme was that projects must enter into operation within four years of the funding award. With the entry into operation they would start generating renewable energy. The date of entry into operation of individual projects was to take place between 2015 and 2018. However with wave and tidal energy being still at the research, development and demonstration stage globally the condition in relation to operational timelines has proved not appropriate for this project. Much more research is required to bring wave energy technology to commercial viability. Consequently it has not yet been possible to confirm a date for a final investment decision or operation. I am advised that the earliest date for operation based on the current view of technology is 2025. I am further advised that the project has to date received no funding from outside the state.</p>  <p>  It is imperative that the technical solution chosen would be appropriate for the energetic wave conditions on the west coast of Ireland.</p></reply>

The measures in the Management Plan, including the cessation of commercial fishing, was comprehensively reviewed in 2012, 2015 and again this year.  The reviews included scientific assessments from the independent Standing Scientific Committee for eels comprising scientists from a range of organisations in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department has also provided funding for IFI for a new collaborative research initiative involving IFI scientists and a number of former eel fishermen to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to longer term potential for recovery. This scientific fishery was commenced in 2016 for a period of three years.</p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) is that &ldquo;the status of eel remains critical and that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible".   The European Eel remains on the United Nations red list of critically endangered species</p>  <p>  Against this background, the Government has introduced a scheme to provide a level of restitution payment to former eel fishermen and women following consultation with the European Commission and advice from the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  Fishing for eel was by way of public licence and there is no property right attaching to such public licences. Consequently, the issue of &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; is not relevant or appropriate. </p>  <p>  As part of the consultations, enquiries were made as regards the possibility of EU funding and it was made clear that EU funding for such a measure would not be made available.   In that context, and to provide some measure of support, Exchequer funding was secured, to be disbursed over a 3 year period, to qualifying former holders of a licence or permit to fish for eel.  It is important to note that this funding was secured against a background of a large number of competing interests for public funding from all sectors in the State.  Funding has been provided to my Department for each of the years 2018-2020 and can only be disbursed on this basis.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the funding, former fishermen and women have to have held a State public licence or an ESB permit in the base year 2007.  The payment elements are calculated over the 5 reckonable years 2003 -2007.  Payments to those former fishermen and women who qualify on foot of being a licence or permit holder in the base year will be made in respect of two elements:</p>  <p>1. The first element is payment on the basis that a qualifying applicant was the holder of either a State fishing licence or an ESB permit.  It is not in respect of each licence or permit held.  This element is tax free and payment will be made in respect of each year in the period 2003-2007 that the applicant was a licence or permit holder.  Payments are weighted towards the earlier years to facilitate former fishermen and women with the longest track record of being a licensee or permit holder.</p>  <p>2. The second element is based on average annual catch over the period 2003-2007 based on the catches declared by each individual applicant in these years.</p></reply>

Green-Schools is Ireland&rsquo;s leading environmental management and education programme for schools. Over 3,900 primary, secondary and special schools in Ireland, in excess of 90% of all Irish schools, are currently participating in the programme and over 3,300 schools have been awarded at least one Green Flag. The Irish Green-Schools programme is one of the most successful within the international network. The aim of Green-Schools is to increase participants' awareness of environmental issues through classroom studies, and to transfer this knowledge into positive environmental action in the school and wider community. In addition to this, my Department also currently provides funding to Eco-Unesco for the operation of the Young Environmentalist Awards which is open to young people between the ages of 10 and 18.   </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government established a National Dialogue on Climate Action in 2017. The objectives of the National Dialogue, as agreed by Government, are to:</p>  <p>  - create awareness, engagement and motivation to act (locally, regionally and nationally) in relation to the challenges presented by climate change;</p>  <p>  - create structures and information flows to facilitate people gathering to discuss, deliberate and maximise consensus on appropriate responses to these challenges, and to enable and empower appropriate action;</p>  <p>  - establish, on a long term basis, appropriate networks for people to meet periodically to consider evidence-based inputs on the economic, social, behavioural, environmental and public aspects of climate and energy policy; and </p>  <p>  - provide regular input, through the NDCA, into the prioritisation and implementation of climate and energy policy which can be reported and monitored at local, regional, and national levels. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Environment Protection Agency to implement the National Dialogue, including the following initiatives:</p>  <p>  - regional and local gatherings which will be held across Ireland to engage with local communities on the challenges of addressing climate change. A pilot Regional Gathering was held on 23 June in Athlone, with a second event scheduled to take place in Tralee, County Kerry, on 10 November;</p>  <p>  - professionally moderated and accessible expert lectures/debates on key policy issues, hosted by the Environmental Protection Agency; and</p>  <p>  - the Tidy Towns Climate Action award, sponsored by my Department</p>  <p>  Building on the existing Green Schools Programme, my Department and the Environmental Education Unit of An Taisce launched a National Climate Change Action and Awareness Programme in 2017. A key initiative of the National Dialogue, this programme aims to raise awareness of climate change among students; support them and their communities in undertaking climate actions; and educate teachers about the science of climate change. The programme comprises:</p>  <p>  - a Green-Schools Climate Change Ambassador Programme. This was launched in September 2017, with the aim of increasing awareness of climate change and promoting climate actions nationally. 108 members of the public were selected as ambassadors for 2018. The Ambassadors received training in the areas of climate science and communications. Recruitment for the 2019 programme is currently underway;</p>  <p>  - a Climate Action Week, with all schools invited to participate in a national Green-Schools Climate Action Week in October each year. The week focuses on encouraging schools, teachers and pupils to get involved in climate-related events and to make &lsquo;climate pledges&rsquo; via social media to raise awareness;</p>  <p>  - Climate Change Teacher Training seminars, run during the school year, to provide key information to strengthen teachers' own knowledge on climate change, followed by practical guidance and ideas on how to introduce the topic into the classroom, along with outlines of curriculum links, lesson plans and resources. This course aims to raise teachers' awareness and build their knowledge and confidence. An online resource is being developed; and</p>  <p>- a Climate Change Resource for second level to be published this month, with work progressing on a resource for primary level. This comprehensive resource links to specific curriculum areas and contains practical lesson plans, activities and information. The resource has been developed with the advice and support of the Junior Cycle for Teachers, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and several teachers participating in the Green Schools programme.</p></reply>

The Lessees are Shell E&amp;P Ireland Ltd (45% interest and Operatorship), Equinor Energy Ireland Ltd (36.5% interest) and Vermilion Energy Ireland Ltd (18.5% interest).   The Lessees are joint and severally liable for their obligations under the Lease and are required to fully indemnify the Minister against any claim arising out of their operations under the Lease. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Lessees must also obtain and maintain such insurances as are required by the Minister in relation to their obligations under the Lease. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a guarantee must be given by the ultimate holding company of each Lessee, or such other person approved by the Minister in writing, and must be in place for the duration of the Lease. A guarantor guarantees payment of all moneys which are at any time due, owing or incurred to the Minister by the Lessee pursuant to the Lease. As the liability of each Lessee is joint and several, the Minister can if necessary pursue any one or more of the Lessees in respect of any liability under the Lease and, as a consequence make a demand on all or any guarantee. </p>  <p>  During the course of a review of documentation associated with the Lease it came to my Department&rsquo;s attention that the guarantee in respect of Shell E&amp;P Ireland Ltd is being provided by a subsidiary in the Royal Dutch Shell Group. My Department wrote to Shell E&amp;P Ireland Ltd on 22 January 2018 placing the Lessee on notice of the need to address this matter.</p>  <p>  Given the provisions and operation of the Lease in respect of insurance, indemnification, guarantees and joint and several liability, my Department is satisfied that there is sufficient cover provided by the Lessees in respect of potential liabilities associated with the Lease and that the State is not exposed to such potential liabilities.</p></reply>

This includes Regulations of the type specified by section 10(2). That section allows me to widen the scope of the Act to include laws set out at section 10(1), which were excluded at the time of enactment. In order to make Regulations under section 10(2), I must have formed the opinion that technology has advanced sufficiently and is widely available; that adequate procedures and practices have developed; or that such a change would be in the public interest. I am also required to undertake consultation with such Ministers that, in my view, have interest or responsibility in relation to the laws currently excluded. This is an important consideration as none of the excluded laws set out at section 10(1) of the Act relate to policy areas within my remit, and in that regard it would not be appropriate for me to act unilaterally.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.2185.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600092#WRKK06100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 853 and 854 together. </p>  <p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high speed broadband.  When this Government came into office this had risen to 52%.  Today, 74% of premises can access high speed broadband services. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p>  <p>  - The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p>  <p>  - The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  - The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll-out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p>  <p>  According to the latest map data for Q3 2018, there are some 83,500 premises in Mayo. More than 37,000 (44%) of these premises fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention. Some 37,000 (44%) of premises fall within a BLUE area - where commercial operators are currently delivering or plan to deliver this service. More than 9,500 (12%) fall within a LIGHT BLUE are and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment. This data has been verified by my Department.</p>  <p>  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage, with evaluation ongoing of the final tender submission received on 18 September. The Taoiseach has asked Mr Peter Smyth, the independent process auditor to the NBP procurement to review the process. Mr. Smyth will submit a report to the Taoiseach and to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. This review is taking place in parallel to the evaluation being carried out by the Department&rsquo;s procurement team on the final tender. </p>  <p>  Under a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high speed broadband. According to data for Q3 2018 submitted by eir to my Department the company has passed almost 210,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. This data is to be published on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly.</p>  <p>  For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements.</p></reply>

This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan.  The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p>  <p>  - The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p>  <p>  - The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  - The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 42,000 premises in Cavan. Nearly 17,000 (40%) fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention. Some 23,500 (56%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be served by commercial providers, while some 1,500 (4%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 33,000 premises in Monaghan. Almost 16,000 (48%) fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention. Just over 16,000 (49%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be served by commercial providers, while some 1,000 (3%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment.</p>  <p>  These figures are based on data for Q3 2018, which is to be published on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly. </p>  <p>  Information on categories of specific premises can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.broadband.gov.ie, by entering the relevant eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map.  For those premises who fall within eir's commercial deployment to 300,000 premises further detail is provided on its website www.fibrerollout.ie.  </p>  <p>  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage, with evaluation ongoing of the final tender submission received on 18 September. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has asked Mr Peter Smyth, the independent process auditor to the NBP procurement to review the process.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.2206.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600093#WRLL02000"><p>The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy for the sustainable development of our offshore renewable energy resources. Offshore renewable energy covers a number of technology types and includes wind (fixed and floating), wave and tidal, all of which rely on harnessing the motion of wind or water to generate energy.  Of these technology types fixed offshore wind has reached the commercial stage, while floating wind, wave and tidal technology are still at the experimental stage globally. Floating wind has the potential to be deployed in deeper waters and as such could have potential for development off the south and west coasts of Ireland. Bottom fixed wind turbines are limited to relatively shallow waters. To date, Ireland has only one offshore fixed wind farm generating electricity in Irish waters.  The Strategic Environmental Assessment that underpinned the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind could be sustainably developed in Irish waters in the period to 2030. An interim review of the OREDP was published in May and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie. The Offshore Renewable Energy Steering Group, which oversees the implementation of the OREDP will now consider the recommendations of the review and continue the work of implementing the actions and enablers set out in the Plan.</p>  <p>  Between 2014 and 2017 capital funding of &euro;17.7 million was allocated by my Department under the OREDP for research and development of offshore renewable energy technology, with a further &euro;4.5 million allocated in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) was approved by Government in July and is now  subject to the EU state aid approval process. It is expected the first RESS auction will be held in 2019. The new Scheme has been designed to incentivise sufficient new renewable electricity generation to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU wide renewable energy target of 32% for 2030. Technology diversity, including solar PV and offshore wind, will occur naturally as the scheme matures and certain intervention levers may be used within each auction round to promote certain policy objectives such as community participation, community ownership and diversifying the renewable energy mix.</p>  <p>  Legislative proposals have been led by the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government to draft the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill, including provisions to address the absence of a regulatory framework to regulate offshore renewable energy developments beyond the limits of the foreshore (12 nautical miles). If we are to attract investment in the offshore renewable energy sector, it is critical that a robust, streamlined consenting regime is provided to regulate activities in the maritime area.</p></reply>

The Manual sets out design guidance and standards for constructing new and reconfiguring existing urban roads and streets in Ireland.  It aims to end the practice of designing streets as traffic corridors and instead focuses on the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users.  DMURS emphasises the role of streets as social spaces, where people come first and uses practical examples from Irish cities and towns to show how these issues can be designed for and managed successfully.  The transformation envisaged is not to the total exclusion of the car but is rather about achieving a better balance in how our urban roads and streets are designed and used. </p>  <p>  This Manual represents a major change in the design of urban roads and streets and its use is mandatory both in the design of new urban roads and street schemes as well as in instances where significant upgrades are being designed. </p>  <p>  Section 5.4.1 of the Manual stipulates that it is mandatory to carry out a Road Safety Audit on any permanent change to the road layout on National Roads and Transport Infrastructure Ireland has published standards in that regard.  In addition, the standards are commended to roads authorities for use in preparation of their own road schemes on Regional or Local roads. </p>  <p>  Also, my Department requires that Road Safety Audits and Road User Audits are undertaken by roads authorities (i.e. City and County Councils) on certain categories of road schemes funded or co-funded by my Department.  In that regard, it should be noted that since the revision of the arrangements for the retention of Local Property Tax in 2015, the Dublin Councils no longer receive any grant assistance from my Department under the main grant categories.  Consideration of whether a road safety audit should be carried out on Hillcrest Road, Sandyford would be wholly and solely a matter for Dun Laoghaire - Rathdown County Council.</p>  <p>  DMURS was originally launched in 2013 and is currently being updated through the inclusion of some supplementary material towards providing additional clarity.  It is intended to launch the updated document, along with a dedicated website, in the near future.</p></reply>

Decisions on whether to grant permission for the carriage of munitions are guided by the views of other relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Justice.

The scheme aims to assist with the cost difference in purchasing a WAV or converting a vehicle to fulfil the WAV requirements. It is open to all SPSV drivers, with grants offered on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>  <p>  My Department set a goal of reaching a 10% market share for accessible SPSV's by 2020.  As of October this year we have met this goal.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to increasing the number of WAVs within our SPSV fleet and supporting the NTA in the administration of the WAV Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  The NTA are currently conducting a review of the SPSV industry. It is expected that this will be completed by end 2018.  Where any NTA recommendation in the review were to relate to matters of policy or potential legislative change, these would require further consideration before final decision.</p></reply>

My Department is represented on all relevant cross-Departmental coordination structures, and an internal Departmental Committee on Brexit meets on a monthly basis to oversee the Department's analyses and planning as the negotiations progress. </p>  <p>  Contingency planning in relation to Brexit at both a national and an EU level is focused on preparing for a no-deal scenario or so-called &ldquo;disorderly Brexit&rdquo; and on  a central case scenario involving a transition period based on the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; and agreement on the future relationship.</p>  <p>  The Department has continually stressed the importance that stakeholders, including in the aviation and maritime sectors, take all necessary steps within their control to prepare for Brexit, including the importance of undertaking contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations. We have also advised stakeholders to refer to the European Commission&rsquo;s published Notices to Stakeholders in the field of transport.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my department continue to consult and engage with key Aviation stakeholders via the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, and other fora, on all matters relating to Brexit planning in the aviation sector. </p>  <p>  The implications of Brexit for air and sea transport will only become clear once the negotiations have been completed and the future relationship between the EU and the UK have been decided. However, we do not anticipate that direct aviation services from Ireland to continental Europe by community carriers will be affected post-Brexit, even in a no-deal scenario. In terms of sea-travel, my Department and other relevant Government Departments are working with the key affected ports impacted by Brexit in making arrangements and planning to have the necessary facilities in place to deal with anticipated additional controls and checks. Planning in relation to the implications for a no-deal scenario is also underway. Similar preparations are underway in our airports.  </p></reply>

The SLA is scheduled to be reviewed in the coming months. The Air Corps provides services to the Irish Coast Guard as set out in Annex II of this agreement. At the request of the IRCG, the Air Corps rotary wing, on an as available basis, may provide assistance as follows:- </p><p>- SAR search support;</p><p>- On-scene air Co-ordinator</p><p>- Island Medevacs and mountain rescues when the IRCG helicopters are unable to respond;</p><p>- Maritime surveillance; </p><p>- Partake in joint training exercises as required e.g. annual IRCG training exercises with Mountain Rescue Teams; and </p><p>- Technical advice as appropriate.</p><p>In 2018 so far the IRCG has received support in the form of 5 surveillance flights, 1 top cover flight and 1 SAR flight from Air Corps fixed wing assets. No rotary flights were required.

This Review was delivered to me at the end of August and provides a very helpful assessment which is both specific about short terms actions as well as identifying further work that needs to be undertaken to assist in decision-making for the longer term to 2050. To ensure that there is an open approach to the policy options for Dublin Airport, including any decision on a third terminal, I have just commenced a process of consultation on the Review in which all stakeholders will have an opportunity to set out their views. When I have all the views and information available to me, I will carefully consider the issues and make recommendations to Government in early 2019.  </p>  <p>  The Review took into account the policy objectives of supporting the roles of Cork and Shannon Airports as key tourism and business gateways for their regions, along with the development of Dublin as a secondary hub.  This is in line with the National Aviation Policy which recognises the roles that both Cork and Shannon play in the regions.  The smaller regional airports in Donegal, Knock, Kerry and Waterford are dealt with separately under the Regional Airports Programme 2015-2019.  As part of the negotiations on the Budget, the deputy may be aware, that I secured an increase in the allocation for the Programme for 2019 &ndash; going from around &euro;13m in 2018 to around &euro;21m in 2019. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan 2017-2027 support high quality International connectivity investments consistent with sectorial priorities already defined through the National Aviation Policy. Significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s airports, and in Dublin Airport, as Ireland&rsquo;s main international gateway, will play a major role in safeguarding and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international connectivity which is fundamental to our international competitiveness, trading performance and attractiveness to foreign direct investment.  Our focus remains is on ensuring that we have the optimum network for Ireland given the importance of international connectivity for the well-being of the country.  That involves having a strong national airport in our capital city, as well as strong regional airports in Cork and Shannon, complemented by the smaller regional airports.  I do not accept the view that it is a question of developing either Dublin or the other airports around the country. They all have their roles to play for the Irish economy.</p></reply>

From within that allocation, funding was sourced for the Green Public Transport Fund, which was established to support the uptake of low carbon, energy efficient technologies within the public transport sector. In Budget 2019, &euro;7m has been assigned for the Carbon Reduction Programme; from this allocation funding will be made available under the Green Public Transport Fund as required and in accordance with approved projects.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Fund is intended to support piloting and uptake of energy-efficient and alternatively fuelled technologies for PSO operators within the bus fleet and small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector, as well as bridging the price differential between such technologies and conventionally fuelled vehicles. No drawdown from the Fund has yet taken place to support the bus trials but to date three contracts have been successfully awarded. The Fund also supports the transition of the national SPSV fleet to alternative technologies through the establishment of the Electric Vehicle SPSV Grant Scheme. By the end of October 2018, &euro;198,117 had been drawn down from the Fund to pay grants under this scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.2410.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600096#WROO03900"><p>Reducing carbon emissions is a national challenge and requires concerted efforts across the country. In this regard the<i>National Mitigation Plan</i>was published in 2017 and begins to set Ireland on a pathway towards decarbonisation with over 100 actions to reduce emissions from the electricity generation, built environment, agricultural and transport sectors. </p><p>Although Ireland's emission reduction targets are national in nature the transport sector will of course have to play a significant role in the mitigation effort. I am acutely aware of the specific challenges we face where travel demand is growing and fossil fuel use is firmly established. To address this challenge, emission reductions and energy efficiencies are being strongly pursued through four main channels. </p><p>Firstly, we are increasing investment in the public and sustainable transport to support modal shift and accommodate growing travel demand.  An efficient public transport sector is a key priority in meeting our climate change goals.  The NDP has committed &euro;8.6 billion to public transport over the next 10 years to 2027.  Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to providing an alternative to the private car:  not only to reduce congestion and emissions but also to enable the transport sector to cater, in an environmentally sustainable way, for the increasing demands associated with growing population and employment.  Major projects planned include: BusConnects, which will transform the bus network in our cities with new and expanded bus routes, greatly improved bus access, designated segregated cycle lanes and park and ride facilities; investment in the DART Expansion Programme; and the MetroLink.  We also have multi-annual urban Cycling and Walking Infrastructure investment underway for our main cities. </p><p>Secondly, we are encouraging a transition away from fossil fuels.  In the '<i>National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland</i>' I firmly outlined my ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland would be zero-emission capable. To support this ambition and a Programme for Partnership Government commitment, an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Taskforce was jointly convened by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Phase 1 of the Taskforce considered a range of measures and options to accelerate the deployment of EVs.  Arising from their recommendations further generous incentives for EVs were announced as part of Budgets 2018 and 2019 aimed at assisting all drivers in purchasing hybrid or electric cars, including significant toll reductions.  Phase 1 of the LEV Taskforce is now complete and the LEV Taskforce Progress Report is available on my Department's website.  Phase 2 has begun its work and will consider the options available to Government to support the deployment of other alternative fuels, namely natural gas, biomethane, hydrogen, and synthetic/paraffinic fuels, with a particular emphasis on the heavy duty vehicle sector.</p><p>Thirdly, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme plays a major role in decarbonising the road transport sector in Ireland.  The penetration of biofuels as a share of road transport energy has increased significantly over recent years from a share of 4 % in 2010 to 8% (by volume) from 2017.  It is intended that the biofuel obligation scheme will be incrementally increased on a sustainable basis to help meet the renewable transport target of 10% by 2020 as set under the Renewable Energy Directive. The obligation rate will increase to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019; and again to 11% by volume from 1 January 2020.</p><p>Finally, an important role will be played by more efficient standards for vehicles.  Ireland continues to push strongly for better EU vehicles standards, seeking greater ambition in regulations that ensure vehicles registered in Europe are increasingly more efficient and less emitting.  It is through better technology and improved efficiency that carbon emissions generated by vehicles can be decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth.</p><p>The Deputy specifically references reduction of transport emissions in Galway city, where Galway County Council and Galway City Council, in partnership with the National Transport Authority (NTA), have developed the Galway Transport Strategy (GTS): an Integrated Transport Strategy for Galway City and Environs. The NTA is also working closely with Galway on the transport elements of the Metropolitan Area Strategic Plans (MASPs), Regional, Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) and aligning these with metropolitan transport strategies. The integration of land-use and transportation is essential in creating sustainable city living. The alignment of settlement and land-use patterns with an integrated transportation strategy can provide opportunities to reduce car dependency and allow for greater investment in alternative means of travel including public transport, walking and cycling. It also delivers considerable benefits in terms of reduced congestion, reduced emissions, enhanced health and well-being and has benefits for the public realm. </p></reply>

In all cases, where such a disclosure is made and referred to Tusla, a social worker will approach a meeting with the child on the basis of building a rapport.  Once the social worker has developed an understanding of the child&rsquo;s communication capabilities, he or she will be asked to tell their story in their own words.  The environment is supportive and child friendly.  The social worker will facilitate the child&rsquo;s return to his or her carers.</p>  <p>  The venues for such meetings can be in the child&rsquo;s own home or school. However, on occasion other suitable locations may have to be used depending on the level of urgency and/or the safety of the child.

The child&rsquo;s family, with the aid of advice and support from social workers and other suitably qualified professionals, are often able to provide the most appropriate emotional support needed.  However, in situations when further support is required, social workers or social care leaders can remain in contact with the child and their family over an extended period of time.  This may involve working with the Garda&iacute; and other agencies while a case is being investigated, or liaising with local General Practitioner Services and/or Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).</p>  <p>  If a child is linked in with other organisations they can avail of further sources of support. The social work department can act as consultant to these organisations in the provision of advice and support.</p>  <p>  The most meaningful support to children comes from sources known to them before the disclosure was made.  Other sources of support are called upon as required in individual circumstances. </p></reply>

Over the last four Budgets (2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019) investment in childcare has increased by nearly 117% which reflects the emphasis being placed on improving access to affordable, high quality services.</p><p>This investment includes funding of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the After School Childcare (ASCC) schemes.  CCS is a childcare programme targeted to support parents on a low income to avail of reduced childcare costs.  ASCC is designed to support parents on eligible training courses, as well as certain categories of parents returning to work, by providing subsidised childcare places. Eligible children must be under 15 years of age to avail of these supports.  In September 2017, I increased significantly the subsidy paid under CCS to make it more attractive for low income families.</p><p>When the Affordable Childcare Scheme is rolled out, school-age childcare services who are registered with Tusla will be able to avail of subsidies under the new scheme.  As Tusla-registration will be a requirement, I will shortly be introducing regulations (under the Child Care Act 1991) to allow for the registration of school-age childcare providers.</p><p>There has been little change in the proportion of childcare provision that is community-based.  According to the Pobal annual sector profile, which is carried out on my Department's behalf, in 2013 approximately 26% of childcare services were community services. The latest data indicates that the proportion in 2018 is approximately 24%.</p><p>The annual survey suggests that supply of childcare places currently broadly matches demand.  My Department is committed to keeping capacity in the sector under review.  Staff from City and County Childcare Committees are available across the country to assist parents who may have difficulty in meeting their childcare needs.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government included a number of commitments to strengthen supports for school-age childcare.  My Department chaired a group with the Department of Education and Skills to progress those commitments in a coherent way and to align relevant bodies of work under our respective areas of responsibility.  The result of this work, the Action Plan for School Age Childcare, was published in 2017.</p><p>Since the Action Plan was published, much progress has been made.  An expert working group on School Age Childcare has developed recommendations for my department on standards, which will be progressed in 2019.  The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines to assist school authorities on how their premises might be utilised for school-age childcare and other activities where it can be facilitated by the school patron/trustees.</p><p>My Department has also provided a programme of capital grants, uptake of which has been very high.  In 2018 there were 45<b></b>applications with a value of &euro;761,282 approved for the creation of 807 new School Age places under the school-age capital grant scheme.  Additionally, 54 Essential Maintenance and Repair projects have been funded in 2018 for Community School Age services to the value of  &euro;250,763 under the capital programme.</p><p>While youth groups may choose to provide school-age childcare or other services, to date evidence of this is limited.  Youth clubs funded by my Department under the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme must be volunteer-led.  While some staff-led targeted youth services are co-located with pre-schools and/or after-schools, the youth funding is not in any way linked to the operation of these services.</p></reply>

CEHOP was developed by Oberstown and is a bespoke model for the delivery of care programmes.</p><p>When a child arrives in Oberstown, his/her care programme is based on the child&rsquo;s leaving date.  Depending on the length of their remand or detention, Oberstown develops plans based on the child's short, medium and long-term needs, always focusing on their ultimate return and reintegration into the community and reducing the risk of re-offending.</p><p>Preparation for leaving involves practical programmes that are regularly reviewed and constantly supervised.  Placement Planning Meetings take place at regular intervals throughout the child&rsquo;s time in Oberstown.  These cover all aspects of the child's care including accommodation, living skills, finances, work, education and health.  Oberstown involves all relevant parties which includes the young person themselves as well as the key people in their lives such as parents/family, carers, as well as representatives from care, education, health and other relevant external agencies.</p></reply>

These provide for the welfare of the child, including their health, education, assessment of need, care planning, supervision of placement, contact with family, general care practices, care records, and safety precautions.  Children, depending on their identified needs, may be placed  in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, high support or special care or other placement types.  The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care.  A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits.  There are safeguards surrounding each child care placement, whether foster or residential care and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA).  Private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against National Standards.  Inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by my officials.  The overview of these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children who are at risk.</p>  <p>  Tusla has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team. This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. Tusla provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers. Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note. The reports provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.</p>  <p>   Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that children in care have access to independent advocacy supports, such as the organisation Empowering People in Care (EPIC).  Children in care also have access to the complaints mechanism in Tulsa, and may make complaints, or be assisted to make complaints, about their care to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.</p>  <p>  In the context of the Child Care Act 1991, my Department has policy responsibility for children under 18 years of age who present as &ldquo;out of home&rdquo; without their parent or guardian.  Children under the age of 16 who present as homeless without their parent or guardian are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care or provided with a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 which deals with accommodation for homeless children.  Children who are homeless and in emergency accommodation are in the care of their parent or guardian.  Where there are no welfare or protection concerns, Tusla's role is to provide family support if it is required.</p></reply>

These children may be taken into the care of Tusla or, in the case of children aged 16 or 17, they may be provided with accommodation under section 5 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Where children are homeless as part of a family experiencing homelessness, my Department is working closely with Tusla to provide supports to mitigate the challenges faced by these parents and children.  These include the introduction of free childcare for the children of families experiencing homelessness.  As part of the scheme a daily meal is provided for each child, the cost of which is included in the subvention rate. The scheme is also designed to help those transitioning from homelessness to permanent accommodation.</p>  <p>  Tusla works together with other statutory and voluntary agencies to provide services and supports to children, young people and families experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres, part funded by Tusla, are working with people who are experiencing homelessness and many have developed local responses to the needs of families in emergency accommodation.  These include, by way of example, family fun days, homework support, after school programmes, play therapy and transport services.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties associated with homelessness and school attendance, Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service offers a number of supports to children (and families) experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Tusla and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) have agreed a joint protocol to facilitate an inter-agency response to the many challenges posed by homelessness.  The main aim of the joint protocol is to work in partnership to address the family support needs of homeless families and to promote inter-agency cooperation.</p>  <p>  As part of the protocol, Tusla provides support to the DHRE&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; assessment centres.  Here the role of Tusla staff is to participate as required with regard to issues involving child protection and welfare, educational welfare and Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) services.</p>  <p>  Referrals received from Case Workers located in Assessment Centres are responded to as appropriate.  The Tusla Homelessness Liaison Officer provides broad-based supports to the centres.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances.  Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians.  Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, my concern is that we minimise and then eliminate the problem of homelessness.  In the meantime, I will continue to support measures to help those affected, to the greatest degree possible within my area of responsibility.</p></reply>

As of the 31 August 2018, of the children in care, 92% were in foster care nationally; there were 4,005 children in general foster care, 1,642 in relative care and 366 children were in a residential care placement, with the remaining children in other care placements appropriate to their assessed needs.</p>  <p>  For children who cannot live either at home or in an alternative family environment such as foster care, there are a number of types of residential care settings that may be appropriate, of which secure care is one type.</p>  <p>  A very small number of children (2%) are in other care placements.  Such placements can include supported lodgings, at home under a care order, detention centre/prison, youth homeless facilities, other residential centres e.g. therapeutic, disability, residential assessment, designated mother and baby units.</p>  <p>  Foster care is the preferred option for children who have been received into care.  This can be as a result of abuse and/or neglect and their parents' inability to care for them due to a combination of difficulties in their own lives.  In recent years, more than 90% of children in care were in a foster care placement.</p>  <p>  There are regular area recruitment campaigns to meet foster care demands.  Fostering teams are responsible for the recruitment and assessment of foster carers.  When an assessment is complete, a report is presented to the Foster Care Committee who decide whether or not to approve the applicant.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and retention of an appropriate range of foster carers is part of Tusla's business plan.

Against this backdrop, my Department has engaged in a reform programme to ensure quality-effective, value for money services that are evidence-informed and designed to secure the best outcomes for young people.</p>  <p>  In this regard you will be aware that the targeted schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review. The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  These included the merging the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund 1 and 2 and Local Drugs Task Force Projects into a single youth funding scheme. The work on the development of this new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the Value for Money and Policy Review of Youth Programmes on a transitional basis in 2019 and fully in 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.

The schemes include the Youth Service Grant Scheme under which funding is made available on an annual basis to thirty national and major regional youth organisations, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports youth work activities at a local level and the Youth Information Centre Scheme which funds twenty-five Youth Information Centres.</p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020, published in 2015 was developed in close consultation with statutory youth interests and the voluntary youth organisations and services that work with young people.  The strategy sets out Government&rsquo;s aims for young people, aged 10 to 24 years, so that they are active and healthy, achieving their full potential in learning and development, safe and protected from harm, have economic security and opportunity and are connected and contributing to their world.</p></reply>

This measure refines the measure introduced last year and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years). This delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  The upper age limit of 5 years and 6 months for completing the ECCE programme was set in consultation with senior officials from the Early Years Education Policy Unit in the Department of Education and Skills and is consistent with the law in Ireland with regard to school start age and the associated policy of the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  A part of the criteria for assessing any application for an exemption to this upper age limit is whether a child has already availed of the full ECCE provision. Every application is considered on its own merits having regard to the individual circumstances pertaining and the legislative requirements around school starting age and any extension where full eligibility has been availed of under the programme will only be considered in very exceptional circumstances.</p></reply>

My department is represented on the Action Plan 2018 - 2022 inter-departmental working group, and has responsibility for several key deliverables identified in the action plan, such as the development of dedicated coordinator posts for Irish language in the early years sector. </p>  <p>  It must be noted that the availability or otherwise of some essential training through Irish (such as FAR First Aid Training, HACCP, Manual Handling training) is not a matter for my Department. However, some training is taking place through Irish language medium in these areas on a local level, in some cases supported by local City / County Childcare Committees, in some cases by organisations such as Comhar Na&iacute;onra&iacute; na Gaeltachta (CNNG). </p>  <p>  CNNG provide my Department&rsquo;s programme of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) training through the medium of Irish. My department is in consultation with Mary Immaculate College / University of Limerick to explore the possibility of provision of the LINC (Leadership for Inclusion) programme through Irish.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is not aware of specialist courses in immersion methodology for childcare practitioners and directors of na&iacute;onra&iacute;.</p>  <p>  Further education programmes for the early years sector in Ireland are awarded by QQI (Quality and Qualifications Ireland) at levels 5 or 6 on the NFQ (National Framework of Qualifications). Degree programmes are offered by Higher Education Institutions at level 7 or level 8 on the NFQ (ordinary level and honours level degree programmes respectively).</p>  <p>  The QQI major award in Early Childhood Care and Education (NFQ level 5) comprises 8 modules, with 4 core modules which are mandatory. Each module is a minor award in itself.  There are up to 14 modules which learners may choose from to make up the entire major award, of which &ldquo;Irish for Pre-school Services&rdquo; is one.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing early years sector workers with an opportunity to complete the &ldquo;Irish for Pre-school Services&rdquo; level 5 award module as a supplementary award can be estimated as not less than &euro;8.75 million. However, it is unlikely that this figure would represent the whole cost. As availability of the &ldquo;Irish for Pre-school Services&rdquo; level 5 minor award to learners is currently very limited, it is possible that additional costs would be incurred in order to increase availability of the programme of learning. Rapid expansion of provision would potentially lead to concerns about the quality of delivery, would require coordination with education providers and necessitate a long lead-in time.</p>  <p>  The cost of providing a specific programme of learning in Irish language and immersion education for students of Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) degree programmes (awards at Level 7 and Level 8 on the NFQ) is not known and cannot be estimated. Extensive consultation with the education providers would be required. Also, my Department does not have figures on the current numbers of students of ECEC degree programmes. </p>  <p>  An alternative would be to tailor other programmes of learning in Irish language and culture for the early years sector. Based on the costs of current programmes, costs would be not less than &euro;11 million (for the Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge [TEG]) or &euro;18.6 million (based on the QQI level 5 minor award in Irish offered by Gaelchult&uacute;r). Again, it is likely there would be issues surrounding availability of courses, quality of provision and also the need to tailor programmes for the Early Years sector.</p></reply>

In terms of wage-setting generally, however, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through its responsibilities for industrial relations matters, has a role with regard to relations between businesses and employers and their employees, and in relation to wage-setting more particularly through mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements , Joint Labour Committees and Sectoral Employment Orders, in the context of  the industrial relations and wage bargaining spheres.  Matters therefore, which do not arise from any unlawful deductions from wages but rather to any knock-on impact on earnings of employees arising from cost-savings measures implemented by employers, would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>The Payment of Wages Act 1991 establishes a range of rights for all employees in relation to payment of wages, one of which is protection against unlawful deductions from wages.  However, section 5 of the Act permits an employer to make the following deductions (or receive the following payments) from the wages of an employee :</p><p>(a) any deduction (or payment) required or authorised in legislation; </p><p>(b) any deduction or payment required or authorised by a term of the employee&rsquo;s contract; and</p><p>(c)  any deduction agreed to in writing in advance by the employee.  </p><p>Any change to an employment contract must be agreed between the employer and the employee. The requirement for both the employer's and the employee's consent to changes in the terms of the contract is part of contract law.  It is also important to note that the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 would continue to apply even in a situation where a negotiated reduction might be agreed between the parties.</p><p>The Payment of Wages Act provides that, where an employee considers that there may have been a contravention of the Act, the employee may submit a complaint to the Workplace Relations  Commission (WRC) within 6 months of the date of the alleged contravention The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section of the WRC provides information on employees&rsquo; rights and how to obtain redress if an employee considers that their employment rights may have been infringed.

There are currently 2,500 in receipt of diet supplement at a cost of &euro;1.4 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of a review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute commissioned by the Department during 2013, the scheme has been closed to new applicants from 1 February 2014.  The research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme can be met from within one-third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate which was then paid at &euro;186 per week.  The weekly rate of SWA has increased to &euro;196 further to Budget 2018.  The diet supplement scheme was discontinued for new applicants on the basis of this evidence. </p>  <p>  Existing recipients continue to receive the diet supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change.

It will, in particular, enable those people with the JobPath service to not only continue to receive the personalized employment counselling and job search support provided by their JobPath personal advisors but also to avail of a CE placement which will provide valuable occupational activity and work experience. </p>  <p>  Application for participation on CE by JobPath customers is entirely voluntary and at their discretion. However, continued engagement with the JobPath service is a condition of opting to avail of both schemes. </p>  <p>  The JobPath service has been adapted to cater for those who opt to take up a CE Scheme and all meetings and activities are scheduled to take account of the Scheme commitments. For example if a person is committed to participate in the employment scheme for 5 mornings per week, any JobPath appointments and other interventions will be scheduled for the afternoons. The JobPath service providers will continue to provide all the necessary supports. </p>  <p>  I note your concerns regarding travel and health issues of this customer. </p>  <p>  The JobPath contract with the service provider stipulates that a person should not have to travel more than 60 minutes in normal circumstances to attend an appointment. Where a person has transport difficulties, the JobPath company can assist the person with travel arrangements tailoring the service around their particular travel requirements. Travel expenses, excluding taxi fares, can also be reimbursed depending on the circumstances. </p>  <p>  If a jobseeker feels he/she is unable to participate in an activation service due to health issues they should contact their local Intreo Centre to explore if an illness related social welfare payment may be more appropriate, such as disability allowance, illness benefit, or invalidity pension. However, given the customer has availed of a CE placement, I am confident that by engaging with Turas Nua on these issues the situation can be improved.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Currently this is paid at 50% of the purchase price, to a max of &euro;500 per aid and a maximum of two appliances in any 4 year period.  Repairs to hearing aids can also be claimed for under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The grant was increased on a number of occasions in the late 1990&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s to reflect the cost of the new digital technology being introduced during that period.  The grant was paid at a maximum of &euro;830 per aid (&euro;1,660 for 2) with a frequency period of 2 years. </p>  <p>  This was reduced a number of times since 2009, under FEMPI the grant reduced from &euro;830 to &euro;760 per aid.  Then in 2012, it reduced to &euro;500 per aid and the frequency of replacement was extended from 2 years to 4 years.  These changes were introduced to reflect the reducing cost of digital technology and the increased reliability and longevity of the newer digital devices.  </p>  <p>  Applications for hearing aids have increased by 70% since 2015, due in part to the extension of the scheme to the self-employed in March 2017.  </p>  <p>  The potential increased expenditure resulting from reducing the frequency period from 4 to 3 years will depend of the uptake by customers.  This is difficult to accurately project, as if hearing aids are working well and proving reliable, as many digital devices continue to do for considerably longer than 4 years, people are unlikely to want to incur unnecessary expenditure.  It is estimated that currently circa 25% of customers replace their hearing aids every 4 years.</p>  <p>  In 2016 there were over 9,000 applications under the medical appliance scheme with some 16,000 hearing aids grant approved, at a cost of &euro;7.5 million.  If 25% of the customers who got aids in 2016 re-applied in 2019 as opposed to 2020, the additional cost in 2019 could be circa &euro;2 million. </p>  <p>  Increasing the grant amount from &euro;500 to &euro;600 per aid could potentially increase the annual cost by 20% from &euro;10.3 million to &euro;12.4 million per annum, based on 2017 applications numbers and cost. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The programme helps break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.  Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed-term.  These placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  There are participation limits in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme.</p>  <p>  A number of new conditions were introduced on CE in July 2017 to further support progression and broaden access to CE to a wider range of people.  In general all CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years will be for 1 year &ndash; however CE participants, working towards a major educational award, can seek to extend participation by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification.  In addition, those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for three years.</p>  <p>  An overall lifetime limit of 6 years will apply to all CE participants (7 years for those from a disability payment).   A person may re-qualify for CE after 12 months of being in receipt of a qualifying payment, provided they have not reached their lifetime limit. </p>  <p>  Participants over age 62 are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to availability of places on the SSS, satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.   The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are subject to limitation criteria. </p>  <p>  On the other hand, T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which aims to provide short-term work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract, which is a maximum of 12 months, was set to reflect a number of inter-related elements which ensured the following:</p>  <p>  (a)  that the number of placements available were open to those on the live register,</p>  <p>  (b)  that weaknesses identified in other work programmes resulting from longer duration placements were not replicated in T&uacute;s, and</p>  <p>  (c)  to ensure that T&uacute;s was in line with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s activation policies in Pathways to Work.</p>  <p>  This approach ensured that as many people as possible who are unemployed for over 12 months benefited from the initiative.  The existing 12 months duration on the scheme is deemed to be adequate to meet the scheme's objectives.</p>  <p>  These schemes are kept under constant review to ensure that they remain fit for purpose and continue to meet the needs of the Department's customers.</p></reply>

These supports include Community Employment (CE), the T&uacute;s programme and the Rural Social Scheme (RSS). </p><p>RSS was introduced in 2004 and provides opportunities for farmers and fishermen/women who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments to work to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities.RSS is voluntary and the person applies to participate.</p><p>T&uacute;s commenced operation in 2011 as a response to the high level of unemployment and the large numbers on the Live Register.  It is a community work placement initiative which aims to provide short-term work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract is a maximum of 12 months and this ensures that as many people as possible who are unemployed for over 12 months are able to benefit from the initiative.</p><p>When RSS and T&uacute;s were introduced it was decided that the existing network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta &ndash; referred to as Implementing Bodies (IBs) - were best placed to manage the programmes.  T&uacute;s is managed by 48 IBs, while RSS is managed by 36 IBs.</p><p>My Department assumed responsibility for the Community Employment (CE) programme in 2012.  The aim of the programme, which began in 1994, is to enhance the employability of disadvantaged and unemployed people by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities.  The programme helps break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.</p><p>CE schemes are typically sponsored by voluntary and community organisations wishing to benefit the local community.  As the employers, these sponsoring organisations contract with the Department, on an annual basis, to provide jobseekers and other vulnerable groups with good quality work experience and training qualifications to support their progression into employment.</p><p>Jobseekers receive information about all available employment support options, including Community Employment (CE), through the Intreo Service.  They also receive one-to-one support from a case officer and all available and suitable options are discussed. </p><p>Sponsors can also promote their scheme vacancies within their local communities.  At a local level, various methods of promoting CE have been arranged between my Department and local CE schemes, including targeting potentially eligible jobseekers to attend a CE Job-fair, where details of CE vacancies and employment opportunities are provided. </p><p>In addition CE sponsors can advertise their vacancies free-of-charge on the Department's JobsIreland website,<i>www.jobsireland.ie.</i>The process of posting vacancies is relatively straightforward and a tailored video is available online to assist sponsors.  There are currently over 1,800 CE vacancies advertised on the site.  These are visible to anyone who logs onto the site and users can narrow the search by location. </p><p>It is reasonable to assume that any difficulties in filling CE vacancies can be related to the significant drop in the Live Register over the last year or so arising from the much improved labour market.  Any sponsor who has any recruitment concerns should contact their nearest Intreo Centre who will provide assistance. </p><p>As the economy continues to recover and the overall level of unemployment continues to fall, the Department recognises the need to adapt these work schemes to the changing circumstances, opportunities and needs of jobseekers and others.</p><p>My Department will continue to review these schemes and continue to work with stakeholders in planning the longer term needs of jobseekers and other customers.  It remains committed to ensuring that the social inclusion and community benefits that accrue from these schemes continue to be recognised and supported.</p></reply>

WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  According to Eurostat Data, the parental in-work poverty rate in Ireland is less than half the EU average and this is in large part due to in-work supports such as the WFP and the Back to Work Family Dividend.</p>  <p>  An integral part of the WFP scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment. The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the WFP scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  The average weekly payment across all families is currently in the region of &euro;135 per week.    </p>  <p>  There are currently over 54,000 families with almost 122,000 children in receipt of WFP.  The estimated spend on WFP for 2018 is approximately &euro;431 million, following the increase in the thresholds provided for in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  The focus of the Christmas Bonus has always been on people who rely on the social welfare system for long-term financial support.  Consequently, it is paid to people who are in receipt of a wide range of long-term social welfare payments.  People in receipt of short-term payments do not qualify for the Christmas bonus.  The bonus is paid as a percentage of an individual&rsquo;s weekly entitlement. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the qualifying criteria for the Christmas Bonus would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

The new payment will support parents during the first year of a child's life and allows for more flexibility in managing a work life balance.  The parental benefit scheme will commence in late 2019 and the specific details of the scheme are being examined as part of the legislative drafting process that will be undertaken by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality, which has overall responsibility for parental leave policy. </p>  <p>  The two weeks parental benefit available to both parents will not be shared and cannot be transferred between parents. This recognises that the provision of paid parental leave will be more effective and appropriate in terms of encouraging both fathers and mothers to take time off work to take care of their children.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter at this time.</p></reply>

I launched a public consultation on this proposal earlier this year in May, which closed last month.   The consultation sought input on a range of relevant factors which included the amount of contributions needed for a full rate contributory state pension, the amount of credited contributions a person could avail of, the provision of Homecaring periods and whether there would be a "phase-in period" for the changes.</p>  <p>  Following examination and consideration of the submissions to the consultation, my officials are preparing proposals for the design of the new approach for consideration by the Government in due course.</p>  <p>  In the interim, on 23 January last, this Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement reviewed and calculated on a Total Contributions basis, including provision for up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of writing to the pensioners concerned to let them know how the review will work.  There is no need for pensioners, or anyone on their behalf, to contact my Department about this.  Once the necessary enabling legislation (contained in the Budget Bill) is enacted and the required systems and processes are ready, my Department will again make direct contact with the pensioners concerned about their individual reviews. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that for those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), because they have paid few or no contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For information, in any one week, circa 50,000 customers are entitled to an IB payment. Last week, circa 54,000 customer payments were made, approximately 4,000 payments in excess of the normal level, and this includes some customers due arrears. For any customers with arrears outstanding, the Department would like to assure them that they will receive their back payments as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The Department can confirm that a normal level of payments will issue to IB customers this week. It is, however, important to note that there will always be some people who do not get paid in any given week. This is due to issues such as delays in receipt of claims and certificates, incorrectly completed certificates, human error, inconsistencies between the information submitted and the information already on file, the existence of another welfare payment for the main claimant or their dependants on the claim, all of which can lead to payments being suspended or delayed. This was always the case. </p>  <p>  However, the Department acknowledges that the majority of the delays over the past few weeks were due to system and processing issues rather than normal levels of exceptions and would like to again apologise to the customers affected.</p>  <p>  In August, the IB scheme migrated from an old legacy IT system approaching its end-of-life to a more up-to-date system already successfully used for many of the Department&rsquo;s other payments. As part of this process, IB payments transitioned from a payment in arrears to a real-time payment model. This model was designed to provide quicker access to payments for customers and also to greatly reduce the manual processing work involved in administering IB claims.  Unfortunately, although the majority of customers continued to receive payments, there were a number of unanticipated difficulties and some IB customers&rsquo; payments were adversely affected with delays and missed payments.</p>  <p>  The Department would like to sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration experienced by customers who did not receive the correct IB payment or who experienced delays in their payments. The Department has been working hard over the past few weeks, and is continuing to work, to resolve any outstanding issues - allocating additional staff to IB claim work and developing a number of IT modifications to identify and rectify payment issues. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;182 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  Therefore to receive the fuel allowance a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department and also have satisfied a means test.  A person cannot qualify for the fuel allowance payment on medical grounds alone. </p>  <p>  Qualifying schemes for fuel allowance include disability allowance, invalidity pension, blind pension and incapacity supplement under the disablement pension scheme.  These are schemes for which a recipient must have a long term disability or health issue to qualify for them. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating costs.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance scheme to include people who are not on a qualifying payment would require considerable extra funding for the scheme and would have to be considered in overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 announced a further extension to the scheme and additional funding of &euro;1 m for 2019. The additional funding is to provide a hot school meals pilot programme to commence in the 2019/2020 academic year.</p>  <p>  Research shows us the value of the provision of adequate and nutritious meals for a child&rsquo;s health, learning, attention and educational achievement.  That is why I am providing funds to establish a pilot programme for a hot meals scheme in DEIS schools.  Hot dinners will be provided on a pilot basis in up to some 7,200 children.  If successful, I would hope to work with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) in extending the scheme on a much wider basis in future years and establish the scheme on a permanent basis.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will now engage with officials in DES to identify suitable DEIS schools for the pilot and thereafter a consultation with the schools involved will begin.  The timeframe and duration of the pilot as well as who will evaluate it are to be decided but it is expected that the pilot will commence in September 2019. The pilot will comply with the nutrition standards for school meals.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For information, in any one week, circa 50,000 customers are entitled to an IB payment. Last week, circa 54,000 customer payments were made, approximately 4,000 payments in excess of the normal level, and this includes some customers due arrears. For any customers with arrears outstanding, the Department would like to assure them that they will receive their back payments as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Department can confirm that a normal level of payments will issue to IB customers this week. It is, however, important to note that there will always be some people who do not get paid in any given week. This is due to issues such as delays in receipt of claims and certificates, incorrectly completed certificates, human error, inconsistencies between the information submitted and the information already on file, the existence of another welfare payment for the main claimant or their dependants on the claim, all of which can lead to payments being suspended or delayed. This was always the case.</p>  <p>  However, the Department acknowledges that the majority of the delays over the past few weeks were due to system and processing issues rather than normal levels of exceptions and would like to again apologise to the customers affected.</p>  <p>  In August, the IB scheme migrated from an old legacy IT system approaching its end-of-life to a more up-to-date system already successfully used for many of the Department&rsquo;s other payments. As part of this process, IB payments transitioned from a payment in arrears to a real-time payment model. This model was designed to provide quicker access to payments for customers and also to greatly reduce the manual processing work involved in administering IB claims.  Unfortunately, although the majority of customers continued to receive payments, there were a number of unanticipated difficulties and some IB customers&rsquo; payments were adversely affected with delays and missed payments.</p>  <p>  The Department would like to sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration experienced by customers who did not receive the correct IB payment or who experienced delays in their payments. The Department has been working hard over the past few weeks, and is continuing to work, to resolve any outstanding issues - allocating additional staff to IB claim work and developing a number of IT modifications to identify and rectify payment issues.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The eligibility rules that govern the payment of a student maintenance grant are a matter for that Department.</p>  <p>  Jobseekers Allowance (JA) is a statutory social protection scheme with the legislative provisions provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  These provisions provide for recording the duration of a person's JA claim is terms of days of unemployment. The total number of days of unemployment paid on JA in one continuous period of unemployment is known as the cumulative total.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides that any periods of unemployment not separated by more than 52 weeks for are treated as one such period.  Therefore in cases where a person ceases their jobseeker&rsquo;s payment to take up work but the work ends and the person signs on to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment again within one year, there is no break in the cumulative total days of unemployment.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to change the JA legislation for how days of unemployment are determined and counted. Any proposals to amend the scheme that would give rise to costs within the Department would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy at this time.</p></reply>

In advance of this, on the 23rd January, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by an interim &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.</p>  <p>  People whose pensions were decided under the 2000-2012 rate bands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 52) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.</p>  <p>  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred million euro each year.  This in turn could significantly impact funds for future pension increases with consequential implications for pensioner poverty.</p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;232 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;49.5 million for the scheme in 2018.</p>  <p>  The payment rates for this year are &euro;125 for eligible children aged 4 to 11 years and &euro;250 for children aged over 12 years and attending secondary school.</p>  <p>  Since 2010, in excess of 100,000 customers can be identified every year from the Department's information systems as having an automatic entitlement to the allowance.  These customers are notified of their entitlement and there is no requirement for them to make an application.  In addition, approximately 45,000 customers may have an entitlement but need to apply to have this entitlement assessed.</p>  <p>  Similar to arrangements in previous years, the majority of this year&rsquo;s BSCFA payments for 104,461 families in respect of approximately 190,308 children were fully automated and parents were not required to make an application to the Department.  The total amount paid to families with an automatic entitlement was &euro;33.45m and these payments were made during the week commencing 9th July 2018.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for an automated payment the parent of the child must have been in receipt of a qualifying payment that included an increase in respect of a qualified child at the commencement of the scheme and the Department were satisfied that the household satisfied the means test for the scheme. The scheme for the school year 2018/2019 commenced from the 1st June 2018 with the entitlement created based on the preceding week's entitlement.</p>  <p>  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is a means-tested allowance.  Qualifying for the allowance in a previous year does not in any way guarantee the customer will receive it in a current year and many customers, especially those who had a change in their means or circumstance, needed to make an application for the payment for this year in order to have their entitlement validated.  Customers with children aged 18 years or over also needed to apply and provide confirmation that the children were in full-time second-level education.  Therefore it is not possible to inform customers individually in advance that they may or may not have an entitlement.</p>  <p>  Customers who may have received BSCFA in previous years and did not receive written confirmation of entitlement for this year by end-June needed to make an application.  This has been the case since 2010 and there was no change in the procedure this year.  The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance scheme was open for new applications until 30 September 2018.  The scheme is now closed and no new applications can be considered.</p>  <p>  To date (1 November 2018) 143,829 families have been awarded the allowance in respect of 266,078 children, 11,013 applications have been refused and 385 are awaiting a decision.  Those awaiting a decision are cases where the customer has applied for a social welfare payment and their application for a BSCFA cannot be processed until a decision is made on their main application.  Expenditure to date on the scheme is &euro;47.3m.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting.  They seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  The Second Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 concluded on 4 October 2017.</p>  <p>  In July 2018, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill at Committee Stage including provisions relating to defined benefit schemes.</p>  <p>  A key priority for the Government is to provide additional protections for scheme members&rsquo; pension benefits.  However, it is essential that any new measures recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise.</p>  <p>  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which will, amongst other things, enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit.</p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult with and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In terms of wage-setting generally, however, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through its responsibilities for industrial relations matters, has a role with regard to relations between businesses and employers and their employees, and in relation to wage-setting more particularly through mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements, Joint Labour Committees and Sectoral Employment Orders, in the context of the industrial relations and wage bargaining spheres.  Matters therefore, which do not arise from any unlawful deductions from wages but rather to any knock-on impact on earnings of employees arising from cost-savings measures implemented by employers would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>The Payment of Wages Act 1991 establishes a range of rights for all employees in relation to payment of wages, one of which is protection against unlawful deductions from wages.  However, section 5 of the Act permits an employer to make the following deductions (or receive the following payments) from the wages of an employee:</p><p>(a) any deduction (or payment) required or authorised in legislation;</p><p>(b) any deduction or payment required or authorised by a term of the employee&rsquo;s contract; and</p><p>(c) any deduction agreed to in writing in advance by the employee.</p><p>Any change to an employment contract must be agreed between the employer and the employee.  The requirement for both the employer's and the employee's consent to changes in the terms of the contract is part of contract law.  It is also important to note that the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 would continue to apply even in a situation where a negotiated reduction might be agreed between the parties.</p><p>The Payment of Wages Act provides that, where an employee considers that there may have been a contravention of the Act, the employee may submit a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) within 6 months of the date of the alleged contravention.  The Workplace Relations Customer Service Section of the WRC provides information on employees&rsquo; rights and how to obtain redress if an employee considers that their employment rights may have been infringed.  They can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or via its website <i>www.workplacerelations.ie</i>.  The Single Complaint Form for submitting complaints regarding breaches of employment rights is also available at <i>www.workplacerelations.ie</i>.  An explanatory booklet on the Payment of Wages Act is also available on that website.</p></reply>

Where a person has transport difficulties, the JobPath provider will assist the person with travel options including tailoring the service around their particular travel arrangements if necessary.</p>  <p>  Both companies contracted to provide the JobPath service on behalf of my Department, Seetec and Turas Nua, have their own discretionary funds available to provide jobseekers engaged with their service with a range of supports based on an assessment of individual needs.  This includes reasonable travel costs for the purposes of attending meetings with their personal advisor or attending interviews or other meetings associated with potential job opportunities.  An immediate reimbursement is given on production of a ticket or other evidence of travel.  On a case by case basis, the JobPath providers may also pay for items such as personal protective equipment, tools, work clothing, Private Security Authority (PSA) licences and may also arrange and pay for specific skills training if required by a jobseeker for a particular job opportunity.</p>  <p>  The JobPath providers may also use their own funds on a discretionary basis to support JobPath participants in the early stages of employment if appropriate.</p>  <p>  The JobPath providers engage with employers and employers' bodies in all areas of the country and across a range of employment sectors to establish vacancies and to understand the needs of employers in assisting job seekers to return to the workforce.</p>  <p>  The current Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold.  First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work to ensure that as many of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register.</p>  <p>  I recently introduced a new work experience programme targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment.  The new Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) will provide young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement and at the same time improving their employment prospects.  Participation on the scheme will be wholly voluntary and participants will receive an allowance of &euro;229.20 per week for the duration of their placement.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market:</p>  <p>  - the monthly unemployment rate has dropped consistently over the past year and has now fallen to 5.3%, as of October 2018. This means that there are now about 29,000 fewer people out of work in Ireland compared to October 2017;</p>  <p>  - Youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 12% in October 2018 estimated by CSO, down from a peak rate of almost 32% in 2012.  The youth unemployment rate now lies significantly below the EU-28 average rate of 15.8%;</p>  <p>  - Latest available data shows that the long-term unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 9.5% in 2012 to 2.0% in Q2 2018.  The actual number of people out of work for a year or more has fallen by more than three-quarters, from 215,000 in early 2012 to just under 50,000 now. Long-term unemployment can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment.  Already, we have exceeded our target to bring long-term unemployment below 2.5% in accordance with Pathways to Work targets for 2020.</p>  <p>  The current policy approach, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in unemployment and add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy be aware of a specific case of any jobseeker engaged with the JobPath service who due to their home address find themselves unable to travel to a potential employment opportunity or have difficulty in attending JobPath sessions, I would invite the Deputy to contact my Department in relation to this case and officials in my Department will examine the case.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They are not employees of my Department nor are they public servants, and as such they were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI), which only applied to public servants.</p>  <p>  The supervisor pension scheme issue is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector.  However, the Deputy should note that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p></reply>

In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, legislation passed in 2011 provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date which is now before pensionable age, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  </p>  <p>  In such circumstances, a person who has not yet attained pensionable age will generally pay PRSI in the normal way, as they would have when they were younger, and those paid contributions may be reckonable for State pension (contributory), if they would have been reckonable before reaching the age of 65.  In some cases, they might not have been reckonable contributions, e.g. the modified contributions paid by some public servants are not reckonable for State pension (contributory) purposes.  However, such employees generally have an occupational pension, the level of which is related to a number of factors, including years of service.</p>  <p>  Where it is not possible to continue work, a person who has not yet reached pensionable age may be eligible for a working age payment, such as Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance, and may be awarded credited contributions, in the same way a person aged under 65 might be.  Whether that contribution is reckonable for State pension (contributory) purposes would depend upon their circumstances, notably the nature of their previous employment and the rate of PRSI contributions for which they had been liable.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme aims to assist those who are most marginalised and distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system. </p>  <p>  The Department's Case Officer, having engaged with the individual, will consider their suitability for a course of study and the alignment with their personal progression plan to facilitate a return to employment.  The Case Officer provides direction insofar as this relates to ensuring that the course of study is in an area where there are identified skill needs and job opportunities.  The Deputy should be aware that Case Officers receive on-going training which is an important part of their development to ensure that they can engage with the jobseeker in a fair manner to enable them to pursue their job seeking ambitions.  </p>  <p>  If a person is dissatisfied with the decision taken regarding BTEA it is open to them to seek a review by another officer within the Department. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a particular case, she should bring it to my Department's attention for review.  </p></reply>

I launched a public consultation on this proposal earlier this year in May, which closed last month.  The consultation sought input on a range of relevant factors which included the amount of contributions needed for a full rate contributory state pension, the amount of credited contributions a person could avail of, the provision of Homecaring periods and whether there would be a "phase-in period" for the changes.</p>  <p>  Following examination and consideration of the submissions to the consultation, my officials will prepare proposals for the design of the new approach for consideration by the Government in due course.</p>  <p>  In the interim, on 23 January last, this Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated/reviewed on a Total Contributions basis, including provision for up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of writing to the pensioners concerned to let them know how the review will work.  There is no need for pensioners, or anyone on their behalf, to contact my Department about this.  Once the necessary enabling legislation (contained in the Budget Bill) is enacted and the required systems and processes are ready, my Department will again make direct contact with the pensioners concerned about their individual reviews. </p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to remove the minimum requirement to have 520 contributions paid to qualify for the contributory state pension.  It is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years' paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it, over 50 years of working age life.  While it was lower in the past when PRSI coverage was less widespread, legislation was introduced in 1997 to increase this threshold to 520 weeks, or 10 years of contributions.  A fifteen year period was allowed pass between that legislation being enacted and the threshold being raised to this level, which would have been sufficient for most people to achieve the required contributions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that for those who do not qualify for the State Pension (contributory) (SPC), because they have paid few or no contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, there are other state pension payments available.  Notably, they may qualify for the State Pension (non-contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of 95% of the SPC.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate SPC pension.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

For information, in any one week, circa 50,000 customers are entitled to an IB payment.  Last week, circa 54,000 customer payments were made, approximately 4,000 payments in excess of the normal level, and this includes some customers due arrears.  For any customers with arrears outstanding, the Department would like to assure them that they will receive their back payments as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  The Department can confirm that a normal level of payments will issue to IB customers this week.  It is, however, important to note that there will always be some people who do not get paid in any given week.  This is due to issues such as delays in receipt of claims and certificates, incorrectly completed certificates, human error, inconsistencies between the information submitted and the information already on file, the existence of another welfare payment for the main claimant or their dependants on the claim - can all lead to payments being suspended or delayed.  This was always the case. </p>  <p>  However, the Department acknowledges that the majority of the delays over the past few weeks were due to system and processing issues rather than normal levels of exceptions and would like to again apologise to the customers affected.</p>  <p>  In August, the IB scheme migrated from an old legacy IT system approaching its end-of-life to a more up-to-date system, already successfully used for many of the Department&rsquo;s other payments.  As part of this process, IB payments transitioned from a payment in arrears to a real-time payment model.  This model was designed to provide quicker access to payments for customers and also to greatly reduce the manual processing work involved in administering IB claims.  Unfortunately, although the majority of customers continued to receive payments, there were a number of unanticipated difficulties and some IB customers&rsquo; payments were adversely affected with delays and missed payments.</p>  <p>  The Department would like to sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration experienced by customers who did not receive the correct IB payment or who experienced delays in their payments.  The Department has been working hard over the past few weeks, and is continuing to work, to resolve any outstanding issues - allocating additional staff to IB claim work and developing a number of IT modifications to identify and rectify payment issues. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme provides financial incentives to private sector employers to hire people with a disability for between 21 and 39 hours per week under a contract of employment. </p>  <p>  The objective of the wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is to increase the likelihood of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market by making available a subsidy to private sector employers.  The scheme operates by allowing employers to claim a subsidy, subject to certain conditions, against the cost of a &lsquo;shortfall&rsquo; in productivity which may arise were a jobseeker (who has a disability) is employed.  </p>  <p>  Depending on the number of persons with a disability employed, the WSS may provide additional payments to be made to employers to cover additional supervisory or management costs and/or the cost of employing an employment assistance officer to support the particular staff within the company.</p>  <p>  The scheme operates under guidelines issued by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The guidelines cover the need to be tax compliant in line with the normal for publicly funded schemes.  This forms one of a number of requirements under which the scheme operates which includes conditionalities, verifications, monitoring visits and departmental review.  Neither an employer or employee can commence on the WSS without Tax Clearance.   </p>  <p>  The issue of securing tax compliance is a matter for the employer and the Revenue Commissioners.  Following the certification of tax compliance, the employer might then contact the Department in relation to a claim for WSS in line with the relevant guidelines.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.3030.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600105#WRXX01900"><p>Section 18 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014 allows for the discrimination on the grounds of age in respect of a prescribed class of persons in the provision of employment services and supports. The provisions in Section 18 facilitate the implementation of the Youth Guarantee, which was agreed by the European Council on 22 April 2013 to tackle the challenge of youth joblessness.</p><p>When the EU Youth Guarantee Recommendation was adopted in 2013, Ireland already had in place many of the elements to meet the recommendation&rsquo;s objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed.  The implementation of the Irish Youth Guarantee focused on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to secure sustainable jobs.</p><p>JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In February 2015 &ldquo;JobsPlus Youth&rdquo; was added to the scheme under the EU Youth Guarantee scheme.  This addition was in line with recommendations from the OECD and meant that, the qualifying period for those aged under 25 was reduced from 12 months to four months. A focus Policy Assessment on JobsPlus was undertaken in 2017 and published in 2018 which reviewed the operation of the JobsPlus employment incentive scheme from the commencement of the scheme in July 2013 up until the end of 2016.  Between 2014 and 2016 a total of 2,167 participants aged under 25 benefitted from JobsPlus.  Between June 2013 and December 2016, the Live Register fell by 36% from 434,905 to 276,502 while at the same time unemployment among under 25s had also fallen by 57% from 71,202 to 30,285.  This indicated that, in 2017 with an improving economy, deadweight on the scheme for under 25s may be increasing as more of this cohort would find work without the assistance of JobsPlus.</p><p>The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) which was launched this year is also targeted at young jobseekers that face difficulty in entering the labour market or some form of work experience.  A review will be undertaken on this initiative in due course.</p><p>For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as CE and T&uacute;s.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under-25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to the long-term unemployed. </p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs sets out Ireland&rsquo;s policies in support of enterprise and employment growth.  The most recent <i>Pathways to Work </i>strategy, for the period 2016-2020, continues to focus on addressing youth unemployment, building on reforms introduced in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan and by introducing new measures to ensure that the young unemployed take up a substantial share of the jobs being created by economic recovery.  </p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 12% estimated by CSO in October 2018, down from a peak rate of almost 32% in 2012.  The youth unemployment rate now lies significantly below the EU-28 average rate of 15.8%.Youth unemployment figures can be expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecast fall in overall unemployment. </p><p>These trends indicate that together with improvements in the labour market and economic recovery, our approach to youth employment, which focuses in the first instance on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to find and secure sustainable jobs, has been relatively successful.</p><p>The Pathways to Work Strategy commits to a rolling programme of process and programme evaluations of Pathways to Work reforms. Programme evaluations conducted to date can be accessed at:</p><p><i>www.welfare.ie/Pathways-to-work-research</i>.</p><p>Each report outlines the probability of exit to employment at various stages post-programme completion.  Furthermore, evaluations of JobPath and JobsPlus, including JobsPlus Youth, are currently underway and are expected to be finalised later this year. As with all schemes, my Department will continue to review the conditions and operations of the schemes to ensure they remain effective.</p></reply>

It is the first comprehensive upgrade of Ireland&rsquo;s water infrastructure in over 60 years. </p><p>An additional 330 million litres of treated water a day is estimated to be needed in the Greater Dublin and Eastern and Midlands Region by 2050. In 2015, Irish Water embarked on an extensive public consultation process to identify a new source of water supply for the region.  Overall, ten options were assessed on technical environmental and economic grounds. The abstraction of raw water from the Parteen Basin and the Lower River Shannon was ultimately identified as Irish Water&rsquo;s preferred option.</p><p>The Water Services Act 2013 requires the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to provide consent for all commitments for capital expenditure above a certain threshold.</p><p>Given the scale and importance of the Eastern and Midlands Water Supply Project, and recognising the CRU&rsquo;s statutory role as independent economic regulator of Irish Water, including its role of reviewing Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plans, I have requested the CRU to undertake the review to support my decision as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in relation to the capital consent that will be required in the event that planning approval is obtained for the project. The request to the CRU is consistent with the CRU&rsquo;s role under Section 40 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to advise the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on the development and delivery of water services.</p><p>The Terms of Reference for the Review are available on the CRU website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p></reply>

However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects, provides more stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility. Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their life cycles.  Large-scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector that tenants deserve.</p>  <p>  The fact that institutional investors are entering the rental market, with a clear long-term focus on their investment provides security for tenants who can be confident that their landlord is committed for the long run.  </p>  <p>  A number of additional tenancy protection measures were introduced in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 to enhance tenants&rsquo; security, including:</p>  <p>  - The abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to end that tenancy for no stated ground;</p>  <p>  - The extension of the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years; and</p>  <p>  - Protection for existing tenants to remain in situ where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  These provisions apply to the apartments in question.</p></reply>

Firstly, there was a reduction in Board capacity in mid-2017, arising from a time interval between the departure of five outgoing Board members, whose terms of office had expired in April and May, and the five new replacement Board members taking up their posts.  While, by September 2017, the Board complement had been fully replenished, this time interval significantly impacted on the Board&rsquo;s capacity and case work output over the whole year.</p>  <p>  In addition, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also implementing a major ICT strategy which will facilitate the introduction of on-line planning services as part of a complete upgrade and replacement of core systems.  In this regard, a new case management system was installed and became operational in Q4 2017.  As is to be expected with such a fundamental and integrated project, the transition to the new system has caused some initial disruption to the processing of cases, resulting in a further increase in the backlog of cases on hand. However, measures have been put in place to ensure that the new system is bedded down and becomes operational at an optimal level as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there has been a general increase in cases received by the Board.  For example, there was an increase of almost 12% on normal planning appeals received in 2017 compared to 2016; this upward trend has continued into 2018. The intake of normal planning appeals in the nine months to end-September 2018 was 10% greater than the intake over the corresponding period to end-September 2017.</p>  <p>  Now that the Board's full complement has been restored, combined with the measures that are being put in place in relation to the new ICT systems, it is expected that the backlog of cases will begin to reduce over the coming months, with an associated improvement in the compliance rate with the statutory objective period for the determination of cases.</p>  <p>  My Department liaises closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources in relation to the performance of its functions.  In mid-2017, the Board was assigned additional functions in determining planning applications for strategic housing developments.  A new Strategic Housing Division of the Board was established to decide on these applications, involving the recruitment of an additional dedicated 10 professional and administrative staff members in 2017.  Two additional Board members have also been sanctioned to serve this Division, with the appointments being made in February and June this year.  </p>  <p>  The Board now has a complement of 11 members and has over 150 staff employed.  I am satisfied that the Board has sufficient and necessary resources to deliver effectively and efficiently on its important statutory mandate and functions.</p></reply>

The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p>  <p>  The Exchequer contribution is &euro;275 million with &euro;35 million to be contributed by local authorities. In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund, with a further &euro;142 million in 2020, and &euro;68 million in 2021.</p>  <p>  A first call for proposals under the Fund issued to eleven local authorities, where the greatest affordability issues exist: the four Dublin local authorities; Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth and Cork County Councils and Cork and Galway City Councils.  Fifteen proposals were received from nine of the eleven local authorities targeted under this first call.</p>  <p>  The proposals are currently being assessed and I expect to make an announcement of the first successful bids shortly, together with details of the number of affordable homes to be supported. While South Dublin and Louth County Councils did not make applications under the first call, further calls for proposals will be made, with a second call to be initiated shortly, and it will be open to the Councils to submit applications at that stage, if they consider it appropriate.</p>  <p>  Once the funding is awarded and the infrastructure is provided, I expect delivery of affordable homes from 2019 onwards. Separately, all local authorities are now carrying out an economic assessment of the requirement for affordable housing in their area, and the authorities&rsquo; capacity to deliver housing at affordable prices from their sites.</p>  <p>  Based on this analysis further local authorities may be considered for funding under the SSF.</p></reply>

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important objective of the Government and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard.  </p><p>My Department has introduced the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme in order to target newly built or yet to be built houses and apartments for long term leasing, and to target property developers and investors who are in a position to deliver housing at a reasonable scale in order to supplement delivery under Pillar 2 of Rebuilding Ireland.  </p><p>A key aspect of the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme is that the proposer will finance 100% of the cost of delivering the homes.  All arrangements for the funding and financing of such proposals are a matter for the individual proposers, who will bear all financial risks in this respect.  </p><p>An Agreement for Lease will only be signed where the Housing Agency and the relevant local authority are satisfied that the proposal meets the fundamental criteria set out in the Call for Proposals documentation (which is available at <i></i>).</p><p>Committed funding is a condition for entry into a lease agreement with a local authority. Proposers are required to provide a brief summary of their strategy to source committed funding to meet their development and lease obligations to include, without limitation, delivery of homes and delivery of the services under the lease.  The Housing Agency, which has responsibility for overseeing and managing the assessment process, assesses this information in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) in order to ensure that the proposer has the capability to deliver both the units themselves and their obligations under the lease. This assessment is carried out in advance of any acceptance into the scheme and the signing of any agreements. </p><p>As it is targeted at newly built or yet to be built properties, the Enhanced Leasing Scheme includes the provision for an Agreement for Lease document to be signed in advance of the commencement of construction.  The Agreement for Lease places an obligation on the property owner to meet specific conditions in respect of the property before any lease is executed, thereby guaranteeing the delivery of the units as agreed by an agreed date.  </p><p>The Housing Agency also operates a &ldquo;Pre-Planning Suitability Assessment&rdquo; process in order to provide information to relevant parties as to the suitability of their site and proposed development for inclusion in the Scheme, in advance of obtaining planning permission.  </p><p>The Pre-Planning Suitability Assessment process is designed to allow prospective applicants the opportunity to establish if a proposed development may be considered potentially suitable for inclusion in the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme. The Housing Agency will engage with the relevant local authority in respect of a particular site or sites and will inform the proposer if it would be likely that a proposal would pass or fail an assessment under the terms of the scheme if it were put forward formally with the benefit of planning permission. </p><p>This process has no material bearing on any other statutory process (e.g. the Planning process) and it is explicit in the terms of the scheme set out in the Call for Proposals document that an indication of the suitability of the proposed development through this process should not be considered as confirmation of its acceptance or otherwise to the scheme. Submissions are only accepted on lands with the relevant in-principle planning policy support and all proposals will be required to be re-assessed in full, including confirmation of funding arrangements, once planning permission has been obtained, in line with the terms of the Scheme.  Consequently, any financial decisions made on the part of the proposer on foot of an assessment at this stage are made entirely at their own risk.</p></reply>

The latest report is based on the assessment of effluent monitoring results from 1,100 waste water treatment plants reported to the EPA by Irish Water and on enforcement activities carried out by the EPA during 2017.</p><p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level, including investment in wastewater treatment plants, and  Irish Water&rsquo;s primary function is to provide clean safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment.  Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements.</p><p>Following actions taken by Irish Water, the EPA has found that the number of priority urban areas where waste water treatment needs to improve is down to 132 from 148 in 2016.  Of 44 towns and villages where raw sewage was being discharged in 2016, 6 are now connected to treatment plants. The remaining 38 towns and villages, with a population equivalent of 88,000 people, will be connected by 2021.  </p><p>Out of the 179 Large Urban Areas in Ireland, 28 areas failed to comply with the EU&rsquo;s legally binding standards for the treatment of urban waste water.  Over the period 2016&ndash;2024, capital upgrades and operational improvement works will have been completed or undertaken at all of these urban waste-water treatment plants to ensure that treatment levels and capacity comply with the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.Substantial State funding is being provided for this purpose under the National Development Plan under Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>This investment reflects the objectives of the River Basin Management Plan 2018 - 2021 which outlines what Ireland is doing to protect and improve our waters.  Among a broad suite of measures the plan provides for &euro;1.7 billion worth of investment by Irish Water in 255 urban wastewater projects which are designed to achieve compliance with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD). Of the urban areas where works are required, the majority will be compliant by end 2021, including Ringsend which is the single largest wastewater treatment plant in the country, accounting for 41% of the total wastewater load.</p><p>The European Commission has taken an infringement case against Ireland in relation to the UWWTD which sets out requirements for the collection, treatment and discharge of urban waste water.  A hearing in the case took place in the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on 19 September 2018 and a judgement is due within 6 months. </p><p><b></b>Irish Water has developed a long term investment perspective in order to strategically address the deficiencies in the public water and wastewater system.  It is optimising investment decisions to ensure that they utilise scarce capital by making investments that deliver the best possible improvements for these communities.  Building water and wastewater treatment plants and upgrading or building water and wastewater networks as necessary will require significant investment.</p></reply>

A commitment to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes through a range of delivery mechanisms is being supported by a multi-annual Exchequer commitment totalling &euro;6.5 billion over the period of the plan. These targets will be achieved using a combination of building, purchasing and leasing high quality properties to meet the needs of households on local authority waiting lists around the country. </p><p>Of the 50,000 social homes to be delivered under RI, 10,000 are targeted to be delivered under Leasing. These homes will be delivered by AHBs and housing authorities from a range of different sources and funded under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).</p><p>Data on social housing leasing output is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i></i>.  Data in respect of Q3 2018 is currently being collated and will be available shortly.</p><p>Housing authorities have delegated authority from my Department to enter into leasing arrangements for up to four dwellings, within a single development or with a single owner, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions governing the leasing scheme. In all other circumstances, local authorities must seek Departmental approval to lease dwellings. All leasing proposals by AHBs must be submitted to my Department for approval, regardless of the number of dwellings being leased. The current position is that a total of 674 new social housing homes are currently approved by my Department for delivery by local authorities. </p><p>The first call for proposals for the Enhanced Leasing Scheme was open from January to April 2018. A total of 33 submissions were received and currently 3 proposals are in the final stages of due diligence.  Information with respect to the number and location of the dwellings proposed for leasing under the Scheme will be available once the respective housing authorities have signed Agreements for Lease arising from the completion of the due diligence process. The second call for proposals closed on 25th October 2018 and the Housing Agency is currently validating all submissions made under that call, including Pre-Planning Suitability Assessment submissions. </p><p>My Department and the Housing Agency continue to work with local authorities and proposers in respect of the Enhanced Leasing Scheme, and the leasing schemes generally, in order to ensure maximum delivery of high quality leased properties to meet the needs of households on social housing waiting lists.</p></reply>

The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders. The draft standard was published on 6 June 2018 for public consultation and ran for a period of six weeks to 18 July 2018. The Technical Committee have finalised the review of the submissions received and it is expected that the standardised protocol will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>The draft standard, I.S. 465 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials, outlines a protocol which will be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite. Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks to help decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.</p><p>This standard:</p><p>1. establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite);</p><p>2. describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem; </p><p>3. describes the scope of any testing required; and</p><p>4. categorises buildings, in accordance with this Standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference.  Engineers Ireland has provided assurance that they will collaborate with the Department, the NSAI and others on measures to establish such a register once the standardised protocol is in place.</p><p>Last year, I visited Donegal and Mayo and met with key stakeholders, including affected homeowners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties. On 18 December 2017, I again visited Donegal and met with key stakeholders to provide an update on the progress to date.  I made a similar visit to Mayo on 26 January 2018 and again to Donegal on 13 July 2018. </p><p>I will be in a position to provide a further update following the publication of the standardised protocol in the coming weeks.</p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.</p><p>The putting in place of such a scheme is now a key priority for my Department and work is well underway on the development of such a scheme, with a view to its completion as soon as possible, details of which, including funding, will be published once finalised. </p></reply>

If a landlord is terminating the tenancy on the grounds that he or she intends to substantially refurbish or renovate the dwelling in a way that requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose, the notice of termination must include a statement:</p><p>(a)  specifying the nature of the intended works and providing a copy of any related planning permission.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and associated services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities. </p>  <p>   My Department does not have the specific data sought in relation to the time spent in emergency accommodation.  The performance reports submitted by the regional lead local authorities provide information on the period spent in emergency accommodation.  The most recent reports available are for Quarter 2 2018, which show that at the end of Quarter 2 2018, 48% of adults recorded as being in emergency accommodation at that time, were resident in emergency accommodation for less than 6 months and 52% were resident for more than 6 months.</p>  <p>  In relation to family hubs, there are currently 23 family hubs in operation, 19 of which are in Dublin, one in each of Cork, Limerick, Kildare and Louth.  These hubs provide 550 units of family accommodation.  The operators of the family hubs work with families to support their exit from emergency accommodation into an independent tenancy within a six-month period.  My Department does not have a breakdown on the numbers of families who have been accommodated in family hubs or who have left family hubs.  My Department's monthly homelessness report includes details of the numbers of individuals and families in emergency accommodation each month. My Department also publishes data on the number of adults who exited homelessness into an independent tenancy, which is provided by the local authorities in their quarterly performance reports. In 2017, 4,729 adults, along with their associated dependents, exited homelessness into an independent tenancy. A further 2,332 adults and their associated dependents exited homelessness in the first six months of 2018.  My Department is currently reviewing the format and content of both the monthly and quarterly homelessness reports.</p></reply>

Discussions concluded in December 2017, when I approved increased subsidy levels. The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018. Local authorities were advised by my Department of the increased subsidy levels on 19 December 2017 and detailed terms and conditions for the subsidy were subsequently issued by my Department to local authorities.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions allow for group water schemes to apply an excessive use charge on their domestic members where they are consuming above a household threshold (160 cubic meters/day) as well as a formal mechanism for schemes to reduce this household threshold amount (provided that it is not reduced to less than 115 cubic meters/day) if they are to avail of the subsidy. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions allows schemes to recoup some costs at 100% and others at 85%. If a scheme can demonstrate a higher domestic membership/usage, it may be entitled to a higher rate.   </p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there should be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services.</p>  <p>  Additionally the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme provides capital funding opportunities for Group Water Schemes to, if suitably located, interconnect to and be taken in charge by Irish Water (Measure 4 of the multi-annual programme), or amalgamate with nearby Group Water Schemes forming a new larger entity that is more effective, including in their day-to-day running costs, through economies of scale (Measure 1 of the multi-annual programme).</p>  <p>  Measure 3 of the multi-annual programme provides capital funding for schemes to undertake water conservation works to reduce their wastage of water, through carrying out, where necessary, replacement of defective water mains, thus enabling schemes to reduce their day-to-day running costs.</p>  <p>  Separate to the initial review of Group Water Scheme subsidy levels and also in fulfilment of the JOCFFDWS recommendations, in April 2018, I established a Working Group to conduct a wider review of investment needs and rural water services. There is a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 is considering the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme from 2019 up to 2021, while Strand 2 will consider the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the Rural Water Sector.</p></reply>

This provision enables local authority fire services to provide a response to a range of emergency situations other than fires. Over the years, fire authorities have expanded the range of emergencies to which their fire services respond to include road traffic accidents, hazardous material incidents, rescues from confined spaces and heights, water rescue etc. Fire services also attend emergency incidents at the request of other emergency services and collaborate with them in assisting the public. The provisions of section 25 of the Act enable fire authorities to undertake these roles and to assist in any operations of an emergency nature. However, it does not impose a statutory responsibility on fire authorities to perform any of these functions, nor does it confer a role on me as Minister in relation to these functions. </p>  <p>  As Minister with accountability for fire safety and the provision of fire services by local authorities, I am primarily concerned that local authority fire service resources are used to meet their statutory obligations in respect of provision of fire services and fire safety responsibilities. My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters, providing a central training programme and providing a capital funding programme for priority infrastructure projects to support local authority expenditure. </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council provides fire and emergency services for the city and county of Dublin on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, which are also fire authorities. The local authority fire services in Dublin also provide a valued emergency ambulance service in some parts of the greater Dublin area, an arrangement carried over from the time when the local authority was also the health authority. The enabling provision contained in section 25 of the Act referred to above provides a legislative basis for local authority fire service involvement in this activity. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the provision of emergency medical services, including pre-hospital emergency care, is the responsibility of the HSE which operates the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and emergency departments in hospitals in accordance with health sector legislation and national health policy. Therefore, while operating under fire services legislation, Dublin City Council&rsquo;s fire services are in effect acting as an agent for the HSE and the costs associated with this ambulance service provision are recouped from the HSE. Dublin City Council is not providing a substitute or alternative/parallel ambulance service, operating outside of the State&rsquo;s health services provided by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the existing arrangements are a matter for Dublin City Council and the HSE in the first instance. I have no role in relation to legislation, policy, mobilisation arrangements, operational practices, medical oversight or funding of ambulance services.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-06a.3167.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018110600107#WRZZ02500"><p>I assume the question refers to the Local Government (Funding) Baseline review, which has taken place largely in parallel with the review of Local Property Tax (LPT), led by the Department of Finance. Since the introduction of local retention of LPT in 2015, LPT allocations have replaced General Purpose Grants funding previously received by local authorities  from the Local Government Fund. </p><p>The Local Government (Funding) Baseline review group was  established earlier this year and comprised representatives from my Department,  the City and County Management Association (CCMA) and the Association of Irish Local Government (AILG).  The terms of reference of the group were: </p><p>- To consider the broad range of general indicators and data sources, not linked to specific programmes, that could be applied across the local government sector to review baselines and guide the allocation of non-programme funding;</p><p>- To consider the rationale behind these indicators and whether appropriate to the local government sector;</p><p>- To recommend a set of indicators and associated data sources to inform the objective set out in bullet 1;</p><p>- To recommend a weighting that may attach to each indicator;</p><p>- To consider, insofar as possible, the existing sources of, and demands on, local authority non-programme income as part of this process;</p><p>- To consult widely with relevant stakeholders;</p><p>- To conclude this programme of work before end August 2018.</p><p>The findings and recommendations of the Review Group are currently under consideration in my Department.</p><p>As is the case with all other local authorities, Galway County Council were notified in July this year of their provisional 2019 LPT allocation amounting to  &euro;14.5m, notwithstanding any subsequent local variation decision.  One of the aims of LPT was to enhance the financial autonomy of local authorities so as to bring about a greater connection between local expenditure and local revenue raising, thereby reducing reliance on central funding.  In this context, it is important to note that local authorities have the power to vary LPT rates locally by up to 15% and in such circumstances would retain all of the additional LPT generated from that decision. Any such local  LPT variation decisions  are a matter for the elected members of the authority to consider  in the context of the revenue raising tools available locally. Galway County Council decided not to vary the LPT rate for 2019. Accordingly, the 2019 LPT allocation will remain unchanged  at &euro;14.5m. </p><p>Central Government funding of local government is a complex matter, with transfers coming from a wide range of Departments and Offices, not solely from my Department, for a variety of purposes. Some streams of funding are delivered directly from funding departments to local authorities, while others are routed through departmental agencies. Some elements of funding are project-specific, giving rise to changes in funding from one year to another, depending on a project's progression. The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG) reports on the Central Government funding of local authorities as part of his Annual Report, which provides an overview of the funds flowing from and through central government sources to local authorities and the purposes for which funds have been provided. The most recent report can be viewed at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>In terms of funding for Galway County Council, across all schemes and funding sources, my Department has provided &euro;31.6m in 2015, &euro;33.5m in 2016, &euro;33.7m in 2017 and &euro;33.8m up to the end of October 2018. Notwithstanding this, I am cognisant of the financial pressures facing Galway County Council; my Department is currently in discussions with the local authority in this regard and I expect that these discussions will conclude shortly.</p></reply>

This means that there is no designated competent authority, which has the power to approve or restrict access to the profession in Ireland under national or EU law. </p>  <p>  In early 2016, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) published Awards Standards for Architectural Technology award. The Awards Standards are designed to be used by: </p>  <p>  (i) providers when designing new programmes and establishing minimum intended programme learning outcomes; </p>  <p>  (ii) awarding bodies when validating new programmes;  and</p>  <p>  (iii) in the accreditation of programmes by the relevant professional bodies. They are also used by providers when reviewing their programmes.</p>  <p>  In general, the regulation of professions is in the first instance a matter for industry representatives working in consultation with relevant industry stakeholders.  My Department has been engaging with the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) in relation to the establishment of a statutory register. In this regard, CIAT has identified that its preferred route is to set up a stand alone register for Architectural Technologists. As such, it is now a matter for CIAT to set up a register on an administrative basis in keeping with registers already in place for other professional groupings under the Building Control Act 2007 and in consultation with the relevant industry stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  When this process is complete, my Department will be in a position to review it and potentially bring forward legislative proposals to amend the Building Control Act 2007, to provide for a statutory register of Architectural Technologists. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that, depending on their personal background and experience, it may be open to persons who are Architectural Technologists, and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers in respect of Architects or Building Surveyors. A number of Architectural Technologists have already succeeded in gaining inclusion on the statutory registers to date and are thus in a position to act as Design Certifiers and Assigned Certifiers.</p></reply>

An annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out, on a short-term basis &ndash; i.e. for 14 days or less at a time, of a person&rsquo;s entire home where it is their primary residence.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it as a Short Term Letting (STL), they will require planning permission to do so unless the property is already permitted to be used for tourism / short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to STL can be sought and it will be up to each local Planning Authority to consider applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners to prepare for and adapt to the new laws. In addition to revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which have been prepared, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals; drafting of these amendments is currently underway.</p>  <p>  Any unauthorised development, including breaches of the proposed exemptions, may be the subject of planning enforcement by the relevant planning authority.</p></reply>

Reversing such a significant decline in residential activity to a more balanced supply and demand position requires a mix of  targeted actions across the complex and inter-related parts of the housing system.</p><p><i>Rebuilding Ireland,</i>the Government's comprehensive action plan on housing and homelessness, provides a robust framework in this regard, involving a series of significant responses that are designed to:</p><p>- Address homelessness;</p><p>- Develop a major social housing programme; </p><p>- Accelerate and increase housing delivery; </p><p>- Reform and modernise the rental sector; and</p><p>- Maximise the potential from vacant homes.</p><p>Ongoing support is being provided for our most vulnerable people, while long-term programmes are being implemented to create a sustainable pathway to a stable and consistent housing system. The Government's commitment in this regard is clear, evidenced by the nearly 26,000 social housing supports delivered in 2017, the significant increase in funding being provided in 2018 and the further substantial increase in funding under Budget 2019 for housing next year, when &euro;2.4 billion will be invested, more than in any previous year.</p><p>A strong and growing social housing construction pipeline is now in place, as evidenced in the Quarter 2 2018 Construction Status Report. Since the end of 2016, the number of schemes and homes in the programme has doubled. Activity on-site has also increased significantly, with 1,074 homes going on-site in Q2 this year alone. The Q2 2018 Report is available at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Housing Supply more generally is also increasing significantly . The CSO reports that nearly 19,700 new homes became available for use in the 12 months to end Q2 2018, an increase of 24% year on year. Planning permissions and site commencements are also increasing significantly. The latest housing activity data is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>In relation to affordable housing, a multi-stranded, targeted approach is being pursued in the areas of the country most affected by a lack of affordable housing supply.  The measures are targeted at households earning a maximum of &euro;50,000 for a single applicant or &euro;75,000 for a couple.  Specifically, under Budget 2019, the Government has trebled, to &euro;310 million, the funding available for key facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).</p><p>Land is a critical residential construction input.  A key initiative in this regard is the establishment of the new Land Development Agency, which will take a more strategic approach to the management and development of the publicly owned residential land bank, acting within a clear government policy framework, including that all public land disposals must deliver at least 40% social (10%) and affordable (30%) housing.  <b></b></p><p>Increasing housing supply generally, and social and more affordable housing in particular, is, and will remain, a top Government priority.</p></reply>

Under article 6.3 of the Directive consent could only be given to cut turf on a raised bog special area of conservation where it can be shown by rigorous scientific investigations that such cutting will not have an adverse effect on the (ecological) integrity of the site.</p>  <p>  If it can be demonstrated that turf cutting within a proposed location in a special area of conservation would not impact on the integrity of a European site, the appropriate consent would then be required from the relevant public authority.</p>  <p>  As set out in the National Plan, the site referred to in the Deputy's Question is one of the sites being examined as regards the potential for domestic turf cutting on the site in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. The initial phase of scientific investigations on the site, undertaken by contractors engaged by my Department, was completed in November 2017. These investigations illustrated that a further specialised examination of the bog was required because of the hydrological and topographic complexities of this particular site. This results of this examination, undertaken this year, mean that it has not been possible to rule out, beyond reasonable scientific doubt, the threat of peat failure (bog burst) if turf cutting resumes in the south of the bog, as required by article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive. </p>  <p>  Consequently, a final phase of concentrated geophysical and hydrological investigations is scheduled to be carried out in early 2019 to assess the level of risk of peat failure in the proposed domestic turf cutting area in the south of the site.</p></reply>

The Government  also authorised the initiation of discussions on the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  The overall aim  of the Government decision in relation to the proposed transfer of the RT&Eacute; NSO is to enable the orchestra to be established as a world class orchestra which would, with the NCH, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that would greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public. </p>  <p>  An Oversight Group has been established with formal terms of reference, with a view to identifying and addressing the relevant issues to enable the successful transfer of the NSO from the remit of RT&Eacute; to the remit of the NCH. The group has already met on two occasions.  In addition, a Working Group, as a subset of the oversight group, has been tasked at examining the detailed issues involved in the proposed transfer of the orchestra.</p>  <p>  No costs have been incurred by my Department to date in relation to this decision.  Both the Oversight and Working Groups will, inter alia, examine the costs involved in moving the RT&Eacute; NSO to the National Concert Hall.  </p>  <p>  At this point, it is considered that 2020 would be the earliest date for the completion of the proposed transfer.</p>  <p>  My Department welcomes the opportunity to work with all stakeholders including the members of the  RT&Eacute; NSO to ensure that it can contribute fully to Ireland&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage.</p></reply>

They would be in the best position to advise on the estimated cost of any assessment. </p>  <p>  My Department provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the Structures at Risk Fund (SRF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS), which are administered by local authorities. This year I have allocated &euro;1.3m and &euro;2m respectively to these schemes. The SRF will be revamped for 2019 and I will be launching the 2019 schemes shortly. It will be a matter for Sligo County Council to determine whether they wish to apply for funding under these schemes.  </p>  <p>  In the context of a particular building or historic structure, the best advice is generally to contact the Heritage Officer or Architectural Conservation Officer in the local authority who is well placed to advise on the various types of funding available to assist with its renovation or conservation.  Court Abbey is also recorded on the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP) for County Sligo and my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service would be happy to provide any archaeological advice or guidance that might be of assistance.</p></reply>
