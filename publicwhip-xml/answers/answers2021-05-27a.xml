The Government approved our proposals and also approved the drafting of legislation to give effect to their central elements.  </p><p>The proposals provide for full access to birth and early life information for people who are affected by illegal birth registration or who suspect that they may be.They address the issue of correcting the birth registration of affected individuals, and providing them with choice and clarity in matters relating to their identity.  </p><p>They also provide a process to ensure that the parents who raised them can be acknowledged as their legal parents, where that is the person&rsquo;s wish.  I am pleased to have been able to bring forward proposals in this sensitive and complex area, which I believe will address the issues raised for those who, through no fault of their own, have been affected by Illegal Birth Registrations</p><p>The proposals are set out in the Heads of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill which I published on 11 May.  I have referred the Heads of Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny and I understand that this process is now underway.</p><p>At the same time, I have commenced a consultation process with individuals who have been affected by illegal birth registrations and their views will inform finalisation of the legislation.  </p><p>The IDG proposals also considered the matter of succession, and my colleague, the Minister for Justice has committed, to amending the Succession Act 1965 without delay to ensure that those affected will, for the purposes of the Act, be deemed to be the children of the people who raised them.</p><p>More generally, I am committed to continued engagement with the affected individuals on  all matters of concern and to advancing the Birth Information and Tracing legislation as a matter of priority.  </p></reply>

At my specific request the review will include an assessment of the Scheme&rsquo;s impact on services operating in disadvantaged communities. </p><p>The review will provide a basis for my Department to consider how effectively the NCS is operating and whether it is meeting the objectives which can be measured meaningfully  within the first year. It is intended to publish the findings from this Review in the last quarter of this year.</p><p>In addition, an Expert Group convened by my Department is examining the current model of funding for early learning and childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. </p><p>The Group is considering how additional funding can be delivered to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area.  The Group will submit its recommendations later this year. The development of a DEIS type model for early learning and childcare will be among the recommendations. </p></reply>

Over the period 2015-2019, more 27,433 new places were funded under this Programme.</p><p>I was pleased to be able to make funding of &euro;10.5m available under the Annual Capital Programme for 2021.  Of this funding:</p><p>- &euro;5m has been allocated across 643 services to carry out remedial works to ensure these services will be fully compliant with fire safety standards as set out in Tulsa's registration requirements; and</p><p>- &euro;5.5million will allocated across all registered early learning and childcare services to enable them to improve outdoor play facilities. </p><p>Further details of these outdoor play grants will be announced next week.</p><p>On the question of capital grants to increase capacity, the demand for additional places in the sector is currently under review.  I am conscious that since the onset of Covid-19, there is evidence of depressed demand for early learning and childcare, largely due to changes in parental work arrangements.  </p><p>We need to assess carefully the likely demand for places in the years ahead. It is important to plan ahead appropriately, on the basis of the best data and projections of likely demand available.</p><p>The Annual Early Years Sector Profile Survey 2021, due to commence this month, will allow updated information on capacity to be gathered. In addition, an Ipsos/MRBI survey of parents is currently underway to assess likely parental demand for early learning and childcare from September 2022.</p><p>These data will help inform capital investment plans and the prioritisation of future capital funding, including funding allocated under Project Ireland 2040. I have made a detailed submission in relation to Capital Funding in the Early Years sector to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></reply>

The Scheme is under review at present, and this provides us with an opportunity to consider any possible changes to sponsorship arrangements.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme represents the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for early learning and childcare. </p><p>It marks a shift away from previous schemes, which were based on medical card and social protection entitlements to offer a progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  </p><p>The scheme is designed so that those on lowest incomes receive the greatest support. </p><p>The NCS also includes sponsorship arrangements that allows for additional support for vulnerable families where there is an identified need for early learning and childcare on the grounds of child development or child welfare.</p><p>There are currently five sponsorship arrangements in place. This includes the Department of Education who can make NCS referrals for teen parents under the age of 18 so they can remain in education or training. </p><p>I am committed to reviewing and extending these arrangement where appropriate.</p><p>A formal review of the NCS has commenced, as required under Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act 2018. It is intended that a finalised report of this review will be published in late 2021. At my specific request the review will include an assessment of the Scheme&rsquo;s impact on services operating in disadvantaged communities. </p><p>The review will provide a basis for the DCEDIY to consider how effectively the NCS is operating and whether it is meeting the objectives which are meaningfully measurable within the first year. </p><p>Based on this Review, I will consider any necessary changes to enhance the NCS, including arrangements for sponsorship.</p></reply>

This brought annual funding provided to youth services by my Department to almost &euro;70m in 2021.</p><p>Last year my Department worked alongside the Department of Health and the youth sector, in collaboration with SpunOut.ie, to undertake an online survey of young people&rsquo;s experiences of COVID-19. </p><p>The publication of the <i>How&rsquo;s Your Head</i>report has been shared with Government colleagues to inform the development of responses to COVID-19 particularly as relevant to the needs of young people. </p><p>The consultation asked young people what had been working well for them, and what challenges they have faced in maintaining their wellbeing during COVID-19. A Youth Advisory Group worked alongside my Department to guide the development and analysis of the consultation.  2,173 young people, aged 15-24, responded to the consultation and the findings included:</p><p>- 37% of young people expressed optimism. This was higher for those who engaged with youth groups/clubs/services.</p><p>- 58% of reported feelings about their future were negative, including anxiety, pessimism, fear and sadness; a figure that was highest amongst marginalised groups.</p><p>- Young people reported missing friends, health problems, isolation, loss of social life and work among the impacts of COVID-19.</p><p>- The report also provided ideas and feedback from the youth advisory group on how to address the findings.  </p><p>My Department will continue to support youth services to play their part in enabling young people to maintain their mental and physical health. </p><p>My Department has met regularly with youth sector representatives throughout the pandemic to address emerging issues and ensure that young people, particularly those who are vulnerable, continue to be supported. </p></reply>

The programme runs from September to June each year.  ECCE is not mandatory, but participation rates are very high, with 95% of children in the eligible age range attending.</p><p>Pobal administers the ECCE programme on behalf of my Department, and they have informed me that there are 880 services providing the ECCE Programme in Cork city and county. Currently, there are 12,130 children availing of the ECCE Programme across these services.</p><p>Payment under the ECCE programme is by way of capitation, payable directly to services in respect of each eligible child enrolled. The total funding allocated to these 880 services for the period 01 January 2020 to 21 May 2021 was &euro;43.7m.</p><p>Since the onset of Covid-19, there has been some changes to ECCE funding owing to various Covid-19 restrictions. </p><p>Over the initial closure of services in 2020 (from 12 March-29 June), funding under the ECCE programme and other DCEDIY schemes was redirected towards the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme.</p><p>Since September 2020, in addition to capitation provided under the ECCE Programme, all services were eligible to avail of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which at current rates, covers up to 50% of services operating costs.</p><p>The ECCE Programme closed over 6 January to 8 March 2021, when services were restricted to children of essential workers and vulnerable children only.</p><p>Over the period 6 - 31 January, services continued to receive full ECCE funding, in addition to EWSS.</p><p>From 1 February -7 March, ECCE funding was reduced to 70% for closed services but was maintained at 100% for open services.</p><p>The continuation of ECCE funding during that period, and other supports provided by my Department, was conditional on services retaining staff, continuing to engage with children enrolled on the Programme and waiving fees where children were not accessing a service.  </p><p>The ECCE programme resumed on 8 March 2021, with no significant drop in enrolment rates. Moreover, there is strong evidence of the effectiveness of Covid-19 supports, with the data on services that have closed and opened in 2020 are directly comparable to 2019.</p></reply>

I have had a lengthy engagement wth the Chair of the Board, Pat Rabbitte. I have not had a separate meeting with the entire Board of Tusla on this matter because I am satisfied that it is being handled appropriately in other ways. </p>  <p>  My most recent meeting with the Board was my quarterly meeting on the 13th April, before the ransomware attack occurred. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Board has been fully briefed by the CEO, which is the normal approach. </p>  <p>  The CEO of Tusla is providing daily verbal updates to the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the Organisational Development Committee as the situation evolves and he has also provided a number of written updates to the Board. </p>  <p>  My officials are in daily contact with Tusla since being alerted to the attack on 14 May, to ensure risks can be mitigated as much as possible and frontline services can be maintained. The Deputy will no doubt recall the detailed oral briefing from the CEO of Tusla and the many issues discussed with him in our call on Friday last, 21 May. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also have received the letter issued by the Tusla CEO to members of the Oireachtas Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration on the same day which outlined the actions taken by the Agency since the attack.  </p>  <p>  The containment shut down actioned by Tusla on the 14th May was taken as a security measure, given that many of Tusla's key systems and some legacy and corporate systems are hosted on the HSE network.   Nonetheless, the consequent disruption and impact on service delivery and the potential exfiltration of individuals' highly sensitive and personal information has been of great concern to me. </p>  <p>My priority, and that of Tusla, is to ensure that the critical services and supports for the protection, welfare and care of our children continue to operate within these very challenging circumstances.</p></reply>

Drafting of the State Report is ongoing.</p>  <p>  On the 3 December 2020, I published a draft version of the Initial State report for a period of public consultation. The public consultation stage closed on the 9 April 2021. </p>  <p>   The public consultation process involved a number of strands.  Stakeholders were invited to make written submissions to my Department.  Seventy submissions have been received in this regard.</p>  <p>   In addition, my Department ran three days of online public stakeholder consultation events in March and April.  The recently established Disability Participation and Consultation Network, which involves a wide range of disability stakeholders, has carried out its own consultation process and has submitted it to the Department.  Finally, my Department is consulting with children and young people on UNCRPD. </p>  <p>  I believe that we have benefited considerably from the important process of stakeholder consultation, and that the final version of the State Report will be able to reflect the views and experiences offered so fully by participants.  I intend to bring the State Report to Government for approval in the normal way, in advance of formally submitting it to the Committee later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-27a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052700057#WRA03000"><p>I am committed to commencing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act by June 2022, and I do not envisage a delay to that date at this point.  The Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government to commencing the Act, recognising the importance of the much needed reform it represents.  The Act is a very important piece of legislation that changes the existing law on capacity from the status approach of the wardship system to a flexible functional approach, whereby capacity is assessed on an issue- and time-specific basis and the wards of court system for adults is abolished.</p>  <p>  The timescale for commencement of the Act is influenced by two principal factors.  The Decision Support Service, which is the organisation that will operate the progressive provisions of the Act, has to become operational and to be able to respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties.  Amendments are also required to the Act before full commencement can take place.  Work is taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which I expect to have enacted by the end of this year.   These amendments will streamline processes, in the interests of those using its provisions.  They will also strengthen the safeguards included in the Act.</p>  <p>  Some provisions of the Act have been commenced to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service; the establishment of a multidisciplinary working group in relation to Advance Healthcare Directives; and most recently, on 1February this year, the repeal of the outdated Marriage of Lunatics Act 1811, which means that a ward can now marry if she or he has capacity to do so. </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service has made considerable progress in putting in place the administrative and IT systems needed to operate the Act.  To this end I have secured a budget of &euro;5.8 million for the Decision Support Service in 2021, a significant increase on its &euro;3.5 million 2020 budget.</p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group, chaired by my Department, meets monthly to oversee and drive progress towards full commencement.  The Steering Group comprises senior officials from the Department of Health, the Department of Justice, the Mental Health Commission, the HSE, the Courts Service, and the Decision Support Service, recognising that successful operation of the Act will involve multiple stakeholders.  They are working towards commencement of the legislation in June 2022, with the Decision Support Service opening for business immediately thereafter.</p>  <p>  I recognise the concerns expressed by those who are in need of the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act.  However, it is also important that we develop robust systems under the Decision Support Service that respond adequately to the needs of those with capacity difficulties and of their families.  I am confident that the time that we devote now to getting this process right will give us a person-centred approach that will truly be in the interests of those who need it most.</p></reply>

It is too early or perhaps impossible to be absolute about protections against the attack in the context of the criminal activity underpinning it. I am satisfied however that the Agency's risk management approach has identified the relevant risks associated with the attack and is putting in place the appropriate mitigating actions. I am also satisfied that the full resources of the State are being deployed to protect the Agency, and more importantly, the sensitive and personal information of service users associated with the Agency's files and data systems.</p></reply>

The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for international protection from the beginning of February. The pilot will continue until end 2021, at which point it will be evaluated, and this will be used to inform the long term implementation of vulnerability assessments. </p>  <p>  The purpose of these assessments is to determine if, by virtue of a particular category of vulnerability, an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. </p>  <p>  IPAS assess the vulnerability of everyone who makes an application for international protection to the International Protection Office (IPO). Where an application includes children of an applicant, IPAS also assess their vulnerability in an appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  The Vulnerability Assessment begins with an initial interview after the applicant first applies for international protection.  If this initial assessment indicates that the applicant is a vulnerable person, within the meaning of the relevant EU Directive,  further assessments may be carried out while the applicant is living in the IPAS Reception Centre, or subsequently when they have moved to longer term accommodation. </p>  <p>  Taken together, these assessments are used to determine whether the applicant has special reception needs arising from any vulnerabilities identified. IPAS will endeavour to accommodate these needs in so far as possible.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the interview stays to its purpose, the assessor will be provided with a standard list of assessment questions. These questions are based on the various categories of vulnerability identified within the EU Reception Conditions Directive and the Irish Regulations, and have been refined within the Irish context with the help of the HSE. The assessment will be carried out in a sensitive, conversational manner with gender-appropriate officers and interpretation as required.   </p>  <p>  It is intended that the questions used will be kept under review during the pilot phase and refined to ensure the process continues to elicit the best possible information to assist in the assessment.</p></reply>

Key achievements include:</p><p>- Since 2015, State investment has increased by 141%.</p><p>- Since 2018, all children are entitled to two full years of the ECCE Programme. For the current programme year, there are more than 102,000 children enrolled.</p><p>- The National Childcare Scheme was introduced in 2019. To date, over 105,200 applications have been submitted for the NCS relating to over 99,400 children.</p><p>- Since 2016, the Access and Inclusion Model or AIM, has supported almost 15,300 children with a disability to access and meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme.</p><p>- Over the period 2015-2019, 27,433 ELC/SAC places were funded under my Department&rsquo;s Annual Capital Programme.</p><p>Steps have also been taken to improve quality. This includes regulatory reform, the introduction of new qualification requirements and continued roll-out of training in the curriculum and quality frameworks.</p><p>Since the onset of Covid-19, my Department has also focused on putting in place a range of supports for ELC/SAC. The objective of these supports have been to:</p><p>- support providers&rsquo; sustainability to enable services return to normal once restrictions were lifted; </p><p>- support providers to retain their staff; </p><p>- ensure that ELC/SAC could reopen and remain open, even at very low levels of occupancy; </p><p>- ensure that ELC/SAC could operate safely for children, families and staff; </p><p>- ensure that increased costs associated with public health requirements, and lower demand / occupancy were not passed on to parents; </p><p>- achieve administrative efficiency through the continued use of existing funding schemes and other whole of economy supports; and </p><p>- protect exchequer investment.</p><p>Supports included the continuation of DCEDIY subsidy schemes on an ex-gratia basis (12 March &ndash; 5 April 2020); the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (6 April &ndash; 28 June 2020); the Reopening Funding Package (29 June &ndash; 23 August 2020), the July Stimulus Package that included the EWSS and a Sustainability Fund (from 24 August to end December 2020) and tailored funding arrangements to respond to Level 5 restrictions in the post-Christmas period, that included a new Covid-19 Operating Support Payment and a new Covid-19 strand of the Sustainability Fund, in addition to the EWSS.</p><p>There is strong evidence of the effectiveness of these supports.  Data on services that have closed and opened in 2020 are directly comparable to 2019 so there has been no loss of capacity. Revenue data indicates that the number of employees in the sector has not changed substantially over the course of the pandemic. Moreover, data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2020 revealed no significant increase in fees charged to parents. </p><p>While my Department continues to respond COVID-19 challenges in the sector, the importance of long-term and long-lasting development and reform is ever more important and progress continues to be made in this area.</p><p>One of the major objectives in the First 5 Strategy, is that babies and young children have access to safe, high-quality, developmentally appropriate ELC/SAC which reflects diversity of need. To meet this objective, the following Strategic Actions have been identified:</p><p>- Make high-quality ELC/SAC for more affordable </p><p>- Maintain and extend the supply of high-quality ELC/SAC; and</p><p>- Ensure that ELC/SAC provision promotes participation, strengthens social inclusion and embraces diversity.  </p><p>To meet this objective, First 5 identified a range of actions and also signposts major reforms, including a new workforce development plan, a new funding model and a new operating model for the sector. There is also a commitment to at least double investment in ELC/SAC by 2028. </p><p>The First 5 Annual Implementation Report 2019 published in November 2020 reports on progress made on these actions, with 90% of all 2019 milestones met. </p><p>The First 5 Annual Implementation Report 2020 will be published in the coming months.</p></reply>

Both have distinct functions, powers, responsibilities and methods of working, as assigned by legislation and agency protocols. Their close cooperation ensures that children in need of protection receive a timely, appropriate and proportionate response.</p>  <p>  Tusla assess and supports the protection needs of the child, while the focus of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to preserve life; vindicate the human rights of each individual; and prevent, investigate and detect criminal offences.</p>  <p>  The cooperation between the agencies on this matter is provided for by a Joint Working Protocol. This sets out the tasks, roles and obligations of both organisations in relation to each other in matters of child protection. </p>  <p>  The protocol identifies two-way formal and informal communication processes between Tusla social workers and Garda&iacute; to record suspected cases of abuse. Where more than one child is involved separate notifications are processed in respect of each child.</p>  <p>  In relation to specific cases, social workers and Garda&iacute; may hold strategic liaison meetings as part of their working together. Their joint efforts are designed to ensure that the protection of children receives priority attention.</p>  <p>  The joint working collaboration gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through a Tusla social worker, relevant information on the Tusla Child Protection Notification System. This is a list of just under 1,000 children nationally who have an active Tusla led child safety plan.  Social workers and Garda&iacute; undergo joint specialist training in interviewing children where there are concerns regarding a sexual assault and, where possible, carry out joint interviews. </p>  <p>  A signification step in inter-agency cooperation is the development of Barnahus, a child-friendly, interdisciplinary and multi-agency model of service for children who have been sexually abused. The model establishes a set of principles and operational methodology to facilitate the different agencies working together in a consistent and child centred way. Barnahus provides a single secure location for professional services (therapists, social work, Garda&iacute;, medical and forensic investigation) to support child sex abuse victims and their families. </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group (IDG) comprising members from my Department, the Department of Health, Department of Justice, Tusla, HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is developing Barnahus. A National Agency Steering Committee has been established by the IDG to organise and oversee operational matters associated with the development and management of Barnahus nationally. </p>  <p>  A Pilot service was launched in Galway in 2018 and further developed sites are planned for Dublin and Cork in 2021. The centres will develop regional outreach capacity over time. Victims will be met and interviewed by a specially trained social worker and a Garda specialist working together. </p>  <p>  It is intended, that the Barnahus and Sexual Assault Treatment Unit services will align where possible to facilitate close working relationship needed in the case of teenage victims requiring a mix of adult (forensic) services and a child protection service.</p></reply>

Comhairle gets children and young people's voices heard in two main ways. The young members identify and work on areas of interest to them in their local communities . They also serve as a consultative forum when decisions are being made at local and often national level. Every two years, members of each Comhairle come together at Dail na n&Oacute;g, to elect a National Executive and to identify and vote on the key areas they will work on over the following two years.  My Department supports the National Executive to bring their ideas and projects to the relevant policy makers at national level, amplifying the voice of young people and effecting real change. </p><p>Another significant support to enhance the capacity of government departments, state agencies and other organisations to consult meaningfully with children and young people is the <i>National Implementation Framework for Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-Making</i>, which I launched in April  This Framework provides guidance and checklists for those wishing to consult with children and young people, promoting participation with purpose, where their views are listened to, taken seriously and given due weight with the intention of leading to an outcome or change.  The Framework underpins the work of my department and the soon to be established National Participation Office. Combined with the training and support of an enhanced Hug na n&Oacute;g, these resources  build on and extend capacity to consult meaningfully with children and young people.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the<i>National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-Making</i>is a constituent strategy of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020</i>, which concluded at the end of 2020.  Progression of a policy successor to <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures </i>has been delayed until 2022. This decision has been made in light of Covid-19, and two significant initiatives my Department is progressing in 2021. These are, namely, implementation of the EU Child Guarantee and development of Ireland&rsquo;s reporting to the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Rights Convention. It is envisaged that both of these initiatives, and the impacts of the pandemic, will inform the priorities to be addressed in the successor to <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, </i>and its constituent strategies  <i>.</i></p></reply>

My Department is currently examining the feasibility of introducing such proposals and has committed to developing a report to Government in June, with legislative proposals to follow.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a scheme of domestic violence leave is currently being developed by officials in my Department, which includes the examination of domestic violence leave at international level, the identification of best practice and the development of a suitable model for rollout in Ireland.  The outcome of this work will inform policy development and proposals in this area. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged in a targeted consultation process with relevant stakeholders and social partners to examine how a scheme of paid leave should operate to address the needs of victims most effectively, including with the monitoring committee of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, employers' groups and trade unions and with stakeholders of the national Equality Strategy Committees falling under my Department&rsquo;s remit. Written submissions were invited from relevant stakeholders and these submissions are currently being examined. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the report, including the output of the consultation process, will be brought to Government in June.</p></reply>

Advancing the implementation of the UNCRPD is an ongoing priority. Our approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation, each year moving forward on key reforms.  </p>  <p>  The obligations arising from the Convention will be met over time, with initial priority given to meeting legislative commitments. For example, my Department is responsible for the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which is an important step towards full implementation of the UNCRPD. </p>  <p>  In addition, the UNCRPD requires State parties actively to involve people with disabilities in policy development. In order to progress this aspect of the UNCRPD, my Department has funded the development of a Participation and Consultation Network to build capacity within the disability community so that people with disabilities and their representative organisations can participate fully in policy development.  The Network was formed in late 2020. One of the Network&rsquo;s first tasks has been to bring the voices of people with disabilities into consultations on Ireland&rsquo;s first State Report to the UN on our progress in implementing the UNCRPD.  This Network is an important initiative that will help us to realise both the spirit and the substance of the UNCRPD here in Ireland. It will provide a platform for people with disabilities to become actively involved in issues that affect their lives. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to establishing a UNCRPD Implementation Plan. This Plan will coordinate and monitor progress on implementing the UNCRPD across Government departments. Work on this Plan is at an early stage. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently responsible for coordinating the two significant whole of Government strategies that currently exist in the area of Disability, namely the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES). These are the key frameworks for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland and support effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the UNCRPD.  </p>  <p>  The UNCRPD operates in a similar manner to other UN Human Rights treaties.  The State is required to prepare a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Convention in Ireland and this will be followed by a public appearance before the CRPD Committee in Geneva.</p>  <p>  Ireland is preparing its first State Report. My Department is responsible for preparing the Report, in consultation with other Departments and Agencies who have responsibility for implementing the Convention. The report will set out how Ireland is implementing the Convention. It will describe progress in a number of areas and acknowledge where further action is required for Ireland to comply fully with the Convention.  </p>  <p>  Ms Anne Rabbitte T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, published the draft State Report in December 2020 and a public consultation process has recently concluded.  The Report, incorporating the information obtained during the public consultation process, will then be brought to Government for approval in advance of its formal submission to the Committee by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva later this year. </p>  <p>  Following the submission of the State Report, Ireland will take part in an appearance with the UN Committee.  The information gathered at this appearance will inform the Committee's report on how Ireland is implementing the UNCRPD and I would expect their report to include recommendations on areas for improvements.  There is no indication at this time on a likely date for that appearance.</p></reply>

Covid-19 and new blended working patterns has reduced demand for some early learning and childcare services, and I recognise that this may not be a permanent change, the provision of new childcare places is not a current priority.</p>  <p>  The upgrading of the fire safety measures in place in existing early learning and childcare services is the key objective of the 2021 Capital Programme, which is worth a total of &euro;10.5 million.</p>  <p>  The first tranche of capital grants were assigned on 21 May to existing services to improving fire safety standards.  Service providers were invited to apply for funding to carry out remedial works, with a total of &euro;5 million of the &euro;10.5 million budget being claimed by  634 services.    These works will permit these services to fully comply with the Tulsa's registration requirements.  Services received funding under this capital programme on 23 May 2021.</p>  <p>  The remaining capital funding of &euro;5.5million will be shared between all registered early learning and childcare services to enable them to encourage more outdoor play.   Eligible expenditure will include shelters and play equipment.  Outdoor play enables children to explore and engage with the natural world, while being a simple and effective method of infection control.

HIQA's new  Draft National Standards for Children&rsquo;s Social Services are intended to replace four current sets of standards that cover child protection and welfare services, children's residential care, special care and to replace the 2003 foster care standards  </p><p>HIQA has undertaken a  consultative process with Tusla managers and staff, foster carers, interested agencies and the general public, and 20% of the responses have been from foster carers.  </p><p>As current National Standards for Foster Care have been in place since 2003 it is important that they are reviewed.  It is also very important that all stakeholders have confidence in the utility and applicability of these standards.</p><p>I have received a request to meet the Irish Foster Care Association and I plan to do so in the coming weeks. My officials have had close engagement with them and are fully aware of the issues involved. Foster carers have indicated that the current draft standards fail to adequately comprehend the role and unique care response provided by Foster carers, as they are not professionals, staff or employees and their care response is unique.</p><p>I am committed, as is HIQA, to ensure their voice is heard in the development of the new standards. My officials are actively engaged with HIQA on this issue and I understand HIQA are taking steps to revise their approach by providing more detail pertaining to foster care as part of the standard development process. </p><p>The proposed new standards do not change existing legislation and therefore have no impact on any legal rights or duties of foster carers under the Child Care Acts, Children First legislation and guidance or any new legislation under consideration. Legislation and regulations supersede standards in all sectors.</p><p>Following completion of the consultation and drafting process HIQA will present the Draft National Standards for Children&rsquo;s Social Services for consideration and approval by the Minister for Health and myself. The Standards must be accepted and approved in advance of their becoming operational.  </p></reply>

As Minister with responsibility for Tusla, I sit on the ministerial group dealing with the Cyber-attack and have been in contact with CEO on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  As an independent agency, Tusla has responsibility for its own ICT function and has engaged with the HSE, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the Garda&iacute; in relation to this incident.

This funding is provided where there is a genuine need and demand for services and where they can be provided at low cost to adults, couples, children, young people and families.  </p>  <p>  Tusla, in partnership with the HSE Health and Wellbeing and Community Healthcare, also supports the Mental Health Promotion Project across 6 Health and Wellbeing Community Referral Sites in Cork and Kerry. This supports FRCs in promoting best practice in relation to suicide prevention and the promotion of positive mental health. Tusla also supports some FRCs in the provision of regional therapeutic hubs for Tusla service users in the wider area. </p>  <p>  I recently met with the Family Resource Centre National Forum (FRCNF) and they described first-hand the surge in demand that FRCs are managing due to an increase in mental health issues within their communities. The accessibility of FRCs means they are well placed to provide opportunities for early identification of need, provision of appropriate interventions and alignment of community approaches with statutory services. </p>  <p>  While I am interested in the benefits of these services, any potential funding in this area is dependent on the availability of resources. It is also important to ensure that FRCs continue to access diverse funding streams, as much of their work is in collaboration with other bodies, such as the HSE. </p>  <p>  With regard to long-term funding, I am acutely conscious of the challenges posed for service planning by the annual nature of the budgetary cycle. The management of grant funding is governed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Circular 13/2014 with regard to the management of and accountability for grants from Exchequer funds. While I would welcome further discussion in relation to this, the Public Spending Code and any move to providing long term or multi-annual funding would be a matter for central Government, and could require significant cross-government and legislative consideration.</p></reply>

I have personally engaged with survivors and advocacy groups since my appointment and will continue to engage with those most centrally involved with these matters. Most recently, I have hosted virtual meetings with interested parties in relation the published Heads and General Scheme of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill.  I continue to listen carefully to stakeholders on this issue to ensure this legislation can right an historic wrong by providing access to birth certificates and early life information.</p>  <p>  In responding to the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation, the Government approved the development of a Strategic Action Plan encompassing a suite of 22 specific measures.  These measures, which take account of the Commission's recommendations and those of the Collaborative Forum, are a response to the priority needs and concerns of former residents and their families. </p>  <p>  Most importantly, I recognise the importance of implementing these measures in a survivor-centred way, characterised by consistent engagement with former residents and their representative groups, including those who live outside the jurisdiction. Notably, several hundred survivors have contacted my Department since the report was published.  Many of these individuals had never been in contact with us before and they want to actively contribute to the process. An increased level of engagement is also evident from the consultation process established to inform development of a Restorative Recognition Scheme, with approximately 450 written submissions received and 159 participants in 17 online meetings. </p>  <p>  I am of the view that stakeholder engagement at this level requires additional dedicated structures, processes and resources to ensure it can be inclusive, effective and sustainable. To this end, I am currently consulting with members of the Collaborative Forum, as I believe that learning from existing processes can assist in developing new and enhanced approaches as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  I held two virtual meetings with members of the Collaborative Forum in February during which the structures to support future stakeholder engagement was a specific agenda item. In recognising the limited time available during plenary discussions, my department requested the facilitator to the Forum to further engage with members. I understand this process is nearing completion and look forward to hearing their feedback. The experience of Forum members, and other stakeholders, will assist the development and transition to a new, enhanced model of engagement. </p>  <p>  As I have acknowledged previously, plenary meetings of Collaborative Forum have unfortunately been interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Having met in December 2019, it was necessary to put these meetings on hold in 2020 in the context of the public health restrictions as a number of members travel from outside the jurisdiction and some members are also in the at-risk groups identified by public health authorities.  </p>  <p>  Throughout 2020, members of the Forum were updated on relevant matters by the Secretariat to the group based in my Department. It is the practice and policy of my Department to issue updates and announcements to the Forum and other relevant stakeholders before they are issued to the public more generally. Most recently, there was contact with the Forum in relation to an invitation for representatives to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability and Integration in relation to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill. The Joint Oireachtas Committee has held a number of meetings dedicated to pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. I was pleased to see the Committee directly engage with members of the Collaborative Forum and I welcome the priority which the Committee has afforded this pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Collaborative Forum&rsquo;s report, it was not possible to publish the report when it was submitted to the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs because of concerns that its contents encroached upon the work of the independent statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  For this reason, the Forum's recommendations were initially published and a commitment was given to revisit the question of publication following the completion of the Commission's work. Arrangements are being advanced by my Department to address the procedural requirement for identifiable parties to be afforded due process prior to publication. I expect this process to be completed in the coming weeks. I will then be in a position to engage further with the Collaborative Forum to finalise arrangements for the publication of the report. </p></reply>

The Action Plan centres on distinct themes including: access to personal information; archiving and databases; education and research; memorialisation; dignified burial, and restorative recognition. These themes take account of the Commission's recommendations and are intended to respond to the priority needs and concerns of former residents and their families.</p>  <p>  Many of these measures are complex and require considerable coordination across Government to implement but I am committed to ensuring that survivors see tangible results as early as possible.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that counselling supports were immediately available to survivors and relevant details are available on my Department's website.  These telephone based and face-to-face services continue to be available to any person who may require support through the established nationwide network of HSE counselling supports.</p>  <p>  Most importantly, I recognise the importance of implementing these measures in a survivor-centred way. Notably, several hundred survivors have contacted my Department since the Commission&rsquo;s report was published. In responding to this increased demand for direct engagement, we are developing new structures for an enhanced model of survivor engagement. The aim is to create a model capable of supporting sustained communication with survivors and their representative groups in Ireland and abroad.</p>  <p>  I tasked an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) with developing detailed proposals for a Restorative Recognition Scheme to provide a financial payment and a form of enhanced medical card. While the IDG must take account of the specific recommendations made by the Commission, its considerations are not limited to those recommendations.  The approach of the IDG is underpinned by a human rights focus and informed by an extensive consultation process.  The consultation process was undertaken during March and April with almost 450 written submissions received and 159 participants in 17 online meetings. The IDG is working hard to deliver its report to me.  I will then be in a position to bring recommendations to Government for its decision on the parameters of the scheme.</p>  <p>  I recently published the Heads and General Scheme of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill. In giving effect to my commitment to a survivor centred approach, I have hosted virtual meetings with interested parties in relation to the legislative proposals. I continue to listen carefully to stakeholders on this issue to ensure we can balance personal rights in a fair and compassionate way and right an historic wrong by providing access to birth certificates and early life information. </p>  <p>  Related to this legislative work, my Department has recruited an archivist who is leading the work on the preservation of, and public access to, relevant records within my Department. The archivist is part of a new Information Management Unit established to manage the Commission&rsquo;s archive of records and support compliance with GDPR, including providing access for individuals to their personal information. The archivist will also support expert consideration of future work on the creation of a central repository of records. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability and Integration. This legislation is required to support the proposed interventions at the Tuam site. It will also enable intervention at any other institutional sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place. I welcome the priority which the Committee has afforded this pre-legislative scrutiny and I look forward to its report contributing to the development of this legislation.</p>  <p>  My Department, in collaboration with the Irish Research Council, has commissioned NUI Galway to undertake a research project on language and terminology. The aim of this project is to highlight the stigmatising and labelling language that has been used in the past and to provide guidance as to how to address this issue. The method used will be a 'history of the present' approach which aims to critically analyse the past to help inform the present and the future.</p>  <p>  My Department is also advancing separate proposals with the Irish Research Council for a new scholarship programme on childhood disadvantage. I expect further details on this programme to be announced over the summer.  </p>  <p>  Along with the Commemorative Grant Scheme, established to support survivors in commemorating their experiences in a manner which fits their own specific needs, my Department is scoping the approach to memorialisation initiatives to enable these important measures to be advanced with relevant agencies. </p>  <p>  Implementing the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan is a hugely important process for all connected to these institutions and I will continue to work with Government colleagues and survivors to advance related measures.</p></reply>

The Decision Support Service, which is the organisation that will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act, has to become operational and to be able to respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties.  Amendments are also required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place.  Work is actively taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which is expected to be enacted by year end.  Priority drafting has been secured and publication of the Bill is expected in the Autumn.  The amendments will streamline processes in the interests of those using its provisions.  They will also strengthen the safeguards included in the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>Some provisions of the Act have been commenced to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service; the establishment of a multidisciplinary working group in relation to Advance Healthcare Directives; and most recently, on the 1st   of February this year, the repeal of the Marriage of Lunatics Act, which means that a ward can now marry if she or he has capacity to do so. </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service has made considerable progress in putting in place the administrative and IT systems needed to operate the 2015 Act.  To this end a budget of &euro;5.8 million was secured for the Decision Support Service for 2021, a significant increase on its &euro;3.5 million 2020 budget.</p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, meets monthly to oversee and drive progress towards full commencement.  The Steering Group comprises senior officials from the Department of Health, the Department of Justice, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Decision Support Service, recognising that successful operation of the 2015 Act will involve multiple stakeholders.  They are working towards commencement of the 2015 Act in June 2022, with the Decision Support Service opening for business immediately thereafter.</p></reply>

The objective of these supports have been to:</p><p>- support providers&rsquo; sustainability to enable services return to normal once restrictions were lifted; </p><p>- support providers to retain their staff; </p><p>- ensure that ELC/SAC could reopen and remain open, even at very low levels of occupancy; </p><p>- ensure that ELC/SAC could operate safely for children, families and staff; </p><p>- ensure that increased costs associated with public health requirements, and lower demand / occupancy were not passed on to parents; </p><p>- achieve administrative efficiency through the continued use of existing funding schemes and other whole of economy supports; and </p><p>- protect exchequer investment.</p><p>Supports include the continuation of DCEDIY subsidy schemes on an ex-gratia basis (12 March &ndash; 5 April 2020); the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (6 April &ndash; 28 June 2020); the Reopening Funding Package (29 June &ndash; 23 August 2020), the July Stimulus Package that included the EWSS and a Sustainability Fund (from 24 August to end December 2020) and tailored funding arrangements to respond to Level 5 restrictions in the post-Christmas period, that included a new Covid-19 Operating Support Payment and a new Covid-19 strand of the Sustainability Fund, in addition to the EWSS.</p><p>ELC/SAC employers continue to be entitled to access the EWSS with an exemption to having to demonstrate the drop in turnover that applies to other sectors.  Since October 2020, EWSS has been paid at enhanced rates and these rates are estimated to cover, on average, 80% of staff costs in the sector, or 50% of total operating costs.  </p><p>There is strong evidence of the effectiveness of these supports.  </p><p>The data on services that have closed and opened in 2020 are directly comparable to 2019 so there has been no loss of capacity: </p><p>- 197 services that were on the Early Years Register reported permanent closure to Tusla in 2020 compared to 196 in 2019.  </p><p>- 91 new services were registered in 2020 compared to 93 in 2019. </p><p>Data from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners indicates that the number of employees in the sector has not changed substantially over the course of the pandemic </p><p>Data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2020 Survey revealed no significant increase in fees charged to parents. The 2021 Survey will shortly go live to all providers to enable the collection of additional data on the impact of the Covid-19 and the measures taken by Government to support the sector.  I anticipate this data being available in the coming months.  </p><p>Planning is current underway by the Department of Finance in respect of the next phase of the EWSS and officials in my Department have engaged in this planning in respect of the ELC/SAC sector.</p></reply>

Specific commitments are included in the Action Plan on SAC (published in 2017), which sets a strategic direction for SAC, and in <i>First 5</i>(which covers the period 2019-2028).</p><p>Two of the central commitments in the Action Plan on SAC were the development of quality standards and introduction of a quality assurance system. Initial Regulations for SAC were introduced in 2019, to enable SAC services to register with Tusla and take part in the National Childcare Scheme. My Department then published National Quality Guidelines for SAC Services in September 2020. The National Quality Guidelines, which describe the features of good quality practice in SAC, are an important resource for the diverse range of services that provide SAC in Ireland today. Key actions over the coming years will include roll-out of training to support implementation of the Guidelines, and the development and introduction of comprehensive regulations for SAC.</p><p><i>First 5 </i>commits to introduce a minimum qualification for all staff working in SAC services, with an appropriate period of time to meet the requirement. Work is currently under way through the Workforce Development Plan to specify an appropriate qualification requirement. Implementation of the Workforce Development Plan over the coming years will involve roll-out of relevant training for staff and services.</p><p>The future development of both SAC and ELC will be shaped by a number of major projects under way at present, including the Workforce Development Plan and development of a new funding model for the sector. In addition to setting minimum qualifications, the Workforce Development Plan is looking at ways to raise the profile of careers in the sector, strengthen CPD, and build a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. The Expert Group on a new funding model is examining mechanisms to ensure that increased State investment delivers for children and families to ensure greater levels of affordability, accessibility, quality and inclusion. Reports on both initiatives are due by the end of the year. </p><p>Other reforms signalled in <i>First 5 </i>and other national strategies may also encompass SAC over the coming years, including development of additional supports in areas of disadvantage, and capital investment under the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

In the normal course of events we would seek a transfer to that Dept. to provide as full an answer to your question as possible, at this time the ongoing fall out from the cyber-attack has greatly impacted those organisations ability to respond to questions. </p>  <p>  You may be aware an Assessment of Need is an assessment carried out by the HSE for children or young people with a disability. The assessment identifies the child's health needs and what health services are needed to meet the child&rsquo;s needs. </p>  <p>  You may already be aware that I secured an additional &euro;61M for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in 2021, bringing the total budget to &euro;878M. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic saw Tusla continue providing a frontline service, the most recent cyber-attack is another obstacle to normal service. Tusla staff continue to provide a service to those most at risk in society.</p>  <p>  There is significant demand for Tusla services, recently published data showed Tusla received in excess of 60,000 Referrals in 2020 and 4,931 referrals in January 2021.  Referrals include those meeting the eligibility criteria for child protection and welfare services, multiple reports of the same concern and referrals not meeting the eligibility criteria for a Tusla services. Such referrals are often redirected to appropriate agencies or additional family supports are considered.</p>  <p>  At the end of January 2021 there were 19,966 cases open to Tusla Social workers of which 16,189(81%) were allocated. Over the last 12 months Tusla has on average had 19% of open cases unallocated. Of the 3,777 unallocated cases 2,263(60%) were &ldquo;active on duty&rdquo;. This means that actions were undertaken by dedicated duty teams or social workers on a duty roster to monitor the case. Tusla has outlined its corporate plan for 2021 &ndash; 2023 a target reduction of 30% in all national waiting lists over the three year period.</p>  <p>   Tusla&rsquo;s published performance indicators have consistently identified five of 17 areas regularly accounting for 60% of unallocated cases. Tusla&rsquo;s response is that any area where unallocated cases rise above 25% of their open cases receive a dedicated response.  Where staff vacancies are identified as contributory cause a bespoke recruitment campaign will be put in place. There will also be a strengthening of family support services, of social workers teams managing referrals and of social work staff specifically dealing with retrospective cases. The area will also be monitored and supported by internal audits and further staff training.</p>  <p>  Tusla has prioritised staff retention and recruitment and has begun to engage with social work graduates to conduct interviews prior to graduation, improving the pool of potential recruits. Tusla have also conducted a conversion of agency staff to Tusla staff which will improve continuity of service. My Department has also established a Social Work Education Group looking to expand the throughput of suitably qualified Social Work graduates.</p></reply>

Where a protection applicant discloses information in relation to their gender identity or sexual orientation, the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department makes every effort to ensure that appropriate accommodation is provided. The newly established resident welfare team in IPAS will also work to assess any additional needs the person may have in the context of their accommodation.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware a new Vulnerability Assessment process is currently being piloted by IPAS. The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for international protection from the beginning of February. This assessment provides an opportunity for members of the LGBTI+ community to disclose information at an early stage, helping to ensure appropriate accommodation and support is provided without delay. </p>  <p>  As vulnerabilities can manifest themselves at any stage of the protection process, applicants will also be able to undergo a Vulnerability Assessment at a later stage if this is desired by the applicant and deemed necessary by IPAS or other reception service providers. This is to help to ensure that any vulnerabilities that may subsequently arise are identified in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  IPAS also liaises with State and NGO support agencies to assist our residents who may need guidance or support. In this regard, LGBT Ireland work with residents in our centres who identify as LGBTI+.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, LGBT Ireland has facilitated a peer support group for LGBTI+ people in the International Protection process. Currently 'Is Rainbow Muid' meet online twice a month and continues to provide vital supports to members of the LGBTI+ community living in our accommodation centres at this time. </p>  <p>  IPAS has commenced a review of a number of its operational policies currently in place for the IPAS accommodation network.  As part of this review, a specific policy with regard to the provision of accommodation services for LGBTI protection applicants will be prepared in consultation with the Department's Equality Unit and relevant LGBTI support groups. </p></reply>

The work of the Committee will help to strengthen the Government&rsquo;s approach to combatting individual and institutional racism and will build on the anti-racism actions included in the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS) and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS). The Committee will also examine international best practice in combatting racism and will benchmark its actions against these standards.</p>  <p>  On 21 April this year, I had the pleasure of publishing the Anti-Racism Committee&rsquo;s Interim Report, which sets out the Committee&rsquo;s initial ideas and plans for developing the National Action Plan Against Racism. The publication of this Action Plan will fulfil a key commitment within the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  On the same day as the publication of the Interim Report, the Committee launched the public consultation phase of its work, which will run for twelve weeks from 21 April until 14 July 2021. During this phase, the Committee will hold a series of facilitated meetings with rights-holders and duty-bearers in order better to understand the nature and different forms of racism that are present in Ireland today. These meetings will address different themes which have identified by the Committee as being of particular concern in the fight against racism. The first meeting took place on 20 May and concerned issues surrounding Access to Justice. The second took place on 25 May and dealt with issues related to the Media and Communications, including new technologies.</p>  <p>  These meetings will also help the Committee in the development of effective countermeasures against racism that will be included in the National Action Plan. During this consultation phase, members of the public will be able to present written submissions for the consideration of the Committee, which will play a significant role in the development of the National Action Plan. An online survey will also be made available shortly. The responses gained from this survey will be statistically analysed and will help the Committee to identify gaps in relation to current anti-racism measures.</p>  <p>  A Consultation Report will be prepared by the facilitators for the consideration of the Committee in July, following the close of the Public Consultation phase. An analytical report on the responses to the online survey will also be prepared for the Committee and will be submitted for their consideration in August.</p>  <p>  In addition to outlining its initial views with regard to developing the National Action Plan, the Interim Report also made three recommendations to the Government. These are as follows:</p>  <p>1.  Remove Ireland&rsquo;s reservation to Article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (ICERD);</p>  <p>2.  Take steps to put in place ethnic equality monitoring across all public services;</p>  <p>3.  Remove all barriers to accessing support for migrant women experiencing gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  With respect to Interim Recommendation One, together with the Minister for Justice, I will seek advice from the Attorney General to consider whether the removal of the reservation is now appropriate and timely and, if so, we will establish the steps that would be needed to remove it and advise a future meeting of the Government accordingly.</p>  <p>  With respect to Interim Recommendation Two, I have begun work within the framework of the existing Equality Budgeting initiative being progressed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department and linking with the Equality Data initiative being led by the Central Statistics Office to bring forward an interdepartmental initiative on Ethnic Equality Monitoring.</p>  <p>  With respect to Interim Recommendation Three, I will work with the Minister for Justice towards the following objectives: </p>  <p>  - developing referral pathways that will include the designation of appropriate non-governmental organisations to act as intermediaries between migrant women who are victims of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence or abuse and relevant authorities, including the Garda&iacute;, the HSE, and Tusla; </p>  <p>  - ascertaining whether changes should be made to the level of evidence required to support an application for a change in immigration status by a victim of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence or abuse with a view to strengthening protections available to them;</p>  <p>  - running an information and communication campaign to ensure all migrant women, including holders of Stamp 3 permits, are aware of the range of State services, including welfare supports and emergency refuge, available for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence which they can freely access.</p>  <p>  The drafting process of the National Action Plan will begin in the Autumn, and it is anticipated that the final draft will be submitted to Government before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Additional supports for parents were made available through the 'Preschool at Home' website.  Particular attention was given to supporting children with additional needs who avail of supports through the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM).   </p>  <p>  The transition to primary school can be an anxious time for parents, but I can assure parents that ECCE providers and primary schools are working together to ensure that this years Junior Infants intake is not adversely effected by the loss of two months of ECCE provision earlier this year.</p></reply>

It is my intention that this will allow us to improve the quality of the accommodation and services offered to applicants and to move away from reliance on temporary based accommodation and to ensure that the Department has adequate capacity and can respond flexibly to increases in demand for accommodation as they arise.  <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Expenditure in 2020  &euro; millions</th>       <th>Expenditure January to April 2021        &euro; millions</th>       <th>Estimated expenditure in 2021&euro; millions</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>1.10</td>       <td>0.39</td>       <td>1.18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>0.76</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>5.15</td>       <td>1.97</td>       <td>5.90</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>0.72</td>       <td>0.15</td>       <td>0.15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>13.81</td>       <td>3.20</td>       <td>9.60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>4.17</td>       <td>1.89</td>       <td>5.66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>2.54</td>       <td>0.13</td>       <td>0.40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>0.48</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>0.96</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>1.40</td>       <td>0.50</td>       <td>1.50</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>0.03</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>2.23</td>       <td>0.81</td>       <td>2.42</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>6.18</td>       <td>1.83</td>       <td>5.47</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>1.51</td>       <td>0.26</td>       <td>0.77</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>1.38</td>       <td>0.50</td>       <td>1.49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>0.44</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>3.09</td>       <td>0.93</td>       <td>2.78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>5.96</td>       <td>2.36</td>       <td>7.09</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total *</td>       <td>51.90</td>       <td>14.91</td>       <td>44.42</td>    </tr> </table> * All figures are rounded and therefore total figures are not exact total of individual figures</p></reply>

It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of persons with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide co-ordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson, Mr Fergus Finlay. Currently the group is monitoring the CES Phase Two Action Plan which covers the period 2019 &ndash; 2021. Development of a final Action Plan for the period 2022 &ndash; 2024 will soon take place. </p>  <p>  As part of the monitoring by the Implementation Group, the Independent Chair produces an annual report on progress. In addition, the National Disability Authority produces an annual independent assessment of progress of the CES. </p>  <p>  Each Department is responsible for delivering and implementing the actions assigned to it and for reporting on those the CES Implementation Group. </p>  <p>  Key areas of recent progress under the strategy include the ongoing implementation of specific recommendations arising from the Make Work Pay Report, the production of an online training programme to support employers in becoming &ldquo;disability confident and the production by the Public Appointment Service of a Guide to Promoting Inclusive Employment. In addition CES monitoring has highlighted reported increases in the participation by students with physical or mobility disabilities in higher education, the increased uptake in mainstream education and training options among young people with disabilities and the ongoing provision by HSE Mental Health teams of Individual Placements and Support (IPS) to individuals. </p>  <p>  My own Department has a coordination function and provides secretariat to the Implementation Group. In addition, my Department has responsibility for a number of specific actions under the CES. Initiatives progressed by Department under the current CES Action Plan include the funding and establishment of a disability information service for employers run by the Open Doors Initiative. This service &lsquo;Employers for Change: A Disability Information Service&rsquo; provides expert peer source of advice and information on employing staff with disabilities, with a view to enhancing the confidence and competence of individual employers to employ, manage and retain staff with disabilities. </p></reply>

Over &euro;2.2 million has been made available for the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme this year. These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through their local Education and Training Boards (ETBs). Each year, in the region of 1,400 local youth clubs or groups are eligible to apply under the scheme. The Scheme is intended to support the operation of volunteer-led youth projects.</p>  <p>  Any increase in funding for the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme would be dependent on an increase in youth funding in Budget 2022.

However, it should be noted that the current IPAS operational policy for any international protection applicant, including health care workers returning to IPAS accommodation, is that they must complete 14 days isolation at a dedicated IPAS quarantine facility.   This policy was put in place by IPAS following consultations with the HSE last year and has not changed since then.  I am advised that officials from IPAS are meeting with the HSE and public health officials this week to review the policy.  Should HSE and public health officials advise that the policy should now be amended for any particular group, or is no longer required at all, IPAS will review the policy accordingly.  </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, IPAS has made every effort to retain accommodation for residents who chose to avail of the HSE temporary accommodation scheme or who decided to move to other temporary accommodation during the pandemic.  However, it has not been possible in every case to retain the original accommodation.  For instance, where the accommodation premises is no longer retained under contract with my Department or where a centre has been re-profiled in terms of its room makeup to meet changing demands, the accommodation may no longer be available. </p>  <p>  Another issue that has arisen is that IPAS has not always been made aware that a resident who left their IPAS accommodation centre was working in the healthcare sector and left to take up accommodation in temporary HSE accommodation.  In such cases, the resident&rsquo;s original accommodation may not have been retained and it will be necessary for the healthcare worker to re-apply for IPAS accommodation. </p>  <p>  IPAS will endeavour to ensure that alternative like-for-like accommodation is provided as close as possible to their previous accommodation.  </p></reply>

This scheme will include a restorative recognition payment and a form of enhanced medical card. </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Group (IDG) has been set up to develop detailed proposals for the Restorative Recognition Scheme, which must then be brought to Government for approval. While the IDG must take account of the specific recommendations made by the Commission, its considerations are not limited to those recommendations.  The work of the IDG is underpinned by a human rights focus and informed by consultation with survivors.</p>  <p>  To support and inform the work of the IDG, a public consultation process took place during March and April. The input from survivors to that consultation is invaluable in order to develop a scheme that will have their needs at its core. I was delighted with the strong response to the consultation process with approximately 450 written submissions received and 17 online meetings held.  </p>  <p>  The work of the IDG is ongoing and, so, the specific details of the Restorative Recognition Scheme are not yet decided.  I am aware that the IDG are working extremely hard to ensure that they deliver their report to me very soon. On receipt of this, I will submit recommendations to Government for a decision on the Scheme.  The development of this scheme, and the work being undertaken on all aspects of the Government's response to the Commission's Final Report, is a priority for me. </p></reply>

Advancing the implementation of the UNCRPD is an ongoing priority. Our approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation, moving forward each year on key reforms.  </p>  <p>  The obligations arising from the Convention will be met over time, with initial priority given to meeting legislative commitments. For example, my Department is responsible for the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which is an important step towards full implementation of the UNCRPD. </p>  <p>  In addition, the UNCRPD requires State parties actively to involve people with disabilities in policy development.  In order to progress this aspect of the UNCRPD, my Department has funded the development of a Participation and Consultation Network to build capacity within the disability community so that people with disabilities and their representative organisations can participate fully in policy development.  The Network was formed in late 2020. One of the Network&rsquo;s first tasks has been to bring the voices of people with disabilities into consultations on Ireland&rsquo;s first State Report to the UN on our progress in implementing the UNCRPD.  This Network is an important initiative that will help us to realise both the spirit and the substance of the UNCRPD here in Ireland. It will provide a platform for people with disabilities to become actively involved in issues that affect their lives. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to establishing a UNCRPD Implementation Plan. This Plan will coordinate and monitor progress on implementing the UNCRPD across Government departments. Work on this Plan is at an early stage. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently responsible for coordinating the two significant whole of Government strategies that currently exist in the area of Disability, namely the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES). These are the key frameworks for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland and support effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the UNCRPD.  </p>  <p>  The UNCRPD operates in a similar manner to other UN Human Rights treaties.  The State is required to prepare a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Convention in Ireland and this will be followed by a public appearance before the CRPD Committee in Geneva.</p>  <p>  Ireland is preparing its first State Report. My Department is responsible for preparing the Report, in consultation with other Departments and Agencies who have responsibility for implementing the Convention. The Report will set out how Ireland is implementing the Convention. It will describe progress in a number of areas and acknowledge where further action is required for Ireland to comply fully with the Convention.  </p>  <p>  Ms Anne Rabbitte T.D, Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, published the draft State Report in December 2020 and a public consultation process has recently concluded.  The Report, incorporating the information obtained during the public consultation process, will be brought to Government for approval in advance of its formal submission to the Committee by Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva later this year.  </p>  <p>  Following the submission of the State Report, Ireland will then take part in an appearance with the UN Committee.  The information gathered at this appearance will inform the Committee's report on how Ireland is implementing the UNCRPD and I would expect their report to include recommendations on areas for improvements.  There is no indication at this time on a likely date for that appearance.</p></reply>

Estimates are derived using a range of administrative and survey data sources. The total eligible cohort is derived from birth data provided by the Central Statistics Office. Overall uptake is derived through the examination of trends in uptake since the introduction of the programme, data from Growing Up in Ireland, and data from the Pupil Online Database held by the Department of Education. Since the extension of the ECCE Programme in 2016, data on school starting age has also been used.  My Department also accesses data on the number of children in the ECCE-eligible cohort at electoral division level, which provides a robust indication of demand for ECCE places at a local level.</p>  <p>  While the ECCE Programme has almost universal uptake, there is significantly more variation in the level of demand for other types Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC).  The variation in demand is due to a number of reasons including parental preferences for different types of ELC/SAC, changes to the suite of family leave entitlements, whether and the extent to which parents are working or participating in training or study. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the National Childcare Scheme, where eligibility for a universal subsidy is determined by the child's age and eligibility for a targeted subsidy determine by family composition and income, greatly simplifies the process of estimating current uptake of services of different types. My Department also participates in the ESRI SWITCH research programme which involves analysis and reporting on a range of relevant issues including parental preferences and labour force participation rates.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, Pobal, on behalf of my Department undertakes an annual survey of providers. Among the data gathered through this survey is information on the number of children enrolled and those on waiting lists, as well as information on vacant places in ELC and SAC services</p>  <p>  In the context of Covid-19, officials my Department undertook a programme of research in response to the closures and phased reopening of the sector in 2020. Among this research programme was two waves of a household survey.  An additional wave of this survey is currently being undertaken to further estimate the Covid-19 impact on demand currently, and into the coming programme year.</p>  <p>  First 5: A Whole-of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families seeks to build on existing efforts.  Identified among the actions in First 5 is a commitment to strengthen capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand for ELC and SAC by undertaking a regular national needs assessment.  In addition, officials in my Department are planning research on the ELC/SAC needs of parents who work atypical hours or live in rural communities.</p></reply>

The Group&rsquo;s Draft Guiding Principles to underpin a new funding model recognise the importance of the workforce in delivering quality services. The Draft Guiding Principles refer to the recruitment and retention of staff with the necessary qualifications; ongoing staff training and development; fair pay and working conditions; and a workforce which feels valued and is motivated to deliver the best possible service to children.

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy.</p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p>  <p>  There are also some important developments currently under way.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I began a short process to examine the possibility of regulating the pay and conditions of employment of practitioners in early learning and childcare, and to examine the suitability of establishing a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) for the sector, in line with the Programme for Government commitment. On foot of this process, the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail has written to the Labour Court, who are currently examining whether to establish a JLC. If established, a JLC could lead to an Employment Regulation Order, which would establish binding rates of pay and conditions for the sector.</p>  <p>  Work is also progressing on a new funding model. The recommendations of a dedicated Expert Group are due later in 2021 and will be central to addressing both affordability and quality issues. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Draft Guiding Principles to underpin a new funding model recognise the importance of the workforce in delivering quality services. </p>  <p>  Finally, work on the Workforce Development Plan continues, with final outputs expected by the end of the year. This is expected to include plans for making careers in early learning and childcare more attractive.</p></reply>

However, as I am sure you will appreciate, the configuration of each centre and the room makeup is constantly changing as new applicants are placed in accommodation, people with a protection status or permission to remain move to accommodation in the community and transfers take place between accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  Given the scope of this exercise, IPAS now collates these figures on a quarterly basis. I can inform the Deputy that on 31 March 2021 the number of unrelated single residents sharing a room in IPAS accommodation was 1,892.  This comprises 1,171 residents in a room assigned to 2 people and 721 residents in a room assigned to 3 people.  It should be noted that some of these 2 and 3 person rooms may not be fully occupied at any given time for a variety of operational reasons.   In line with IPAS policy, there are no more than 3 unrelated single persons sharing a room with other people.</p>  <p>  My Department has commenced work on a Request for Tender to procure additional accommodation for single people and families seeking international protection. This tender process will focus on the provision of own-door accommodation and facilities to allow for independent living (access to cooking and laundry facilities and communal family areas outside bedrooms). It is my intention that this will allow us to improve the quality of the accommodation and services offered to applicants and to move away from reliance on temporary based accommodation and to ensure that the Department has adequate capacity and can respond flexibly to increases in demand for accommodation as they arise.  It is also intended to reduce the number of single people sharing rooms with non-family members.</p></reply>

I have secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. Funding for the energy poverty retrofit schemes has also increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,800 homes on the scheme work programme. This includes homes that: are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting initial survey. The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p>  <p>  The SEAI has advised me that the average wait times should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;112.5 million will be spent on expanding other existing SEAI residential and community grant schemes and introducing new initiatives.

These are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The SEAI residential retrofit schemes offer partial grants for individuals who can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy efficiency improvements for people at risk of energy poverty. Since 2000, around 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.    Building Regulations have been progressively strengthened and new buildings must now meet very high energy performance standards to limit the use of fossil fuel energy and related CO2 emissions. There are options to meet this requirement for new build homes by including renewable technologies including heat pumps and/or solar PV. However, grants are not targeted at meeting compliance requirements of these Regulations. </p>  <p>  Grant funding to improve energy performance is available for older homes built before 2006 and in the case of renewable energy measures for homes built before 2011 because these homes were not required to meet the improved Building Regulations. It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

It will also help Ireland to move towards our 70% renewable electricity target by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers. </p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions. Most recently, my Department commissioned an independent report incorporating international industry expertise to examine the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector and the report from the International Expert Commission was published in October 2018. It found that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this piece of critical electricity infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I have decided to commission a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid. Terms of reference for this study were published on my Department's website on 21 April. On 7 May, my Department initiated a  procurement process using the procurement frameworks administered by the Office of Government Procurement to appoint an expert to undertake the review.</p></reply>

On expiry, the licence holder can then exchange their licence for an Irish licence.</p>  <p>  The exception to this rule is where the licence issued by the other Member State was itself issued in exchange for a licence from a state that is not a Member State, or a state that Ireland does not have a licence exchange agreement with. The Road Traffic (Recognition of Foreign Driving Licences) Order 2007 (SI 527 of 2007) refers.</p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchangeable licence, they are required to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence.

A particular emphasis was placed on improving connectivity along the Belfast-Dublin-Cork corridor.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Irish Government set out its intention to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.</p>  <p>  My Department is progressing this review and is engaging extensively with relevant stakeholders.  Department officials have met with representatives from relevant airports as well as representatives from the Department for the Economy (NI). As reserved powers for civil aviation rests in Westminster, they also met with representatives from the Department for Transport (UK).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, air services previously operated on both of these routes. The Belfast to Cork route was operated on a commercial basis whereas the Derry to Dublin route was supported by a PSO, which was funded by the Irish Government. Services ceased on both routes in 2011. In 2010, a Value for Money Review (VfM) undertaken by my Department recommended the ceasing of support for the Derry PSO. Passenger numbers on route had been falling consistently since 2006, with PSO passengers accounting for only 5% of the overall passenger numbers at City of Derry Airport in the final 3 years of the PSO. Falling demand, coupled with the option to avail of the PSO flight from Donegal to Dublin, undermined the argument for continuing to support the Derry PSO.</p>  <p>  In consideration of potential supports for renewing services, the Department will take account of previous history, prospective demand, likely costs and long-term sustainability goals, having regard to the recently launched all-island Strategic Rail Review and plans for improved road connectivity, particularly the A5, between Derry and Dublin.</p>  <p>  While I expect the review to be finalised shortly, I&rsquo;m conscious that Covid-19 has brought significant upheaval to the aviation market and demand for air services continue to be suppressed as a consequence of the ongoing threat to public health.  In this context, it may be difficult to fully assess options and reach appropriate conclusions until the market stabilises.</p>  <p>  This review, as well as the delivery of identified infrastructure projects to achieve greater cross border connectivity, has been on the agenda of all transport sector meetings of the North South Ministerial Council and is part of the work programme led by the Department of the Taoiseach. I will continue to engage on progress related to the review, as appropriate, with the Department of the Economy (NI), the Department for Transport (UK), and the Department of An Taoiseach.</p></reply>

This will help significantly to tackle the backlog.</p>  <p>  The RSA has been working to deliver an online service, with a pilot online test already underway for trucks and buses. This pilot service has now been extended to include a limited number of car and motorbike tests.  </p>  <p>  The new offering online will see 4,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles per month. Tests are available on a &lsquo;first come, first served&rsquo; basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. Once the online service is established, all customers will be able to opt to do the test online.</p>  <p>  From the start, it has been clear that the first priority is public safety. We want to provide services, and we know people are looking for services, but we will provide them only to the limit possible while preserving public health.</p></reply>

Globally, aviation is experiencing its most challenging crisis in its history. In Europe there were 5 million flights in 2020 as against 11 million in the previous year. Restrictions on international travel this year have further suppressed passenger numbers, which are down as low as 3% of normal volumes in Ireland&rsquo;s State airports.</p>  <p>  The continuing crisis in aviation internationally is increasing the pressure on all firms in the industry internationally. All the major airlines have variously issued capital, raised further borrowings drawn on Government supports and taken measures to reduce their cost base. The two main Irish airlines entered the crisis with exceptionally strong balance sheets and they both remain well capitalised at corporate group level.</p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, Government has provided a significant level of general supports to the economy, with at least &euro;300 million provided to the aviation sector alone through wage supports, business grants, tax and rates alleviations. The bulk of this support is in the form of wage subsidies, which were designed to maintain the link between employers and their workers. In addition to these broad supports, my Department secured almost &euro;80 million in Exchequer funds to help passenger airports navigate this crisis in 2021. Liquidity support from ISIF has also been made available to large aviation enterprises. </p>  <p>  A recent Report from the Central Bank on COVID-19 and the Public Finances in Ireland* outlined that the fiscal support package introduced in Ireland was large in a euro area context, with the increase in primary (non-interest) government spending in Ireland the second highest in the euro area in the first three quarters of last year. The report found that fiscal measures introduced have mitigated the impact of the pandemic on households, firms and the broader economy.</p>  <p>  This supports the Government&rsquo;s policy of providing horizontal financial supports with a view to mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the broader economy. Government is confident that this strategy will facilitate a speedy recovery of all sectors, including aviation, as soon as restrictions are lifted.</p>  <p>  * www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/publications/economic-letters/vol-2021-no-3-covid-19-and-the-public-finances-in-ireland-(conefrey-hickey-and-mcinerney).pdf?sfvrsn=11 </p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the Love 30 campaign across Europe is focused on cities and other urban areas implementing such limits and not on national legislation.  The Minister emphasized the Government's sympathy with this campaign, while at the same time acknowledging that there needs to be a considerable amount of consultation as part of this process.</p>  <p>  In particular, Minister Ryan pointed out that the Programme for Government commits to a review of speed limits, and committed to a review of international best practice to be conducted by the Department with a view to possibly reducing the default 50km/h limit to a 30km/h default.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to cover.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to improving the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups. The <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>sets out 66 actions in this regard across several policy areas, including my Department, with 95% due to be completed by the end of 2021. The Sub-Group of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment, which is implementing this Action Plan, was established by Government to oversee insurance reform implementation. I strongly believe the cross-departmental approach in the <i>Action Plan</i>provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance and will build and expand upon previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.</p><p>At its most recent meeting in March, the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which oversees the implementation of the <i>Action Plan</i>, reflected upon the considerable progress made in the first three months of this year. Achievements include:</p><p>- The creation of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance;</p><p>- The adoption of new Personal Injuries Guidelines, which came into force on 24 April;</p><p>- A recent public consultation on proposals to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.</p><p>Upcoming priorities include: strengthening the laws on perjury, expanding the National Claims Information Database so that it publishes its first report on employer and public liability insurance, and examining the Central Bank&rsquo;s final report on differential pricing so that the Government can respond accordingly.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to engage extensively on this matter and monitor developments in the sector as the Government drives forward the insurance reform agenda.

I am advised by Revenue that the debt warehousing scheme already provides for the warehousing of income tax liabilities for 2020 and, where appropriate, 2021, for taxpayers who meet the eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  The liabilities that may be warehoused under this scheme are the balance of self-assessed income tax, PRSI and USC for 2019 and preliminary tax, PRSI and USC for 2020, which were due to be paid on or before 31 October 2020, or 10 December 2020 where the individual filed electronically through ROS; and, in certain circumstances, the balance of self-assessed income tax, PRSI and USC for 2020 and preliminary tax, PRSI and USC for 2021, which are due to be paid on or before 31 October 2021 or 17 November2021, if filed electronically.</p>  <p>  To qualify for warehousing, an individual must declare that s/he estimates her/his total income for 2020 or 2021, as appropriate, will be at least 25% lower than her/his total income for 2019, due to the impact of Covid-19 restrictions.  If the individual was not a self-assessed taxpayer in 2019, s/he will be eligible for warehousing if, as a result of the effect on her/his income of Covid-19 restrictions, s/he is unable to pay her/his income tax liabilities in 2020 or 2021. Where the relevant condition is satisfied, any self-assessed taxpayer is eligible for income tax warehousing, regardless of what sector s/he operates in.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Covid-19 income tax&rdquo; will be subject to 0% interest for a period of twelve months and 3% interest per annum thereafter until the liability is paid in full. Where an individual is eligible for warehousing of the balance of 2020 income tax, PRSI and USC and preliminary income tax, PRSI and USC for 2021, s/he can avail of 0% interest on the warehoused amounts for an additional twelve months.</p>  <p>  To avail of the 0% and reduced 3% interest rates, the individual must comply with her/his other tax obligations and, prior to the expiration of the zero-interest period, must enter into a payment plan with Revenue to pay the warehoused debt.  The benefit of the warehouse scheme is conditional on the individual quantifying her/his tax debt through submission of all outstanding returns. If an individual fails to meet the conditions for debt warehousing &ndash; for example, if s/he fails to file a return or defaults on other taxes - the benefit of the 0% and 3 % interest rates will no longer apply and interest at a rate of 8% per annum will be re-imposed.</p>  <p>  An information booklet giving full details of this scheme is available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue adopts a pragmatic approach to businesses with genuine payment difficulties and has advised me that any business or tax agent who is struggling to meet their obligations should contact the relevant Revenue Branch Manager (via myEnquiries) to discuss the matter.</p></reply>

Once triggered, the 10% rate will also apply to any other residential properties acquired in that 12 month period i.e. the other 9 in this example.</p><p>This 10% rate is intended to provide a significant disincentive to the multiple purchase of residential units in the Irish property market and I believe when combined with longer term planning permission changes should result in a greater availability of houses for those wishing to purchase a family home for owner occupier purposes.</p><p>You should note that acquisitions by Local Authorities and approved housing bodies are already exempt from stamp duty, and this exemption will continue to apply as regards this new higher rate. </p><p>I have also provided a specific exemption from this higher stamp duty rate for the multiple purchase of apartments. The rationale for this is that a key objective of this proposal is to achieve a balance between addressing the issue of multiple purchases by institutional investors, whilst at the same time ensuring the supply of financing is not undermined, particularly for the construction of new apartment developments.</p><p>Without this exemption, it is felt that there would be a significant risk that developers would exit from the apartment building market as such projects would no longer be viable, and, if that were to happen, an important element of our housing strategy would be lost.</p><p>It is intended that the changes provided for in the Financial Resolution will be provided for in formal legislation in the next couple of months.</p></reply>

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

It is important that they continue to do so given the current housing crisis. </p>  <p>  ISIF&rsquo;s investment in the residential development sector is aimed at unlocking the supply of new homes across all tenures.  ISIF&rsquo;s single largest investment to date has been in Activate Capital, which lends to Irish homebuilders undertaking new construction projects aimed, overwhelmingly, at the owner occupier market.  ISIF has also supported new construction that is adding to the stock of rental accommodation in our major urban centres in line with market demand.   To date, ISIF has directly committed &euro;937 million which is supporting the supply of 15,000 new homes across 100 construction sites nationwide, which includes 2,500 new rental properties.  </p>  <p>  ISIF, as part of a wider suite of Government measures, is therefore making an important contribution to increased housing supply which is vital to addressing many of the challenges in Ireland&rsquo;s residential property market.</p>  <p>  HBFI was established in late 2018 as a Government initiative to address a shortfall of finance available for the construction of residential housing. HBFI was designed to increase access to residential development finance generally and in particular to projects that had not been the current focus of traditional or alternative lenders at that time. It was also designed to be able to adapt to changing conditions in the financing market. </p>  <p>  Accordingly following the outbreak of Covid-19, HBFI widened its remit on a temporary basis to allow it to provide finance for larger prime residential projects that were experiencing difficulties in accessing financing. In May 2020, HBFI established a &euro;300 million temporary step-in fund which is known as their &ldquo;Momentum Fund&rdquo;. This was to help ensure that supply was not interrupted due to a tightening of financing markets.   </p>  <p>  Again reacting to changing market conditions, HBFI brought other additional products to the market including a small development product specifically for smaller projects of between 5 and 10 units and an apartment product.</p>  <p>  HBFI does not fund institutional investment, HBFI provides development finance to builders and developers to enable construction of residential property. HBFI has provided funding across a range of development sizes including for the construction of homes for private rental. HBFI funding has enabled construction to proceed on these projects to deliver much needed supply and not to displace the construction of residential homes for sale.</p>  <p>  Since inception, HBFI has approved funding to house builders to support the delivery of up to 2,400 homes across 17 counties. Of these, 5 developments (out of 52 approved) are subject to forward purchase PRS sales and represents 916 units approved of which 851 (93%) are apartments and 65 are houses. </p>  <p>  HBFI has &euro;730m of funding available for residential development, with an ability to raise a further &euro;750m if required.  It is important to recognise that the temporary funding of large-scale developments has not, and will not, impact on HBFI's ability to fund small and medium sized developments. These smaller developments are the core of HBFI&rsquo;s business and will continue to remain so.</p></reply>

In common with my predecessors as Minister for Finance, I have regular engagement with the bodies referenced, in particular with the Central Bank, on a wide range of issues.  My officials are currently reviewing the records of these regular meetings to identify if the IIP was discussed in any of these meetings.  However as the request covers a significant time period and the tenure of two Ministers, this exercise is expected to take a some time. In light of this, I regret to advise that it was not possible to provide the information sought in the time available to respond to this Parliamentary Question and therefore I will make arrangements to provide the information to the Deputy in line with Standing Order 42A.</p>  <p>   However with regard to the subject matter of the Deputy&rsquo;s query, I can advise that in late 2013 the former Minister for Finance, in conjunction with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, announced the addition of REIT investments to the 5 investment options already in place under the Immigrant Investor Programme.  This was subject to conditions placed on the minimum level of the investment and withdrawal of funds, to ensure alignment with the overall purpose of the programme.</p>  <p>  As stated, the Immigrant Investor Programme is a matter for the Department of Justice, therefore any reviews or impact assessments of the programme will be undertaken by that Department.

In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  </p><p>The terms of the Scheme set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:  </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg suchthat the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; </p><p>- be without one or both legs; </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th</sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p><p>On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p><p>In order to allow for the PMC assessments and appeals to recommence I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation which, following the approval of the Finance Act 2020, allowed assessments to recommence.  Separately, however, the ability to hold assessments may be impacted on by, among other things, the public health restrictions in place and the role of the HSE Medical Officers in the roll out of the COVID vaccination programme.</p><p>Following approval of the Finance Act 2020, a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities and the criteria for qualification for the Scheme, will be conducted this year. On foot of that review new proposals will be brought forward for consideration.</p></reply>

The scheme provides income or corporation tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred in refurbishing/converting qualifying buildings which are located within pre-determined 'Special Regeneration Areas'.  </p>  <p>  The Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) provided tax relief by way of an income tax credit on repair, renovation or improvement works on principal private residences or rental properties carried out by tax compliant contractors. It was introduced in 2014 at a time when there was considerable loss of employment within the construction sector, with the aim of addressing this market failure by stimulating increased activity in the sector. The incentive expired on 31 December 2018 following a review of the scheme.  The review found that in the context of the current housing supply shortage, and the need at that time to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there was a risk that the scheme could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The review concluded that the continuation of the scheme could give rise to displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations and would create a high opportunity cost of labour which was not present at the inception of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Also, in 2019, in the context of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) deliberations, my department examined the concept of a tax incentive along the lines of the HRI for domestic retrofit projects. The relevant TSG paper was published with the Budget 2020 documentation. It indicated that there could be a duplication of supports with the direct Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) grant system already in place and that a scheme such as this could conflict with the need to increase overall housing supply.  </p>  <p>  The paper observed that: </p>  <p>  - in terms of current direct expenditure measures in the energy efficiency sector, the Government continues to make grants available to householders who wish to improve the energy efficiency of their home through the SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Homes (BEH) and Deep retrofit Grant programme;  </p>  <p>  - research undertaken by the ESRI into householder preferences regarding retrofit subsidy schemes found that households strongly prefer cash payment subsidies (i.e. up-front discounts or cash back post works) versus other indirect methods of financial support such as tax credits); and </p>  <p>  - from an equity perspective, tax expenditure measures can be regressive by nature, given that only those who pay taxes qualify, and those with greatest income benefit the most. As such, a tax incentive measure as proposed may be of little benefit to certain groups who are most likely to suffer from energy poverty, for example the elderly or those on limited incomes.</p>  <p>  More generally, proposals for tax expenditure measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p></reply>

However, before introducing such a tax it is of course important to have  a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long term vacant dwellings, and the reasons why they are vacant.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, in 2018 I commissioned a study on the potential of a vacant residential property tax to meet the objective of increasing the supply of homes. The resulting report presented a detailedevidence-based assessment of vacancy rates in areas in which the demand for housing is most acute.   The report did not recommend the introduction of a residential vacant property tax as it considered it would not be an effective response to deal with the housing challenges. The very low vacancy rates in the areas of greatest demand for housing, particularly in terms of medium term vacancy, indicated that the potential for a vacant property tax to increase housing supply was very limited and could represent a distraction from the need to significantly accelerate the building of new social housing, affordable housing and the facilitation of private sector supply.  In their report Indecon stated that while such a tax would be likely to generate significant media and public attention and may be seen as part of an effective response to our housing problems, they did not believe that this would be supported by the evidence in their report. </p>  <p>  The report recommended that the matter be kept under review and this remains the position. </p></reply>

This is with the aim of developing a sustainable Irish agricultural sector that protects the environment and aligns with emerging consumer sentiment, while benefiting farmers and rural communities.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the allocation of &euro;1.5bn in projected carbon tax receipts over the next ten years for this purpose. The first step in meeting this commitment was in Budget 2021 through the allocation of &euro;20m in anticipated additional carbon tax receipts for the creation of pilot environmental programmes. This was supplemented with the continuation of the &euro;3m in funding that was provided for agricultural programmes from carbon tax receipts in 2020, bringing the total funding for carbon tax supported measures in the agricultural sector to &euro;23m in 2021. </p>  <p>  These funds are being used to create an innovative, results-based pilot scheme for farmers who improve the bio-diversity and carbon management of their land, by undertaking specific actions which they report directly based on the results generated from their actions. </p>  <p>  The use of carbon funds in 2021 was detailed in the Budget Day publication "The Use of Carbon Tax Funds 2021" which continues to be available on the budget.gov.ie website. Carbon tax funding in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is allocated to a specific sub-head, B.13, against which progress on spending the allocated funds can be tracked. </p>  <p>  Questions regarding the operational details of the pilot programmes should be directed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine. Regarding the Common Agricultural Programme, it is my understanding that the CAP Strategic Plan is in still in development by the Minister for Agriculture, Food Marine and it is envisaged that a draft plan will be published for a full and thorough public consultation in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

As the scale of investment and works is substantial, the OPW plans to open the site on phased basis, beginning with the gardens of the estate. </p>  <p>  Since the handover, the OPW has recognised that major investment would be required to restore the gardens, which contains an extensive botanical collection of international repute, and the estate to its former glory. The OPW has spent &euro;2,117,138.77 from 2016 to date on major projects associated with the clearance, development and restoration of the gardens, provision of toilets, car parking and conservation of certain outbuildings on site. This initial phase of investment in capital works will conclude in 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition to this budget for works, the OPW has allocated &euro;392,000 annually to Annes Grove for operational expenditure, to cover items such as pay, machinery, general maintenance and operational goods and services.</p>  <p>  The OPW also plans to continue to invest in infrastructure and visitor facilities to support the development and growth of Annes Grove into the future subject to the availability of funding. The OPW was awarded &euro;375,000 in grant funding from the Rural Regeneration Development Fund ( to be matched by &euro;125,000 from the OPW) to develop and bring to planning permission a scheme to refurbish the house, outbuildings and create a world-class visitor experience at Annes Grove to rival the very best existing sites throughout Ireland such as at Altamount or Derrynane. This project is currently ongoing and OPW intends to submit a planning application by the end of the year. </p></reply>

Additional thought will also be required by NGBs if organising events that take place (fully or partially) on public grounds or roads. When planning events NGBs should also seek to engage with other relevant stakeholders such as the Health &amp;amp; Rescue Services, Garda&iacute; and the Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  To assist in planning during the initial return, a set of Guiding Principles have been developed in consultation with the Return to Sport Expert Group. These have been distributed to the relevant NGBs. While Sport Ireland and the Return to Sport Expert Group remains available to provide feedback on the COVID-19 elements of competition protocols it is important to note that NGBs and their affiliates will have responsibility for the organisation, sanctioning and monitoring of the events within their own sports.

The Government continues to keep the situation under review with a view to continuing to reopen sectors, services and activities as the public health situation allows.  The public health advice prepared by the National Public Health Emergency Team is considered as part of the Government&rsquo;s decision-making process.

The intention is to make steady progress with the reopening of society and the economy while avoiding a further wave of disease and re-imposition of restrictions.</p>  <p>  As has been the case at each stage of the easing of restrictions, the set of measures introduced is intended to incrementally re-open the country while minimising the risks of transmission in alignment with risk levels. The Government is cognizant of the impact of any and all restrictions across every sector and fully aware of the challenges individuals and businesses continue to face. </p>  <p>  As we progress with the Recovery and Resilience: The Path Ahead plan, work is continuing on a number of other issues in preparation for the coming months.

It is intended to provide in such regulations that the eligibility threshold will be that the applicant cannot secure a mortgage for 90% of the open market value of the dwelling being made available. Regulations may also require that other savings/assets are taken into account when considering eligibility.</p>  <p>  Limited exceptions are provided to conditions (ii) and (iii), to provide as follows: (a) a person applying had previously purchased/built a dwelling as part of a marriage/relationship that has now ended, and that person does not retain a beneficial interest in the dwelling; (b) a person applying had previously purchased a dwelling, but sold it/became divested of it as part of insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings; and (c) a person applying owns or owned a dwelling, but it is now too small/unsuitable for current household needs. Regulations and/or guidelines may also be made in relation to these exceptions.  </p>  <p>  Regarding Cost Rental, Section 32 of the Bill empowers me, as Minister, to regulate the letting of designated cost rental dwellings. The Minister may prescribe eligibility requirements in respect of tenants and their households, along with the process all landlords must follow when advertising vacant dwellings and entering into tenancies. </p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of funding to purchase an equity share in private dwellings, Section 42 of the Bill provides that the Minister may contribute funds to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the purpose of operating and administering an Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme. It also provides that the  Minister, may agree the terms by which the equity support may be provided in a memorandum of agreement with the SPV covering, inter alia, areas such as purchaser eligibility and financial means, the homes that may be considered eligible under the scheme, and the amount of funding that can be provided.</p>  <p>  Required regulations will be made following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

My Department published the <i>National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy</i>, in 2018, which contains a range of objectives and key actions to be pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock.  The Strategy is underpinned by a number of supports and guidance put in place by my Department to assist in bringing vacant housing stock back into use including:</p><p>- <b>The  Repair and Leasing Scheme </b>which assists private property owners, local authority and Approved Housing Bodies to utilise existing vacant housing stock throughout the country as social housing.  The scheme is targeted at owners of  vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for a rental property.  The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and Lease Scheme has recently been increased by my Department from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000.  This increase allows for greater access  to the scheme for owners of properties that require more extensive repairs.</p><p>- <b>The Buy and Renew Scheme</b>particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased by local authorities, rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners. </p><p>- In December 2018 my Department published the <b>Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings.  </b>Revitalising our main streets through well designed refurbishment of residential units, particularly above shops, could help to rejuvenate smaller town centres and city streets as well as produce more houses. </p><p>Securing improved data and analysis on vacancy allows for more robust monitoring of vacancy at a national level and improved outputs at local level.  To help record levels of vacancy, a website has been developed by Mayo County Council (vacanthomes.ie) on behalf of the local government sector. This provides a central portal for individuals to anonymously log possible vacant properties and alert local authorities who can then follow up with the owners to see whether the house can be re-used quickly.</p><p>To further support this work at local authority level, my Department has secured funding for each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office plays a key role in the co-ordination of this work within each local authority. </p></reply>

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned.  The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern and are being taken very seriously.  It is important that we establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response on the best knowledge and evidence available. In order to better understand the issue, two separate pieces of research are being undertaken, each with a different focus. </p>  <p>  A review of homeless deaths is being undertaken on behalf of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) by Dr Austin O&rsquo;Carroll, the HSE appointed Clinical Lead for Covid-19 and Homelessness in Dublin.  The review, which the DRHE has indicated is due for completion imminently, aims to analyse the data concerning deaths in homeless services for 2020 to identify learning for homeless and health services that could help tailor the provision of care to homeless people. </p>  <p>  A separate feasibility study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. This is due to be completed by the end of 2021.  The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, is reviewing approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts. </p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit into permanent housing solutions and that those with complex health and mental health needs are provided with the supports they need. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in respect of these issues.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs. It commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided. The provision of addiction and mental health supports has featured prominently in meetings of the High Level Homelessness Task Force that I established and in my regular interactions with the Minister for Health. The issue of deaths in homeless services has also been discussed at the Task Force.  </p>  <p>  Engaging with rough sleepers is vital.  This engagement is first and foremost to encourage those rough sleeping to avail of shelter.  But critically, it also allows their health needs to be assessed and provided for. </p></reply>

This process was also informed by extensive engagement between my Department and both Donegal and Mayo County Councils. </p>  <p>  The scheme outlines five remedial options ranging from rebuilding on existing foundations to replacing of external walls. The maximum approved costs per dwelling under the scheme are significant and range from &euro;55,000 to &euro;275,000 depending on the remedial option.  A grant of 90% of the approved costs associated with the necessary remediation works, subject to a maximum for each remedial option, or 90% of the actual cost of the remedial works, whichever is the lesser, is available under the scheme.

As such, the Flemish Decree effectively restricted significantly more than development rights in respect of new housing.  The broad scope of the Flemish Decree was such that it was successfully challenged in the European Court of Justice, which ruled that it was contrary to EU freedoms.</p>  <p>  A working group was established to review and, where necessary, recommend changes to the 2005 Guidelines and this group met on five occasions between May 2017 and January 2019.  During this period, in 2018, the National Planning Framework (the NPF) was published and provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  Work is current underway in preparation of an update of the 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for planning authorities, which were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  I expect to receive an initial draft guidelines document in the coming weeks.  Given the complexity of the issues involved, the need for environmental assessment and both internal and external consultation, I would expect updated guidelines to be available later in 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department communicated to planning authorities (Circular letter PL 2/2017) on 31 May 2017, advising that the existing 2005 Guidelines remain in place until advised otherwise by the Department and this remains valid.</p></reply>

The site in question, which stretches from the former Carlton Cinema on O&rsquo;Connell Street to Moore Street, has suffered decades of dereliction and decay with the market traders on Moore Street now facing an existential crisis with their future on the street.  </p><p>Hammerson has appointed a highly qualified and experienced team of international heritage and architectural experts to draw up the regeneration proposals which, as presented, envisage the retention of a significantly enlarged portfolio of pre-1916 fabric and buildings by comparison to anything previously envisaged.  The new plans take account of the unique character and history of the area and include a suite of measures to acknowledge, respect and record the seismic events that occurred in and around Moore Street during Easter Week 1916 and the people who were involved. </p><p>I am aware that the company  has made the same presentation, which also envisages the creation of up to 8,600 jobs, along with the delivery of significant numbers of new residential units, to the Moore Street Advisory Group (MSAG). The MSAG was established to liaise with stakeholders, including 1916 Relatives, street traders and Hammerson itself, to broker agreed solutions for the renewal of the area that would be sympathetic to its culture, history and traditions.</p><p>The MSAG has recently presented its final report to Minister O&rsquo;Brien and I, putting forward a number of important recommendations on how the street and its market could be rejuvenated and how the national monument buildings at Nos. 14 &ndash; 17 could be presented to the public as a 1916 Commemorative Centre. The Deputy&rsquo;s own party was formally represented on the MSAG by Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh. </p><p>The report makes it clear that the MSAG is supportive of the Hammerson plan &lsquo;<i>as it now stands&rsquo; </i>on the basis that it &lsquo;<b><i>preserves the urban heritage whilst simultaneously attempting to consider the need for modernisation in a culturally and historically sensitive manner&rsquo;</i></b>. The report also finds that Hammerson&rsquo;s current proposals &lsquo;adequately, properly and respectfully acknowledge the role of the area during the 1916 Rising&rsquo;. I am pleased that Hammerson has engaged constructively with the MSAG and that it has taken the views of the Advisory Group on board in formulating the new plans. </p><p>The MSAG has also given a clear recommendation for work on the State owned National Monument buildings to recommence as soon as is possible.  Officials from my Department are liaising with the Office of Public Works in this regard and will be considering the report of the Irish Heritage Trust, which was tasked on behalf of the MSAG by my Department,  with coming up with recommendations, in that context. </p><p>The report of the MSAG has been noted by Cabinet. </p></reply>

The Mission network works to diversify our markets, to increase trade and investment with Ireland, to enable Irish companies to better take advantage of new opportunities, and to support Irish businesses in markets, by providing contacts and information.</p>  <p>  Embassies and Consulates General play a crucial role in advancing Ireland&rsquo;s international trade as part of Team Ireland overseas. They provide support for Ireland&rsquo;s State Agencies, including through supporting their strategic objectives and activities in overseas markets. The role of the Mission network in supporting the promotion of exports is particularly pertinent in markets with limited or no State Agency presence, such as in the case of the Embassy referenced. </p>  <p>  Officers based at all Missions continuously engage in economic and public diplomacy to promote Irish exports and to advance Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity and raise awareness of Ireland as a place to live, study, work, visit and do business.</p>  <p>  In June 2018, the Government launched the Global Ireland initiative, which aims to double the impact and scope of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025.  Global Ireland's targets include enhanced global engagement, the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy network and strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s State Agency presence overseas.  Each of these measures will increase Ireland&rsquo;s international visibility, facilitate market diversification and intensification, and deepen bilateral relations in support of the Government&rsquo;s economic and political objectives, including in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The trade and economic activity of Missions will be particularly important in the post-Brexit context and in contributing to national prosperity as we, and the world, recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  While trade and economic promotion activity is a key priority for overseas Missions, it is obviously, and should not be, the only priority. The Mission network addresses a range of other priority engagements, including:</p>  <p>  - to strengthen political, social and cultural relationships with countries of accreditation;</p>  <p>  - to contribute to the promotion of global peace and security, as well as help us to promote our values through, where appropriate, supporting peace building, strengthening conflict prevention accountability for those who violate international human rights or humanitarian law and contributing to prosperity and sustainable development;</p>  <p>  - to deepen our engagement with international partners, particularly through multilateral organisations including the United Nations;</p>  <p>  - to support and assist Irish citizens and our diaspora abroad, and</p>  <p>  - to engage in public diplomacy related to all the above priorities.</p></reply>

At present, Ireland&rsquo;s scale of assessment is 0.371% of the overall UN Budget.  In 2020, Ireland paid just over &euro;30 million in contributions to the UN budget, which includes funding to the UN Regular Budget, UN Peacekeeping Missions and UN Tribunals. </p><p>The most recent report from the Secretary General of the United Nations on the financial situation of the United Nations was published in May 2021 (UN documents reference A/75/387/Add.1). In this report, Ireland is listed as one of fifty countries that have paid all assessments that were due and payable at the time of reporting. The report indicates that by the end of 2020, a total of 144 Member States had paid their regular budget assessments in full. As at 31 December 2020, 47 Member States had paid all peacekeeping assessments due and payable.</p><p>Article 19 of the UN Charter includes a facility for the loss of voting rights for countries who fall into arrears in the payments of financial contributions to the United Nations.  A Member State is considered to have fallen into arrears when it has not paid an amount that equals or exceeds the contributions due for two preceding years.  Member States may continue to vote, if the General Assembly is satisfied that non-payment is due to conditions beyond the control of the Member.  Information on States in arrears was provided by the UN Secretary General in a letter to the President of the General Assembly in January 2021 (UN Documents Reference A/75/661). This document provided the following information with regard to countries in arrears with payments at that time: <table>    <tr>       <th>Member State </th>       <th>Minimum payment required to reduce amounts owed to remain below gross amounts assessed for the proceeding two years ($) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Central African Republic </td>       <td>29,395 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Comoros </td>       <td>871,632 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Congo </td>       <td>90,844 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Iran </td>       <td>16,251,298 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Libya </td>       <td>705,391 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Niger </td>       <td>6,733 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sao Tome and Principe </td>       <td>829,888 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Somalia </td>       <td>1,443,640 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Sudan </td>       <td>22,804 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Zimbabwe </td>       <td>81,770 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As of 21 May 2021, only five UN Member States were subject to the provisions of Article 19 of the UN Charter.

Trilogue discussions were held between the European Parliament and the Council which concluded last week with the agreement of a text which will now proceed through the remaining stages of the EU legislative process. This includes the renaming of the Digital Green Certificate to the EU Digital COVID Certificate (EUDCC).</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear in expressing its support for the EU Digital COVID Certificate proposal and welcomes the agreement now reached between the Council and European Parliament which will enable roll-out of the system and Digital COVID Certificates to begin to be issued to EU citizens in the coming weeks. July 1 has been set as the date for introduction of the system though the legislation now agreed provides a six-week transition period for Member States to complete all arrangements necessary to allow them to issue Certificates. The Minister for Health will advise in due course when the issuance of Digital COVID Certificates can commence in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, work to prepare for the implementation of the EUDCC continues in parallel to the legislative work and is being led by the Department of Health. The Department of Health are making all necessary operational, legal and communication arrangements accompanying the introduction of this regulation. The Department of Health hold regular meetings with the HSE to plan and discuss the technical development of the system and engage regularly with EU counterparts through the eHealth Network.  A Senior Officials Sub-Group has also been established by the Department of the Taoiseach involving a broad range of Departments to establish national policy in relation to the proposal.</p>  <p>  With regards to Ireland&rsquo;s non-membership of the Schengen Area, the regulation now agreed focuses on facilitating free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic and also includes provisions, with a Schengen legal basis, for Third Country Nationals (TCN) legally staying or residing in EU Member States. The relevant element for Ireland in the regulation ensures that certs issued to third-country nationals resident in Ireland will be automatically recognised by Schengen Member States provided that Ireland recognises in a reciprocal manner. It is intended to ensure that the 300,000 third-country nationals who are legally staying or legally residing in Ireland are eligible to be issued such certificates in line with the regulation and work is underway by Department of Health regarding this matter.</p></reply>

However, ease of travel is vital to our economic relationships and for building connections across the Atlantic. Ireland is deeply committed to people-to-people links with the US. We will work to ensure that the restrictions will not have any long-term impact on existing channels of migration, exchange and tourism which benefit our countries significantly.</p>  <p>  Although US immigration regulation is a matter for the US authorities, my Department has continued to encourage the US Embassy to maintain the processing of applications for exemptions to their travel restrictions for those travelling to the US for medical reasons. I have also raised the issue of resumption of travel between our two countries in my contacts with the US Administration, including during my meeting with US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, on Monday of this week. We agreed that it is important that we restore connectivity with the US, as soon as it is feasible, and safe, to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department has a very strong and positive working relationship with the US Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires and her team at the US Embassy in Dublin. We continue to engage closely with the Embassy, and with the US State Department via our Embassy in Washington D.C., including with regard to travel, and the associated restrictions, between the two countries.</p>  <p>  We are particularly keen that the current travel restrictions will not negatively impact the future of the J1 and Working Holiday Agreement programmes. I look forward to the time when we will work with the US again to promote travel between our countries, once COVID-19 crisis has abated, and in accordance with public health advice.</p></reply>

It is critical however that action against settlements must be both lawful and well-considered, since actions which are not fully thought-through risk ultimately being unwound, thereby undermining the cause they aim to support.</p>  <p>  In March 2016, the UN Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 31/36, calling upon the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to produce a database of all business enterprises involved in activities relating to Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory.</p>  <p>  The terms of the Resolution as adopted by the UN Human Rights Council were very broad, with the associated risk that this could potentially lead to unfair and counter-productive outcomes. The EU Members of the HRC therefore abstained in the vote on the Resolution. Despite these reservations, Ireland fully cooperated with requests for assistance by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the task they had been assigned.</p>  <p>  Ireland has always sought to protect the independence of the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights and notes the High Commissioner&rsquo;s commitment to discharge the mandate of the HRC Resolution 31/36 in a legally, factually and methodological sound manner. The database was published by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in February 2020. The Human Rights Council did not specify implications for entities listed in the database or put forward recommendations on how the information therein be used. In her report to the Human Rights Council&rsquo;s 46th Session, the High Commissioner reported that it was not possible for her Office to update the database on an annual basis due to the substantial resource implications.</p></reply>

I plan to formally open this diplomatic Mission later this year. </p>  <p>  To advance preparations for the Mission, a site visit to Manchester and Liverpool was undertaken last week by my officials. They visited the temporary premises that has been secured for the Consulate General, adjacent to Enterprise Ireland's Manchester Office. They also met with local officials and representatives of EU Consulates General based in Manchester. </p>  <p>  In March this year, the Government approved the appointment of a Consul General for the North of England and, more recently, a Vice Consul has been appointed to support the work of the Consulate. </p>  <p>  The opening of this new Consulate General for the North of England is delivering on our Global Ireland 2025 agenda to double Ireland's global influence and on commitments made in the Programme for Government. It will demonstrate our commitment to strengthening the British-Irish relationship following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. Working in partnership with Enterprise Ireland, the Consulate General will support the development of Irish commercial relations with UK&rsquo;s Northern Powerhouse, a region that claims to be Europe&rsquo;s 10th largest economy.  Ireland&rsquo;s commercial relationship with the UK remains extremely important and the UK is a key market for many Irish firms.  Alongside our Embassy in London, the new Consulate will also work to engage with the North of England's dynamic Irish community. </p>  <p>  We have been investing in our presence in the UK for some years. In 2019, Ireland's Consulate General in Cardiff was reopened and Enterprise Ireland opened its office in Manchester. Our Consulate General in Cardiff has recently moved to permanent premises and a formal opening for this Mission is also being planned as pandemic restrictions reduce. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that our Embassy in London, already Ireland&rsquo;s largest bilateral Mission, is properly resourced. The Department of Finance, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are now part of the Embassy team. The need to further develop Ireland's footprint and presence is being kept under ongoing review.</p></reply>

The review was proposed as an alternative to the independent public inquiry which had been recommended by Judge Cory.</p>  <p>  The report of the de Silva review was published in December 2012. In the report de Silva set out his findings of collusion in the murder by a number of State agents but he did not find any collusion at a political level. Speaking in Westminster on the day of the launch, PM Cameron described the findings as &lsquo;shocking&rsquo; and apologised to the Finucane family. The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste reiterated the Irish Government position on the need for an independent public inquiry into the murder in accordance with the Weston Park Agreement. </p>  <p>  In February 2019, the UK Supreme Court found that Pat Finucane&rsquo;s widow Geraldine had a legitimate expectation that a public inquiry into her husband&rsquo;s murder would be held, and that there has not been an Article 2-compliant inquiry into the case.</p>  <p>  As part of its commitment to the Weston Park Agreement, the Government has consistently supported the establishment of a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, as provided for under the Agreement reached by the UK and Irish Governments in 2001.</p>  <p>  I have conveyed to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the Government&rsquo;s disappointment with his decision not to hold a public inquiry into the Finucane case at that time, and underlined our consistent position that a public inquiry remains the way forward. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the Finucane family, with the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and with the UK Government to work towards a satisfactory resolution of this matter. So too will we continue to work in support of the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and all subsequent agreements to realise the full promise of peace and deeper societal reconciliation.</p></reply>

We have consistently raised the issue with the British Government, including at the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference.  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, at senior political level and in official level engagement by my Department, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue until a resolution is found.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government has welcomed the work of former Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, who is heading an Independent Police Team to conduct an analytical report on collusion in what has become known as the Glenanne Gang series of cases. This is very relevant to a number of cases including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The Government will be supportive of facilitating this investigation, subject to the requirements of the law, as we have other investigative processes in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government will also continue to maintain a close and cooperative relationship with Justice for the Forgotten, as we work to seek the full facts of the appalling events of 25 May 1974 and of other attacks in this jurisdiction during the Troubles.</p></reply>

A request is received by the Department of Foreign Affairs from the relevant embassy of the visiting/overflying foreign aircraft. This request is then forwarded to a number of parties including the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice for observations. In the Department of Defence's case this will also involve confirmation that an aircraft can be facilitated for landing at Casement Aerodrome if part of the request. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that permission was granted for the USAF C-17 to land at Baldonnel on Tuesday 18th May 2021, on a refuelling stop as part of a crew training mission en-route to the UK. </p>  <p>  The provision of diplomatic clearance to foreign military and State  aircraft to land and overfly the State is subject to strict conditions. Permission was granted in this case subject to the conditions that routinely apply to landings at Irish airports by foreign military aircraft;  namely that the aircraft is unarmed, carries no arms, ammunition or explosives and does not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flight in question does not form any part of a military exercise or operation. </p>  <p>  I am advised that over the last three years the Air Corps has acceded to requests, subject to the relevant approvals from the Department of Foreign Affiars, from the UK Royal Air Force and a number of EU partners including the Polish Air Force, the Slovenian Air Force, the Swedish Air Force and the Italian Air Force to use Casement Aerodrome . </p></reply>

Site visits to Military locations by members of the Commission has already taken place and I understand that further site visits have been scheduled if Covid restrictions permit.  </p><p>The Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, also met with members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the 20th April to discuss the on-going work of the Commission.

The Commission is to submit its report by the end of the year and it will be considered fully at that time.  </p></reply>

Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process.</p><p>In addition, in September 2019, the Government announced measures to increase access to Irish-medium education as part of the patronage process, including that five new primary schools being established from 2020-2022 are being designated for Irish-medium education.  This step is part of a framework which includes:</p><p>- Designating the language of a new primary school as Irish in some circumstances;</p><p>- Testing (on a pilot basis) the potential to cater for demand for English and Irish medium provision through, for example, delivering two 8-classroom primary schools (one English-medium and one Irish-medium) in a shared building/campus rather than delivering one 16-classroom primary school, subject to factors such as demand and site conditions;</p><p>- Exploring the potential to expand existing Irish-medium primary schools to meet unmet demand in an area;</p><p>- Providing opportunities for patrons of existing primary schools to change the language of instruction from English to Irish, such as is envisaged as part of the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process.</p><p>Details of schools that provide education through the medium of Irish are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p><p>There is currently 6 Gaelscoil catering for the Dublin 1, 7 and 9 areas.</p><p>Details of the places available at the school are outlined below:</p><p>- Gaelscoil Colaiste Mhuire Dublin 1 - currently caters for 8 mainstream teachers and there is a building project planned to provide a 16-classroom school at stage 2b of architectural planning.</p><p>- Scoil Caoimhin Dublin 1 - currently caters for 3 mainstream teachers and there is spare capacity in this school.</p><p>- Gaelscoil Barra Dublin 7 - This school was provided with a new school in 2017 and caters for 10 mainstream teachers.</p><p>- Scoil Mobhi Dublin 9 - this school has capacity for 10 mainstream classes.</p><p>- Gaelscoil Bhaile Munna Dublin 9 - this school was provided with a new 8-classroom school in 2017</p><p>- Gaelscoil Aine in Drumcondra/Marino/Dublin 1 - recently opened in  2019 in interim accommodation and will be providing for a 8-classroom school in the long term.</p></reply>

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  For the 2021/22 school year, an improvement of one point in the appointment threshold in primary schools has been introduced and schools will be provided with class teachers on the basis of of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils which is a historical low ratio.  In addition, a three point reduction in the retention scale has also been introduced for September 2021.  These measures will help to ensure that less pupils are required to recruit or retain a teacher.</p>  <p>  My Department has published a suite of helpful guidance for the safe and sustainable operation of schools including illustrative Primary Classroom Layouts to facilitate physical distancing requirements for primary schools. Each school should use their COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with the public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps school must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  </p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board. My Department has not received a staffing appeal from the school referred to by the Deputy.  The next meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board will be held in June.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

In its review, the Council took a whole system view considering the needs and diversity of the profession. In this regard, the diversity of stakeholder views was taken into account during the comprehensive consultation process. In the revision of the curricular subject requirements, standards have been maintained and safeguarded whilst granularity has been removed to enhance responsiveness and agility to system needs.</p>  <p>  The curricular subject requirements set out minimum standards that must be met for the purposes of registration with the Council as a post-primary teacher. The requirements provide HEIs with flexibilities in the design of their academic programmes and provides for them to continue to structure such programmes in the way that they wish.</p>  <p>  In relation to the subject of History, the requirements provide that applicants must hold a degree level qualification with History studied up to and including third year level; the study of Irish History is required and the studies must show that the holder has acquired sufficient knowledge, skills and understanding to teach the History syllabus/specification to the highest level in post-primary education.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>The exceptional review process was introduced for mainstream classes in the 2019/20 school year. Schools were notified of the arrangements from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, when SNA allocations were frozen, and automatically rolled over to the following school year. </p><p>The arrangements also included the following provisions: </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not necessary for this process. </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes as set out in Circular 0030/14, remains unchanged </p><p>Subsequently, in order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised.

Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.</p><p>DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019, stated that the allocations being made for 2019 would initially remain in place for a minimum of two years, following which, revised profiled allocations would be considered for schools from September 2021. </p><p>The NCSE Policy advice &lsquo;A Proposed new Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014)&rsquo; on which the SET allocation model is based, recommended that &lsquo;the additional teaching supports be left in place initially for a two-year period. As the new model becomes embedded in the system, this may be extended to three years.&rsquo;</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.</p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. </p><p>Maintaining the existing allocations of Special Education Teachers for the 2021/22 school year means that schools will not have to engage in an extensive redeployment of posts, or re-clustering, this year.</p><p>It also means that schools will have greater levels of certainty as to the staff that they will have in place for September.</p><p>No school will see a cut, or reduction, to their special education teaching support next year.</p><p>Where schools have growing enrolments year on year, they will receive an increased allocation, pending the next re-profiling. </p><p>Even in circumstances where some schools were anticipating a greater level of increase year on year, if full re profiling had occurred next year, the increased allocations for developing status combined with the existing allocation of the school will show an increased overall teacher allocation for these schools in 2021/22.</p><p>The allocations for 2021/22 which are being maintained comprise the allocations which were made for schools from September 2019 plus any additionality achieved since plus any developing hours for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school years.</p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Primary-Schools-Review-Application-2020.doc</p></reply>

Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes. Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on extending the SIM.  The project includes a number of elements:</p><p>- Provision of in-school therapies (speech and language, occupational)</p><p>- Allocation of SNAs on a frontloaded basis</p><p>- Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development</p><p>- Training of SNAs </p><p>In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid related work.

This decision, and the decision to adopt a model of Calculated Grades for the Leaving Certificate class of 2020, were made in response to the exceptional circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the disruption to face to face learning experienced by all students. </p>  <p>  This decision to introduce the process of accredited grades followed intensive engagement with education stakeholders, both bilaterally and through the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations 2021.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the exceptional measures adopted in 2020 and 2021 do not represent a precedent for future senior cycle arrangements. As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) have undertaken a significant review of senior cycle and an advisory report is due to be submitted to my Department this year. One of the themes included in that review is the appropriate arrangements for assessment, reporting and certification in senior cycle.  My Department looks forward to receiving and considering the NCCA&rsquo;s report and to further engagement with all stakeholders on this portant area of work. It would not be appropriate to make longer-term decisions in relation to senior cycle in advance of this. </p>  <p>The State Examinations Commission introduced a pilot provision for the 2019 Leaving Certificate examinations, allowing Leaving Certificate students who suffered a close family bereavement around the time of the state examinations in June to sit alternative papers in July. Under the arrangement, which was an extension of the scheme of Reasonable Accommodations at State Examinations (RACE), a Leaving Certificate candidate who suffered the loss of a close family member was permitted to defer up to three days of their examinations and to take those examinations at an alternative sitting in July.     The SEC had commenced a comprehensive review, involving engagement with stakeholders, of the broader issue of how best to support students experiencing all forms of trauma and adversity at examinations time The SEC will be recommencing the review process, which was interrupted due to Covid-19 , as soon as it is feasible. </p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>The exceptional review process was introduced for mainstream classes in the 2019/20 school year. Schools were notified of the arrangements from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, when SNA allocations were frozen, and automatically rolled over to the following school year. </p><p>The arrangements also included the following provisions: </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes as set out in Circular 0030/14, remains unchanged </p><p>Subsequently, in order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for an exceptional review.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators. There are currently approx. 996,000 customers with direct eligibility. The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  Extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation. There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility. Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.

This response will cover a wide range of policy areas and is being coordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p>The marriage bar describes a rule that existed in most of the public service, and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage. As it was a rule rather than law, married women could either return to work or take up other work, and many did. </p><p>Most public servants recruited prior to 1995 are not entitled to the State pension, regardless of gender and marital status. Therefore, the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment. The implications it had for public service pensions are matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The State pension system currently gives significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role, through the award of credits and/or the application of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (under the Yearly Average method for payment calculation) and/or the application of HomeCaring Periods (under the Aggregated Contribution Method or Interim Total Contributions Approach).  Details of these are -</p> <blockquote> 	Credits &ndash; PRSI Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits. Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.<br /><br />Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme - The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory). The Scheme, which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to be disregarded (from 1994), can have the effect of increasing the Yearly Average.<br /><br />HomeCaring Periods &ndash; This Scheme makes it easier for a home carer to qualify for a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory).  HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Aggregated Contribution Method (also known as Interim TCA or T12) of pension calculation.  HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution.  A maximum of 20 years HomeCaring periods can be used as part of the Aggregated Contribution Method calculation. </blockquote>  <p>Since April 2019 all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and Aggregated Contribution Method, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.  The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation.  </p><p>It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if his/her spouse is a State pensioner with significant household means, his/her most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on his/her personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-27a.612.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052700065#WRJ06900"><p> With reference to the details supplied, the person was not working part-time with the company before the Covid 19 pandemic. However, as this person was put on a shorter working week by the company due to the pandemic they are now classified as a part-time worker for the purposes of Jobseeker's Benefit. A person who works on a part-time basis and is employed for a set number of days each week and knows the days on which they will be employed may receive a jobseeker's payment as a part-time worker. The person was categorised as a part-time worker by the deciding officer based on the information supplied and their working pattern. While both casual and part-time workers may be  referred to internally in my Department as Casuals,  my officials have confirmed that the correct categorisation in this instance is part-time.</p>  <p>  The Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit payment week is calculated on a 6 day week with 1/5th deducted for each day worked. This means the number of unemployment days paid to a part-time worker in any week will reduce by one. For example if a person is paid Jobseeker's Benefit for 2 days, 3 days will be added to the cumulative total number of days for that week. As previously advised in PQ 416 my officials have examined the cumulative total of days paid in the individual&rsquo;s claim to date and I am advised that that the figure recorded in the Department is correct.</p>  <p>  The duration of payment for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid is 234 days, the equivalent of 9 months for a fully unemployed person. It is paid for 156 days for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid. </p>  <p>  My Department corresponds with the Jobseeker's Benefit recipient in advance of the expiry date of their claim and advises of rules governing re-qualification for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and also of the option to apply for the means tested Jobseeker's Allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  In order to requalify for jobseekers benefit when a claim exhausts benefit, in addition to satisfying the PRSI conditions, a part-time worker would have to suffered a further  substantial loss of employment and earnings. A person is regarded as having sustained a substantial loss of employment if they have lost at least one day of insurable employment in any period of 7 days, provided their reckonable earnings or reckonable income are reduced as a consequence of the loss of employment. In short, the number of days worked in any Jobseeker's Benefit week (i.e. Thurs - Wed) must be less than the normal number of days worked prior to the date of claim. Where a person&rsquo;s earnings have remained the same or increased since the original Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit claim, they would not be considered to satisfy the substantial loss condition for reckonable earnings/income. These conditions as set out in the Social  Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended). </p>  <p>  Jobseeker's Allowance has no duration limit as long as a person meets the qualifying scheme conditions including the means test. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Entitlement to such benefits is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria relevant to the scheme being applied for. </p><p>In general, self-employed people make PRSI contributions at class S. Where all qualification criteria for the particular scheme are satisfied, this class of PRSI gives access to the following benefits - </p><p>- Adoptive Benefit, </p><p>- Guardian's Payment (Contributory),  </p><p>- Invalidity Pension,</p><p>- Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed),</p><p>- Maternity Benefit,</p><p>- Parent's Benefit,</p><p>- Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension),  </p><p>- Paternity Benefit,</p><p>- State Pension (Contributory),</p><p>- Treatment Benefit, and</p><p>- Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.</p><p>The benefits to which class S PRSI does not provide access are - </p><p>- Carer's Benefit,</p><p>- Health and Safety Benefit, </p><p>- Illness Benefit, and</p><p>- Occupational Injuries Benefits. </p><p>Although self-employed people are not usually eligible for Illness Benefit, an exception was made in relation to Covid-19, primarily as a public health measure. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.</p><p>There has been an extensive expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits for self-employed social insurance contributors in recent years without any increase in the 4% rate of contribution made by them. In effect, self-employed contributors, in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors, have access to benefits which comprise over 90% of the value of all benefits available to employed contributors.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to giving consideration to increasing all classes of PRSI over time to replenish the Social Insurance Fund to help pay for measures and changes to be agreed including to the State pension system, improvements in short-term sick pay benefits, parental leave benefits, pay-related jobseeker's benefit and treatment benefits. </p><p>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs). </p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Programme specifies that Childcare Ireland's role will be to assist in <i>expanding high quality early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC), best practice and innovation in community and private settings, along with developing career paths for ELC and SAC staff, and for expansion of the early years curriculum, S&iacute;olta.</i></p><p>As a precursor to establishing Childcare Ireland, my Department is carrying out a comprehensive review of the operating model that administers all ELC and SAC schemes and initiatives. This was outlined in 'First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families' which was launched in November 2018.  </p><p>The ELC and SAC sector has grown substantially in the past decade. The review's objective is to ensure that the operating model is fit for purpose to implement Departmental childcare policy relating to quality, affordability and access, to the scale and standards required in an evolving and expanding sector.  </p><p>An independent external contractor has been engaged by my Department to undertake an analysis of the current landscape and consideration of options for a future operating model.  In this regard the review will aim to explore a variety of options in relation to how best the ELC and SAC operating model can be overseen by my Department in the coming years. </p><p>I am pleased to report that this review is well underway, and is due to conclude in the coming months.  A review Oversight Group, chaired by my Department, has been established, with regular meetings of that group having taken place throughout the year. </p><p>It is envisaged that the analysis carried out through the review will provide a robust evidence base to inform a decision concerning the establishment of Childcare Ireland and the range of functions it may provide.

Under this extension, three enrolment points were introduced &ndash; September, January and April.</p><p>The ECCE Programme was extended again in September 2018. Since then, children qualify for two years of pre-school under this Programme and can enrol when they are 2 years and 8 months of age  in September in the year they enrol and continue until they transfer to primary school (or reach 5 years 6 months).The changes to the ECCE Programme in 2018 fulfilled a committed in the Programme for a Partnership Government. </p><p>The return one enrolment point in 2018 ensured all children have equitable access to the ECCE Programme. </p><p>With three enrolment points, the number of ECCE weeks a child availed of averaged at 61 weeks but this ranged from 38 weeks and 88 weeks depending on the child&rsquo;s date of birth of and school starting age. The single enrolment point ensured all children could avail of 76 ECCE weeks.  Moreover, the return to one enrolment point helped to streamline the administration process to make it easier for pre-school providers to operate and budget for the programme year.</p><p>Funding for the ECCE Programme was increased by &euro;26m in Budget 2018. This funding was for this extension of the ECCE programme and a 7% increase in ECCE capitation. Bot changes were introduced from September 2018, therefore funding allocated under Budget 2018 does not reflect full year costs of these measures.</p><p>With regard to the impact of this change to the ECCE Programme on low-income families who have to pay for their child to attend pre-school if they are outside the eligible age ranges. </p><p>It is open for these families to apply for supports under the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). </p><p>The NCS, introduced in November 2019, represents the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for early learning and childcare. </p><p>It marks a shift away from previous schemes, which were based on medical card and social protection entitlements to a more progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  </p><p>Under the NCS, significantly more families are eligible for support.</p><p>NCS makes early learning and childcare more affordable, and in some instances free, to these families - with those on lowest incomes receiving the greatest level of support. </p><p>NCS is designed to ensure that access provided is at a level necessary to support positive child development outcomes regardless of whether parents are in work or study.  </p><p>Where parents are not engaged in work or study, the NCS subsidises up to 20 hours per week (standard hours).</p><p>Where parents are engaged in work or study, the NCS subsidises up to 45 hours of per week (enhanced hours).</p><p>Depending on the age of the child, low income families with pre-school children will be eligible for up &euro;102 per week in NCS subsidies where parents are not engaged in work or study and &euro;229.50 per week in NCS subsidies where parents are engaged in work or study (as outlined in the table provided). <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Child&rsquo;s Age</div></th>       <th><div>Maximum Subsidy Per Hour </div></th>       <th><div>Maximum Standard Hours Subsidy</div></th>       <th><div>Maximum Enhanced Hours Subsidy</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Less than 12 months old</td>       <td>&euro;5.10</td>       <td>&euro;102.00</td>       <td>&euro;229.50</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 to 35 months old </td>       <td>&euro;4.35</td>       <td>&euro;87.00</td>       <td>&euro;195.75</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years old or older and not yet qualifying for ECCE</td>       <td>&euro;3.95</td>       <td>&euro;79.00</td>       <td>&euro;177.75</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Services were required to provide Fire Safety Certificates as part of the re-registration process.  Many services have already re-registered and submitted a Fire Safety Certificate and some have re-registered subject to submitting an up to date Fire Safety Certificate.</p>  <p>  In August 2019, Tusla issued guidance for registered providers of early years services on the fire and planning requirements for the re-registration process. It is important to note that these were not new regulations, but guidance on the submission of documentation for the purpose of re-registration. Registration of early years services is granted only where Tusla is satisfied that the premises, operation and location of the service poses no unmanaged risk to children. All registered services are expected to have the appropriate fire certification in place.</p>  <p>  In an effort to assist providers in meeting the re-registration deadline, Tusla divided the process into two parts. The first part, including submission of an application form and critical supporting documentation, was completed at the end of 2019 and the deadline for the second part (submission of remaining documents) postponed until June 2020. Due to the unprecedented situation with Covid&ndash;19, a decision was taken to further defer the deadline for submission of remaining supporting documentation to 1 November 2021. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the suitability and safety of premises is a key concern in the assessment of quality provision for children in early years services. Section 58G of the Child Care Act, 1991 (as amended by Part 12 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013) places an onus on the providers of early years services to ensure that they take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children.  </p>  <p>  Given the absolute priority to keep children safe in these services, I have allocated funding under my Department's Annual Capital Programme 2021 to assist services complete any outstanding fire safety works required to obtain a Fire Safety Certificate. A total of &euro;5 million has been allocated across 643 services to carry out remedial works to ensure these services will be fully compliant with fire safety standards as set out in Tulsa's registration requirements.</p></reply>

The strategies include the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG), the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS), the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, the National LGBTI+ Strategy for Youth and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES).</p>  <p>  The implementation of each equality strategy is overseen by a steering committee which draws together State and non-State actors to deliver a better quality of life for all through targeted actions to promote social inclusion and improved access to public services.

The designated  liaison person is responsible for reporting allegations or concerns of child abuse to the Child and Family Agency or to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na </p><p>- ensuring that the organisation has clear written procedures on the action to be taken if allegations of abuse against employees/volunteers are made </p><p>- raising awareness within the organisation about potential risks to children&rsquo;s safety and welfare</p><p>- developing effective procedures for responding to accidents and complaints</p><p>Organisations should contact Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, where they are concerned about a child&rsquo;s welfare and co-operate with the statutory bodies in the ongoing assessment and management of the case.</p><p>In addition to the welfare work Tusla undertakes my Department also has numerous initiatives enacted to monitor and improve the welfare of children.</p><p>Such initiatives as Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures (BOBF) was the first overarching national policy framework for children and young people (aged 0-24 years). Almost all policy areas have a direct or indirect effect on children and young people&rsquo;s lives. The purpose of this framework was to coordinate policy across Government to achieve better outcomes. A follow on to the good work of BOBF is being derived at the moment. </p><p>My Department also takes into account the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which sets out the basic human rights every child is entitled to. These include:</p><p>- Survival rights such as nutrition, shelter and access to medical services</p><p>- Development rights such as education, access to information and freedom of thought </p><p>- Protection rights such as protection from abuse, neglect and exploitation</p><p>- Participation rights such expression of opinions and taking part in social and cultural activities</p><p>The Convention protects these rights by setting minimum standards that governments must meet in providing healthcare, education and legal and social services to children in their countries.</p><p>My Department works closely with the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and other Departments in relation to the UNCRC, allowing for issues of concern relating to children in care to be raised and appropriately addressed.</p><p>Tusla is the dedicated State agency responsible for improving child welfare and protection outcomes for children. Since its establishment in 2014, it has led a comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support service. Tusla represents a fundamental shift in the provision of family support, child protection, educational welfare and alternative care services. Central to their vision is the development of services that ensure children are safe and achieving their full potential. Tusla also recognises from a rights perspective that children and families should be active participants in the development and delivery of Tusla services. </p><p>Tusla has a Child Protection and Welfare Strategy 2017-2022, it outlines their strategic vision to provide an appropriate, proportionate and timely response to children at risk or in need of support in Ireland. Similarly its business plan and corporate strategy are all orientated to improve services including those for children in care.  </p><p>Services provided by Tusla are subject to internal reviews and audits and are also the subject of HIQA inspections in relation to Child Protection Services, Foster Care Services, Special Care and Tusla run Children's Residential Centres. This monitoring of provided services ensures issues  that are identified can be addressed and the quality of service is maintained or improved. In addition the Ombudsman for Children and Tusla&rsquo;s own National Review Panel will report on specific topics relating to the work of Tusla which prompts further improvements in Tusla services.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic and current effects of the cyber-attack of Friday 14 May 2021 Tusla continues to provide a frontline service to the vulnerable cohort of children in care.</p><p>The pandemic saw Tusla and my Department take numerous steps to respond to the public health crisis including:</p><p>- Increasing the number of foster carers through the implementation of emergency measures to allow swift recruitment and approval of foster carers. </p><p>- Liaising with stakeholders including HIQA and the Irish Foster Care Association regarding a potential amendment and temporary suspension of certain aspects of the regulations relating to the placement  of children in foster care, to ensure that family based care remains as the main form of alternative care in Ireland.  </p><p>- Supporting Tusla to draft a proposal outlining an alternative, remote assessment of potential foster carers to join an emergency panel of carers. </p><p>- Suspending a requirement to allow for more than two unrelated children to be placed with approved foster carers, if necessary.  </p><p>- Redeploying Youth Workers into the Children&rsquo;s Residential Care Sector in order to supply a potential shortfall in care staff. This will allow Youth Workers to voluntarily redeploy into the children&rsquo;s residential care sector for the period of emergency measures.  </p><p>- Maintaining contact between children in care and their families in line with HSE guidance and GDPR.</p><p>The recent cyber-attack on HSE IT systems has impacted on the operations of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. </p><p>Tusla continues to provide their full range of services and supports, with social workers and social care workers around the country continuing their core work with children and families, supported by manual systems. Priority is being accorded to Child Protection and Children in Care Services (including assessment of risk). While the referrals portal for this service is impacted, referrals are being taken via phone and post and anyone with a concern is being asked to contact their local duty social work office. Contact details are available on Tusla's website at www.tusla.ie/about/ict-update/</p><p>The National Childcare Information System (NCCIS) remains unavailable and at this point. Tusla is continuing to examine the risks and challenges to all operating systems and databases. It is important to note that the investigation into the cyber attack is ongoing and will take some time. </p><p>Tusla is actively engaged with key partner agencies,  including  An Garda Siochana, the Courts Service and family support services and is providing guidance and information to all staff, service users and the public via the Tusla website homepage. Tusla continues to liaise with the HSE on the restoration of systems and have deployed significant ICT resources to enable safe access to internal systems as soon as possible.</p><p>My Department continues to work closely with Tusla in supporting their response to addressing the impact and implications of the Cyber-attack which has effected Tusla systems and operations.</p></reply>

It was approved under the 2014-20 EGF Rules on an exceptional basis due to the serious impact these job losses had on employment and the national economy.    The mass redundancies in the Estonian tourism industry were argued to impact the national economy.  The unemployment rate in Estonia increased from 4.4% in 2019 to 6.8% in 2020.</p>  <p>  By comparison the unemployment rate in Ireland increased from 5% to 5.7% in the same period reflecting the range of measures introduced by the Government to provide income support for those whose employment has been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Regulations governing the EGF for 2021-27 reduce the minimum required number of redundancies from 500 to 200 redundancies. The 200 redundancies can occur over a four month period in a single company (including suppliers /downstream producers) or in a number of companies, particularly SMEs operating in the same or different economic sectors in a particular NUTS 2 region; or over a six-month period in a number of companies, particularly SMEs operating in a particular economic sector in one or two adjoining NUTS 2 regions. Temporary lay-offs do not constitute redundancies within the scope of the EGF.</p>  <p>  All reasons for restructuring are now eligible for support, including the economic effects of the coronavirus crisis and larger economic trends such as decarbonisation and automation.  Job losses arising from changing trade patterns or as a consequence of the financial and economic crisis for which workers can currently receive support, also continue to be eligible.  Cases can continue to be approved in exceptional circumstances, where the redundancies will have a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy, up to 15% of the maximum annual EGF budget of &euro;186m.</p>  <p>  My officials in the EGF Managing Authority monitor the number and timing of redundancies notified by employers to the Minister of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to assess the potential for EGF applications.  </p>  <p>  Separately my Department has a Job Loss Response Protocol with the Departments of Social Protection and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In a situation of job losses and redundancies, the Department of Social Protection is the lead Department. The protocol puts in place all the efforts to assist the impacted workers, including welfare entitlements, job-search assistance and access to the wide range of upskilling and reskilling opportunities available.</p></reply>

Therefore neither I nor my Department have a function in relation to such matters and it is not within my remit to determine admissions criteria or direct HEIs to admit certain students.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that a total of 632 CAO offers have been made to students whose results in the 2020 written Leaving Certificate examinations brought them into consideration for a higher preference offer, based on their 2020 CAO application.

However any offers made to these students will be on the basis of the 2021 points requirements, and will be made as part of CAO Round One.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups, or students with results from different years.</p></reply>

The determination, as to the total level of fees to be charged for non EU students is a matter for each institution in accordance with its own particular operational conditions and circumstances in ensuring quality education provision.</p><p>Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site. It would also not be feasible for student to undertake any planned international travel element of their chosen programme. While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p><p>Higher education institutions report that the actual cost of delivering such programmes has not reduced as a consequence of the pandemic and have experienced a range of additional costs in continuing to deliver programmes during the unique circumstances of the pandemic. In 2020 the Government has provided funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education for the academic year 20/21. This included &euro;150million in new funding and a re-prioritisation of &euro;18million. For the Education providers under the remit of my Department, the allocation includes funding towards Support to Front line response; Immediate ICT costs relating to online provision; Health and Safety Costs; Research costs and funds towards assisting the enrolment of International Students</p><p>I am very aware of the difficulties facing students during this pandemic.  In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all institutions to engage with students in relation to any issues, including fees.</p><p>Additional supports announced in July 2020 include a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education and an additional &euro;3m provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives.</p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above position, officials in my department and the HEA have sought additional information from  University of Limerick who advise that &ldquo;  <i>Changes in university teaching delivery has had a significant impact on the costs and benefits of higher and adult education. First, it changes the nature of a university&rsquo;s costs, reducing operational expenditure on utilities and services, but increasing the cost of IT services, staff training in new technologies and the provision of additional counselling and support services for students. On balance, the costs of higher education are higher in a blended model, and this has been reflected in additional government grants to universities.</i></p><p><i>The budgeting process and Masters programme pricing is completed by the Postgraduate Studies office in consultation with the faculty Deans. The eventual price of the Masters programme depends on a range of factors including the cost of delivery and the support structures including everything from administrative support to estate maintenance. The total fee after scholarships is approximately split 50/50 with central administration and the faculty. As an aside, scholarships for all programmes increased this year as a tacit acknowledgement of the impact of the pandemic. Within the Kemmy Business School, the fees received do not have a list of sub accounts where the monies are allocated to various costs.</i></p><p><i>The cost of the virtual workshop this year was significant and the time and effort put into the delivery of that workshop was equivalent or greater to the organisational effort for an international trip. For the KBS, the key task was to ensure that students achieved the learning outcomes as per our mandate from Higher Education Authority (HEA) and audited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). We are confident that these outcomes were achieved.</i></p><p><i>The cost of delivery between the international trip and virtual workshop or other alternatives cannot be distinguished. While it is true to say that some operational costs such as heat, light, etc. have decreased other costs have increased. These increased costs include considerable human and technological resources into pivoting to online delivery at very short notice. These costs are spread across the campus and it is not possible to allocate them to particular programmes.</i></p><p><i>Overall, responding to the pandemic has changed the way that we provide education, but it does not mean that either the cost of provision or the value of the student learning is diminished. Despite the very real challenges, we have continued to adapt our education delivery in order to teach, assess and graduate students with the same high qualifications and skills&rdquo;.</i></p></reply>

The matters raised are an internal matter for the University of Limerick (UL) and my Department is therefore not in a position to intervene in the related policies of the University.</p><p>Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site. In accordance with Public Health advice, in the majority of circumstances it has also not been possible for students to undertake planned international travel as part of their chosen programme. While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p><p>I am very aware of the difficulties facing students during this pandemic.  In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all institutions to engage with students in relation to any issues, including fees.</p><p>In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 2020/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state.  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution. This builds on the additional supports announced in July including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education and an additional &euro;3m provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives.</p><p>Higher education institutions report that the actual cost of delivering such programmes has not reduced as a consequence of the pandemic and have experienced a range of additional costs in continuing to deliver programmes during the unique circumstances of the pandemic. In 2020 the Government has provided funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education for the academic year 20/21. This included &euro;150million in new funding and a re-prioritisation of &euro;18million. For the Education providers under the remit of my Department, the allocation includes funding towards Support to Front line response; Immediate ICT costs relating to online provision; Health and Safety Costs; Research costs and funds towards assisting the enrolment of International Students</p><p>Notwithstanding the above position, I sought additional information from University of Limerick which has advised that &ldquo;  <i>Changes in university teaching delivery has had a significant impact on the costs and benefits of higher and adult education. First, it changes the nature of a university&rsquo;s costs, reducing operational expenditure on utilities and services, but increasing the cost of IT services, staff training in new technologies and the provision of additional counselling and support services for students. On balance, the costs of higher education are higher in a blended model, and this has been reflected in additional government grants to universities.</i></p><p><i>The budgeting process and Masters programme pricing is completed by the Postgraduate Studies office in consultation with the faculty Deans. The eventual price of the Masters programme depends on a range of factors including the cost of delivery and the support structures including everything from administrative support to estate maintenance. The total fee after scholarships is approximately split 50/50 with central administration and the faculty. As an aside, scholarships for all programmes increased this year as a tacit acknowledgement of the impact of the pandemic. Within the Kemmy Business School, the fees received do not have a list of sub accounts where the monies are allocated to various costs.</i></p><p><i>The cost of the virtual workshop this year was significant and the time and effort put into the delivery of that workshop was equivalent or greater to the organisational effort for an international trip. For the KBS, the key task was to ensure that students achieved the learning outcomes as per our mandate from Higher Education Authority (HEA) and audited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). We are confident that these outcomes were achieved.</i></p><p><i>The cost of delivery between the international trip and virtual workshop or other alternatives cannot be distinguished. While it is true to say that some operational costs such as heat, light, etc. have decreased other costs have increased. These increased costs include considerable human and technological resources into pivoting to online delivery at very short notice. These costs are spread across the campus and it is not possible to allocate them to particular programmes.</i></p><p><i>Overall, responding to the pandemic has changed the way that we provide education, but it does not mean that either the cost of provision or the value of the student learning is diminished. Despite the very real challenges, we have continued to adapt our education delivery in order to teach, assess and graduate students with the same high qualifications and skills&rdquo;.</i></p></reply>

Section 5 of the 1986 Act provides that a foreign divorce may only be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled on the date the divorce proceedings were instituted. The determination of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; includes an assessment of the intention of the person to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  Recognition of foreign divorces granted prior to the coming into operation of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 is governed by common law domicile rules which are now consistent with those in the 1986 Act.</p>  <p>  The recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment granted in another EU Member State on or after 1 March 2001 is governed by EU Council Regulation 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (also known as the Brussels II bis or the Brussels IIa Regulation). This Regulation provides for EU judicial co-operation and recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border matrimonial matters. Under the Regulation, divorces, legal separations or marriage annulments granted in all EU States, with the exception of Denmark, are entitled to recognition if granted in accordance with jurisdictional criteria specified in the Regulation. Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition. The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 no longer applies to the recognition of divorces covered by the Regulation.</p>  <p>  Part 19 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 makes provision for the recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the United Kingdom or Gibraltar and has been in operation since 11.00 p.m. on 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  Where there is an issue as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition, section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows a person to apply to court for a declaration as to marital status, including a declaration as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition in the State. </p>  <p>  The Thirty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Act 2019 was signed into law on 11 June 2019 following its approval by the people in a referendum on 24 May 2019. </p>  <p>  That Act deleted the following subsection from Article 41.3 of the Constitution:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; No person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage so dissolved.&rdquo;,</p>  <p>  and substituted that subsection with the following:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; Provision may be made by law for the recognition under the law of the State of a dissolution of marriage granted under the civil law of another state.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The amendment will permit a future change in the law to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces. </p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform, is examining the recognition of foreign divorces. When the expert report of the Law Reform Commission is completed, it will provide valuable guidance for the development of proposals for legislation on the recognition of foreign divorces. </p></reply>

The programme provides investors with the opportunity to invest in Ireland. Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest. </p><p>Since its inception, more than 2,000 IIP applications have been received. A breakdown of applications by country of origin is set out in the table below.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Country of Origin</th>       <th>Number of IIP applications</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>China (including Hong Kong)</td>       <td>1,933</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>USA</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vietnam</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>India </td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pakistan</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rest of the world</td>       <td>71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>2,070</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Not all successful IIP applicants are visa required nationals. Applicants that are visa required can apply for a 'D' visa to register their permission. Visa statistics are not maintained by the Immigration Services of my Department in a manner to enable me to provide details of 'D' visa applications submitted by successful applicants under the IIP. </p><p>Successful applicants under the IIP and their nominated family members may be granted a residence permission in Ireland under Stamp 4 conditions. Stamp 4 conditions permit non-EEA nationals to work, study or start their own businesses in Ireland.  </p><p>An investment under the IIP does not confer any preferential entitlement to citizenship. A successful IIP applicant wishing to attain citizenship by naturalisation would have to submit an application that meets the criteria as provided for in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. </p><p>All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with legislation and application statistics are not maintained in a manner as to identify the qualifying immigration permission held by applicants for naturalisation. However, all applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity. </p><p>Neither I, Minister McEntee nor any Minister for Justice have had any engagements with the Central Bank, the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the IIP. However, the Department of Finance is represented on the Evaluation Committee that assesses  IIP applications and there is ongoing engagement at official level with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the Common Reporting Standards approved by the OECD for information sharing on such programmes.</p><p>The IIP has been subject to a number of reviews, both internal and external, in recent years. Following a tender process, a contract to carry out an external review was signed in June 2019. This review was to be carried out in two phases. The Terms of Reference for the review are published on the Immigration Service website  at: www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/New%20Programmes%20for%20Investors%20and%20Entrepreneurs. </p><p>The second phase of the review has recently been completed and is being considered by my Department. In the meantime, applications for investment in social housing under the IIP continue to be assessed by the independent Evaluation Committee and, where assessed positively, are accepted and processed.</p></reply>

My key focus, at all times, is the protection and enhancement of the incomes of our farmers, fishers and food producers. </p>  <p>  The conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the UK and Australia could have implications for Irish agri-food exports to the UK. The extent of these implications, however, would depend on the specific agri-food market access provisions agreed between the UK and Australia as part of those negotiations. It is difficult to comment more fully on these implications without greater certainty as to what exactly may be agreed between the UK and Australia. </p>  <p>  It is important to remember that any FTA signed by the UK with a third country will only affect that country&rsquo;s access to the UK market. </p>  <p>  The EU-UK TCA ensures continued quota and tariff-free access for Irish agri-food goods to the UK market, and this has been in operation since 1 January 2021.  Irish agri-food goods may also avail of the access provided to other third countries based on the other FTAs concluded by the EU over many decades. Finally, Ireland is a member of the EU and has full unimpeded access to the EU Single Market of 450 million people.</p>  <p>  I am continually aware of the international global trade dynamic and its potential impact on Irish agriculture.

My ambition is to protect the incomes of our farm families through a fair and flexible CAP.</p>  <p>  The Council position includes the proposed introduction of ECO schemes into the system of direct payments. A ring-fenced budgetary amount for ECO schemes of 20% of the direct payment budget has been proposed by Agriculture Ministers, with a two-year 'learning' period permitted at the start of the CAP Strategic Plan, to allow Member States avoid any loss of unspent funds due to lower-than-expected take-up of ECO schemes.   The Parliament&rsquo;s approach is more prescriptive.  They are seeking that 30% of Direct Payments be directed to ECO schemes and that there would be no learning phase.</p>  <p>  Member States must introduce ECO schemes but farmers can choose whether to apply.  However, participation in ECO schemes will allow farmers maximise their payments.  A significant concern for all  Member States, is the potential loss of unspent funds in the case of low uptake by farmers and recent discussions are focussing on how to mitigate this risk.  This is not a situation I want to see. </p>  <p>  While I welcome the introduction of ECO schemes in the next CAP, I have been consistent in my approach that I cannot accept a potentially serious risk to the loss of CAP funding with the introduction of new ECO schemes if Member States do not have the necessary flexibiltiy to manage this.   </p>  <p>  Trilogue discussions are still ongoing and final agreement on the CAP, including the green architecture, is dependent on the outcome of this process.

The draft CSP will also be subject to an ex-ante evaluation, Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment including a public consultation on the draft CSP and draft Environmental Report.  </p>  <p>  I have, with my officials, continued to engage extensively with stakeholders on the future of CAP.  Consultations on the development of the CSP will continue via the CAP Consultative Committee, which comprises representatives of the main stakeholders including farm bodies, NGOs (including the Environmental Pillar), industry representatives and academia. It also includes representatives from Government Departments including DPER, DRCD, DECC, DHLGH (NPWS), and Government Agencies, including Bord Bia, Teagasc and the EPA. The Committee has met on 18 occasions with further meetings planned throughout 2021. </p>  <p>  Further public consultations on the development of the CSP are being considered. I will also continue to engage with stakeholders as we develop our CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 to meet the deadline of submission to the Commission by 1st January 2023. </p>  <p>  Trilogue negotiations on the CAP proposals are ongoing in Brussels.  Until these have concluded, we will not have certainty with regard to the options available to Ireland under the CAP proposals.  However, it is expected that the new Regulations will allow Member States the option to consider the provision of limited coupled supports if they consider these appropriate.  </p>  <p>  Ireland decoupled the Single Farm Payment from livestock numbers following the CAP Reform in 2008, in order to permit farmers to respond to market signals, and obviate the obligation to keep potentially loss making animals to secure the Single Farm Payment.  The view taken at the time was that coupled payments obliged farmers to keep animals, even when market conditions were poor, that they potentially reduced the quality of livestock and that there was an increased risk of leakage of coupled subsidies to the processing sector.</p>  <p>  Coupled payments would not, of course, lead to an increase in payments for farmers as they would be funded from within the Pillar I envelope.        </p>  <p>  My view is that supports for the livestock sector can be better targeted through specific schemes aimed at improving the economic and environmental sustainability, as well as the animal welfare credentials, of beef and sheep production. Traditional &lsquo;coupled&rsquo; payments as set out in the draft Regulations would not allow for the effective targeting of such supports. </p>  <p>  Work is currently underway on development of supports for the sector under the next CAP which will be aimed at further supporting the economic, environmental and social sustainability of beef and sheep farms in Ireland.   </p></reply>

AgClimatise actions have been referenced in all engagement with stakeholders and with industry over recent months. </p>  <p>  This is to ensure that there is a broad understanding of the direction of travel identified including by way of example with the fertiliser industry and co-ops etc regarding the move towards protected urea.

The European Parliament is seeking for a higher level of convergence.

The draft proposals include a number of measures which concern redistribution of direct payments, including:</p>  <p>  1. An overall cap of &euro;100,000;</p>  <p>  2. Degressive reduction of payments above &euro;60,000;</p>  <p>  3. A complementary redistributive income support scheme, and</p>  <p>  4. The convergence of payments towards the average payment per hectare nationally.</p>  <p>  At present, Ireland has implemented the maximum level of capping allowed under the regulations -100% capping of payment entitlement value above &euro;150,000. If the maximum capping allowable under the proposed regulations were implemented, the maximum BISS payment would be c. &euro;82,000. It seems likely that other direct payments, such as eco-schemes, would be excluded from this capping.</p>  <p>  These redistributive mechanisms are core EU policies and are set to continue under the draft regulations for the new CAP. There has been extensive engagement and consultation with stakeholders on this process since the draft proposals were announced. I continue to engage with stakeholders with a view to ensuring that the developing EU regulations include a suite of measures which will enable us to ensure the fair implementation of these vital financial supports. </p>  <p>  These measures, and others under the direct payments ceiling, are inextricably linked to each other. This means that each time one of the elements is changed, each of the other elements also are affected. Discussions are continuing around the new legislative proposals for the CAP and the final shape of the regulations and the options available to Member States will not be clear until this process is concluded.

Prior to this, the Department identified eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as Family Farm Income statistics, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, stocking density etc. </p>  <p>  From 2019 onwards, it was required that eligible areas must instead be designated by reference to a range of bio-physical criteria such as, for example, low temperature, excess soil moisture and poor chemical properties.  The process also took into account constraints facing offshore island farming and three other identified categories of land: areas of environmental importance, areas facing structural constraints relating to fragmentation and farm size and areas facing structural constraints relating to the prevalence of grassland cover and field size.</p>  <p>  Following the completion of this process, areas under the scheme which were determined to be constrained were further classified into a number of different land categories as follows:</p>  <p>  - Category 1 land</p>  <p>  - Category 2 land</p>  <p>  - Category 3 land</p>  <p>  These categories are based on the considerations set out in Article 31(1) of Regulation 1305/2013.  The system of farming prevalent in Category 1 is characterised by extensive farming practices focused on livestock management on higher ground. By contrast, Category 2 is characterised by extensive livestock grazing practices on lower ground, while Category 3 is less extensive in nature and characterised by grazing livestock enterprises.</p>  <p>  Areas of Specific Constraints (Island Farming) formed an additional land category.</p>  <p>  Payment rates under the existing scheme are based on an examination of standard output data from the Central Statistics Office Census of Agriculture and data from DAFM databases. This facilitated a comparison at district electoral division (DED) level of DEDs containing designated land, with DEDs containing no designated land. CSO Standard output figures show for Category 1 areas only an average SO/ha of &euro;236.76, for Category 2 areas only an average SO/ha of &euro;742.81, for Category 3 areas only an average SO/ha of &euro;1020.38, and for non-designated areas an average SO/ha of &euro;1206.86.</p>  <p>  Based on these figures, the payment rates set out in the scheme are in line with the provision of Article 31 (1) of Regulation 1305/2013 in that the support granted annually per hectare will compensate beneficiaries for &ldquo;part of the additional costs and income foregone related to the constraints for agricultural production in the area concerned.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Payment rates are designed to reflect the differences between these three categories.</p>  <p>  In the case of support for offshore farming, eligible costs are determined on the basis of the costs and income foregone linked to the specific constraints experienced by off shore island farmers. Island farmers already incur the additional costs and lower productivity that other mainland farmers situated on Areas of Natural Constraints also incur. However, there are additional costs borne by island farmers, which cover all of the main farming activities. These include higher input costs (fertiliser and machinery), animal feed, and other services such as veterinary, consultancy, and maintenance charges.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the existing criteria for the determination of the status of land under the scheme, established following the extensive re-designation process undertaken ahead of the 2019 ANC scheme, will continue to form the basis of the determination of land designated as constrained under the new CAP.  </p>  <p>  The payment rates set out in the existing scheme also show a direct relationship to the level of constraint and production on the different categories of land designated as constrained.   On that basis, it is also the intention to ensure that the existing basis of the determination of the rates of payment for each category of land designated as disadvantaged under the scheme also forms the basis for the payment rates which will be in place for the new CAP.</p>  <p>  The current payment rates under the ANC scheme are:</p>  <p>  - Category 1 Land: &euro;148 on the first 12 eligible hectares or part thereof, and &euro; 112 per hectare on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 34 hectares.</p>  <p>  - Category 2 Land: &euro;111 on the first 10 eligible hectares or part thereof, and &euro;104 per hectare on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 30 hectares.</p>  <p>  - Category 3 Land: &euro;93 on the first 8 eligible hectares or part thereof, and &euro;88.25 per hectare on remaining hectares up to a maximum of 30 hectares.</p>  <p>  - Areas of Specific Constraints (Island Farming): &euro;250 on the first 20 eligible hectares or part thereof, &euro;170 on greater than 20 hectares to less than or equal to 34 hectares and &euro;70.00 on greater than 34 hectares or less than or equal to 40 hectares.</p></reply>

The structure of Project Woodland comprises four Working Groups, with each focussing on a set of recommendations made in the Mackinnon report. Working Group 2, called 'A Shared National Approach', has been tasked to develop a new Forestry Strategy for Ireland. The group has started working on a SWOT and PESTLE analysis for the new Forestry Strategy and will develop and implement an engagement strategy in 2021, including all stakeholders in the forestry sector as well as the general public.</p><p>While the GLAS application process did not capture a view of farm enterprise types, an analysis of GLAS undertaken in 2019 and based on 2017 data indictated that sheep farmers accounted for 52% of GLAS participants, cattle farmers 37% and dairy 13%. </p><p>Further studies on GLAS are published at gov.ie - Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 (www.gov.ie).</p></reply>

Section 12 of the GLAS terms and conditions clearly indicates that afforestation is fully compatible with GLAS and is recognised as contributing to the creation of a valuable landscape mosaic at farm-level. It is also important to note that GLAS is not a whole of farm scheme and that opportunities continue to exist for afforestation and for other forestry supports on parcels that do not contain GLAS actions.  </p>  <p>  The new Results-Based Environmental Agri Pilot (REAP) is designed to trial an agri-environment results-based scoring system at a national level with a view to identifying upscaling potential for possible inclusion in the next flagship national agri-environment scheme to follow on from GLAS. While REAP will focus on grassland based actions, it offers support for complementary actions such as tree and hedge planting where such actions have the potential to improve the environmental score of the land area. </p>  <p>  Both terms and conditions are published and there are no plans to make changes to them.</p>  <p>  The new CAP Regulation aims to increase the environmental and climate ambition of Member States.  This has the potential to support tree planting and farm forestry, as part of a sustainable farming model, and such options will be explored.  Forestry can provide a complementary and supplementary activity to schemes on farms and my officials are engaged in a process of developing schemes to ensure that there is integration between the CAP Strategic Plan and the next Forestry Programme. </p></reply>

My colleague Minister of State Pippa Hackett has announced her intention to explore how such planting along riparian margins could be promoted at scale.

In this regard, the Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations. The Department is also a partner in the All Ireland Pollinator Plan 2021 &ndash; 2025 and is a member of the All-Ireland Honeybee Strategy Steering Group.</p>  <p>  The main financial support available to beekeepers is through The Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector. The scheme provides grants to help support the commercial horticulture sector including beekeepers. It is open to all horticultural producers and is a mechanism that can assist beekeepers invest in their apiaries and associated apiculture equipment for the future. The scheme is due to reopen for applications in October 2021. This Scheme is 100% funded by the Irish Government. Details of the scheme and eligibility requirements can be found at www.gov.ie/en/publication/b16bf-horticulture-schemes/ .</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department also provides annual grants to Irish National Beekeepers associations to support members and branches to pursue the craft of beekeeping to the highest standards and to also inform the general public about the environmental role that bees play in maintaining Irish biodiversity and crop production. </p>  <p>  Further support to the beekeeping sector in Ireland is provided through the National Apiculture Programme. This programme is co-funded by the Department and the EU and provides funding to carry out applied research for the Irish apiculture sector. The National Apiculture Programme was awarded to a suitable research institution to carry out research in the area. This research when concluded will be beneficial to many beekeepers in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department has funded a number of studies under the Genetic Research Grant Aid Scheme looking at various aspects of honeybee species and specifically apis mellifera melliferra. In 2021, funding has been allocated for an innovative queen rearing project.</p>  <p>  The Department also provides a bee health service, free of charge, facilitating the early detection of pests and pathogens which is key to maintaining healthy stock of bees in Ireland. This bee health service also operates the Sentinel Apiary Programme along with volunteer beekeepers throughout Ireland.

This necessitated a quick turnaround and I am happy to confirm that the project is on track despite the extremely tight timeframe.  It has now closed and the Department is currently assessing the applications.  </p>  <p>  Driving the organic farming sector is also a key priority for the Deaprtment and we have set an ambitious target in the Programme for Government to bring the participation rate up to the EU average during the lifetime of this Government. The main support available to organic farmers is the Organic Farming Scheme which we rolled over to this year by providing an extra year's contract to all particpants. </p>  <p>  We also reopened it this year to new entrants and a further 317 applications were received to join the latest tranche of the scheme. </p>  <p>  In terms of particpation in both schemes, double funding under schemes is prohibited under EU regulations which was a consideration in limiting REAP to farmers who are not in any of the schemes or projects such as GLAS and Organics.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-27a.860.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021052700069#WRN02800"><p>My Department's Community Services Programme (CSP) supports over 420 community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model. The CSP provides an annual co-funding contribution of &euro;19,033 for each fulltime equivalent (FTE) position being supported, and, where warranted, provides &euro;32,000 towards the cost of employing a manager. Qualifying organisations must be social enterprises capable of generating income from their activities in order to meet the full salary costs of the supported posts, for example, from income received from the public use of facilities and services.</p>  <p>  In 2020, Indecon International Economic Consultants carried out an independent review of the CSP on behalf of my Department. The final report was published in September 2020 and is available on my Department's website. My Department and Pobal have commenced work on the restructuring of the Programme, in association with the CSP Consultative Group. Pending the transition to the new restructured Programme, the scheme is closed to new applications through the Expression Of Interest process.  However, it is anticipated that the Programme will facilitate new entrants via calls to address identified gaps in service delivery later in 2021.    </p>  <p>  As a first step in that regard, on 28 April, my Department, in collaboration with the Department for Transport, launched a three-year pilot initiative for the provision of high quality up-cycled bicycles and e-bikes for those on low incomes and/or those who are most marginalised and disadvantaged.  </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;3m is being provided by the Department of Transport for this initiative over a three-year period and will be made available through my Department's Community Services Programme.  </p>  <p>  Applications are now being sought from eligible organisations for inclusion on this programme.  Organisations eligible to apply are those currently supported under the Community Services Programme or alternatively are in a Partnership/Consortium of which at least one member is currently a CSP supported organisation.    </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the pilot will support up to 6 social enterprises in 2021.  Full details of the scheme and the necessary application form are available on the Department's website. The closing date for applications is noon, 28 May. </p></reply>
