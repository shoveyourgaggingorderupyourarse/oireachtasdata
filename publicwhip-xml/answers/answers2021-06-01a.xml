The then Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was consulted as part of this process.The goal of the Charter is to ensure that every Local Authority embeds decarbonisation, sustainable development and climate resilience into all aspects of the work they do.  The Charter acknowledges the need to take collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change, while also committing Local Authorities to being advocates for climate action. Under the Charter, Local Authorities will measure the carbon impact of activities and implement measures to reduce carbon emissions in line with national objectives, including a 50% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.</p><p>In 2018, my Department entered into a five year financial commitment of &euro;10 million to establish four Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs).  Mayo County Council is the lead authority for the Atlantic Seaboard North region, which also includes the Local Authorities for counties Mayo<font color="#0A0A0A">, Sligo, Donegal and Galway, as well as Galway City</font>. My Department engages with all four CAROs on a regular basis, in particular through participation in the National Local Authority Climate Action Steering Group. Under the National Adaptation Framework, each Local Authority has developed a Local Adaptation Strategy. These strategies are now being implemented, and each CARO is working with the Local Authorities in its region to both facilitate and monitor implementation of the local climate adaptation actions within the strategies. </p><p>The Climate Action Bill further strengthens the role of Local Authorities in climate action. It sets out legislative requirements for each Local Authority to prepare a Climate Action Plan, which will include both mitigation and adaptation measures and be updated every five years. These plans will have to be consistent with national climate plans and strategies, and Local Authorities will have to liaise with each other in the preparation of these plans.</p><p>To build the necessary capacity, my Department is also funding and engaging with the CAROs in relation to the implementation of a new Local Authority climate action training programme. This programme is increasing knowledge of climate change and the need for action among all Local Authority staff, and will facilitate both climate mitigation and adaptation at local level.</p></reply>

To date, over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme and in 2020 the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was over &euro;14,800.    I have secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. Funding for the energy poverty retrofit schemes has also increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather. </p>  <p>  The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p></reply>

This process began with the launch of a public consultation on the design of a DRS for Ireland in October last year.  It was encouraging to see the level of public engagement in this first consultation with the majority of the 364 submissions received supporting the introduction of the Scheme and favouring a centralised, legislation based system, operated by a single entity.   The submissions received under this consultation will be published shortly on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  Following this consultation, a stakeholder working group, consisting of beverage producers, retailers, eNGOs and waste collectors was established to progress the design of the system.  The Department of Agriculture, Environment Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland have sat in on the working group discussions as observers.  </p>  <p>  The second step in the process was a further consultation on the regulatory framework for the Scheme which concluded on 7 May. Submissions received under this are currently being assessed and will inform the working group in their deliberations on a final regulatory framework.</p>  <p>  I intend to finalise Regulations enabling the introduction of the Deposit and Return scheme early in the third quarter of this year, in order to enable the scheme to commence in the third quarter of 2022.</p></reply>

I am advised that as of 27 May, 2,437  (17.8%) of these have been surveyed by National Broadband Ireland (NBI). Surveying is the first step to delivering the new fibre network and informs design solutions for fibre network provision.   Detailed designs are used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir, where Open eir ensure poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and are made ready for other required infrastructure. Equipment ordering decisions are dependent on this step. Survey data is required to initiate pre-works paving the way for fibre deployment. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers and tree trimming. On completion of pre-works, the main construction works can commence.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NBI that surveys are completed or ongoing in Skerries, Balbriggan, around Fingal, Castleknock, Blanchardstown, Clonsilla, Ongar, Chapelizod, Ballyfermot, Cabra, Bluebell, Finglas,City West, Bohernabreena, Rathcoole, Cruagh, Kilakee, Ballychorus, Ticknock and Ballybrack. Pre-works are in progress around Skerries, City West, Bohernabreena and Rathcoole.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas in Dublin through the NBI website www.NBI.ie which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 27 May, 317 Broadband Connection Points sites have been installed by NBI. A number of BCPs are connected in County Dublin including Glenasmole Community Centre, Man O War GAA Club, Fingal Ravens GAA Club, Stars Of Erin GAA , Dublin Mountain Community Centre, Tyrrelstown Community Centre and Newbridge House &amp;amp; Farm.</p>  <p>  Balscadden National School is connected to high speed broadband as part of this initiative.</p></reply>

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021, when enacted, will introduce a number of new obligations to help ensure good planning in respect of climate action. The Bill introduces a requirement to annually revise the Climate Action Plan and  prepare, at least once every five years, a National Long Term Climate Action Strategy. Annual revisions to the Climate Action Plan will focus on the near and medium term perspectives; be consistent with the adopted carbon budget programme; and provide a roadmap of actions, including sectoral actions, that are needed to comply with  the carbon budgets and sectoral emission ceilings. The National Long Term Climate Action Strategy will outline, over a minimum thirty year period, the range of opportunities and transition pathways towards the national climate objective.   Work is currently underway across Government on the development of a new Climate Action Plan for 2021. This plan will include additional policies and measures in every sector to bring about the significant changes needed to transform our society. Furthermore, the Government is undertaking a review of the National Development Plan (NDP), which will look at the necessary capital investment in areas such as energy, transport and the built environment to support delivery of the Programme for Government commitment. The low-carbon transition will require significant private investment alongside Exchequer expenditure on a sustained basis over a number of decades. Polices and measures will need to integrate change into existing spending plans and create the regulatory requirements, market incentives and innovative space to achieve our climate objectives.</p></reply>

This was subsequently included as a commitment in the Programme for Government.    ESB has been participating in a number of working groups established under the Just Transition programme which looked at the future of the Midlands area following the closure of the ESB Midlands stations and the ending of the harvesting of peat by Bord na M&oacute;na.  </p>  <p>  One of the working groups, which included  representatives of my Department, relevant Local Authorities, and the Just Transition Commissioner, looked specifically at how the existing infrastructure on the station sites might form a part of a future renewable energy hub. To that end, ESB commissioned an internal engineering report to examine how the power plants might be re-used in the future. Options reviewed included the possibility of using other types of fuel. The report was subsequently reviewed by Fichtner, an external international consultancy firm with acknowledged expertise in these areas. These reports have not identified any viable alternative use for the existing power plants.</p>  <p>  While the management of ESB-owned facilities is the responsibility of the Board and management of the ESB, the company has informed the Department that it plans to lodge planning applications shortly to develop additional energy services at these sites. These will include synchronous condensers and energy storage capabilities at both locations.</p></reply>

Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p>  <p>  The Remote Working Strategy was published in January by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that remote working is a permanent feature in the Irish workplace in a way that maximises economic, social and environmental benefits. The Programme for Government recognises that the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to such policies and has committed to seek to accelerate its roll out. My Department continues to explore the potential to accelerate the roll out with National Broadband Ireland. </p></reply>

The National Cyber Strategy 2019-2024 sets out the role of the NCSC to support Government Departments and other public bodies to improve the resilience and security of their IT systems to better protect services that our people rely upon, and their data. The NCSC works very closely with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) in this regard.   The NCSC acts as a central contact point in the event of a Government- or nation-wide cyber security incident affecting the State. The NCSC also coordinates and supports the response to significant incidents, with the lead role being taken by the entity affected by the incident. The Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is the team within the NCSC that leads in responding to cyber security incidents. The CSIRT has achieved international accreditation and its personnel are highly-regarded internationally. It is this team that engages with the affected body to support it in addressing the threat.</p>  <p>  Information sharing is a key component of the work of the NCSC whereby it acts as a source of expert advice and guidance, but also as a "clearing house" for information. That is to say it takes in threat intelligence data, trends and risks data, from national, global and local sources, analyses them, and makes sure that those people who need that data get it, either to protect their own systems, or to assist them in carrying out their statutory roles. The NCSC is in regular and frequent communication with international counterparts and there is an ongoing two-way exchange of information.</p>  <p>  The NCSC also supports public bodies, operators of essential services and digital service providers to improve their cyber security posture and fulfil their obligations under the European Network and Information Security Directive. The NCSC takes a very proactive role to supporting these important bodies on their cyber security journey by hosting seminars and workshops for instance.</p></reply>

Data centres are part of the core infrastructure of the digital economy by enabling inter alia data storage, banking and disaster recovery services. They have become increasingly important in the context of remote working during the Covid 19 pandemic and also support high-quality jobs. The Statement also noted that data centres pose considerable challenges to the future planning and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s power system. </p>  <p>  In 2020, data centres represented approximately 11% of the total electricity used in Ireland. EirGrid, in their Generation Capacity Statement 2020-2029, project that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand by 2029 which is significant. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to developing efficiency standards for equipment and processes, particularly those set to grow rapidly, such as data centres. The ICT sector needs to undergo its own green transformation. In addition, EirGrid recently launched a public consultation on 'Shaping our Electricity Future'. The aim is to make the electricity grid stronger and more flexible so that it can carry significantly more renewable generation as well as meet increasing demand from high volume energy users such as data centres. This may include potential geographic restrictions or incentives of large demand customers closer to the generation of power, potentially giving a more regional balance of locations. A consultation on this strategy is open until 14 June and there has been detailed stakeholder engagement on it.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems. It is planned that the review will be completed by the end of 2021. The outcome of the review may inform policy in order to meet future demand from data centres. </p>  <p>Ireland has significant ambitions to ensure that at least 70% of our electricity demand will be met by renewable sources by 2030. This will help supply the growing demand from data centres. In addition, the large multinationals with data centres in Ireland have committed to a global target of being 100% powered by renewable energy by 2025 with some committing to 24/7 renewable energy supply. Under the 2019 Climate Action Plan a Corporate Power Purchase Advisory Group was established to develop options for realising a target of 15% of demand to be met from CPPAs by 2030. The SEAI launched a public consultation on the report which closed on 14 April 2021. Based on the consultation feedback and other considerations, a recommendations paper on a roadmap for CPPAs will be de  veloped later in 2021.</p></reply>

It has statutory responsibility for the State&rsquo;s postal service and the post office network. Decisions relating to the network, including those in relation to the size, distribution and future of the network are operational matters for the Board and management of the company.</p><p>While it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.  As with any business the post office needs to develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for its users.</p><p>Government continues to provide significant business to An Post through the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Social Welfare contract and National Treasury Management Agency business. Government efforts have been focussed on supporting An Post in the roll out of new services and the delivery of its strategic plan. An Post, has been growing its financial services as a key part of its business strategy, building on the significant savings business it has in partnership with the NTMA, its market-leading position in foreign exchange and existing current account, credit card and consumer lending customer base. </p><p>A Capital Expenditure programme was approved at Ministerial level which, as part of the Company&rsquo;s commitment to the sustainability of its network, is designed to develop the newer elements of An Post&rsquo;s Financial Services business and mitigate declining core mail volumes and revenues on the Retail side of the business. &euro;30m in State funding was made available to the company, of which &euro;15 million is to support the renewal of the post office network and a further &euro;15 million towards the continued fulfilment of a five-day per week mail delivery service. Government has faith in the ability of An Post and the postmasters to deliver on that renewal process.</p><p>Government <font color="#000033">is committed to working with  An Post and postmasters  to ensure that the network continues to play a strong role in delivering State services. Government </font>recently approved the Report on the Provision of Offline Government Services and the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Group, co-chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to, <i>inter alia,</i>examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to the post office network. The Group has met twice with a further meeting scheduled in early June and will report back to Government by the end of July.</p><p>All options will be considered fully to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network, while respecting the commercial mandate of An Post.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to a household under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,800 in 2020.   I have secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. Funding for the energy poverty retrofit schemes has also increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,800 homes including 71 homes in Longford and 188 homes in Westmeath on the Warmer Homes work programme. The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months in Longford, Westmeath and nationally. The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme has now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p>  <p>  The SEAI has advised me that the average wait times should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather. </p>  <p>A further &euro;112.5 million will be spent on expanding other existing SEAI residential and community grant schemes and introducing new initiatives. This will support an increased level of retrofit activity   in 2021.</p></reply>

It acts as a central contact point in the event of a government or nation-wide cyber security incident affecting the State. The NCSC also coordinates and supports the response to significant incidents, with the lead role being taken by the entity affected by the incident.   The NCSC team is made up of highly skilled, specialist technical civilian staff, with skillsets in areas such as computer science, software engineering, malware analysis, information technology forensics, cryptography, software development, and cyber security compliance, as well as general cyber security skills. The Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is the team within the NCSC that leads in responding to cyber security incidents. The CSIRT has achieved international accreditation. It is this team that engages with the affected body to support it in addressing a threat.</p>  <p>  Information sharing is a key component of the work of the NCSC whereby it acts a source of expert advice and guidance, but also as a &lsquo;clearing house&rsquo; for information. That is to say it takes in threat intelligence data, trends and risks data, from national, global and local sources, analyses them, and makes sure that those people who need that data get it, either to protect their own systems, or to assist them in carrying out their statutory roles. The NCSC is in regular and frequent communication with international counterparts and the exchange of information is a two-way street.</p>  <p>  The NCSC also supports public bodies, operators of essential services and digital service providers to improve their cyber security posture and fulfil their obligations under the European Network and Information Security Directive. The NCSC takes a very proactive role to supporting these important bodies in continually building their cyber security resilience through a range of initiatives, including by hosting seminars and workshops. In the days following the ransomware attack on the HSE, the NCSC has been providing specific guidance to its constituents, including Government Departments and agencies, together with operators of essential services, on appropriate measures they can take to reduce the risk of further ransomware incidents on their networks. This important element of the work of the NCSC which will continue into the future, will help inform the measures taken by individual organisations, including Government Departments, in securing their network and information systems. </p>  <p>  Recognising that the environment in which the NCSC operates is extremely dynamic, a detailed capacity review of the NCSC is being undertaken to inform Government as to how the NCSC needs to evolve going forward. This capacity review is being carried out by an expert international consultancy and is due to report in the coming weeks in line with the timeline for completion of this work of Q2 2021 set out in the 2019 National Cyber Security Strategy. </p></reply>

The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the areas which will be included in the National Broadband Plan State led intervention as well as areas targeted by commercial operators. The map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map will be served by the new high speed network being delivered by NBI. In order to comply with the State Aid decision which enabled the contract to be awarded, NBI can only serve those premises which have been identified as AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map, as no commercial operator has demonstrated that they will provide a high speed broadband service to these premises. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload.</p>  <p>  The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard as they operate in a fully liberalised market regulated by ComReg as independent regulator.</p>  <p>Complaints about service provision are a matter between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance.

To date, over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme and in 2020 the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was over &euro;14,800.    I have secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. Funding for the energy poverty retrofit schemes has also increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,800 homes on the scheme work programme. This includes homes that: are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting initial survey. The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p>  <p>  The SEAI has advised me that the average wait times should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;112.5 million will be spent on expanding other existing SEAI residential and community grant schemes and introducing new initiatives. This will support an increased level of retrofit activity in 2021. </p></reply>

I am advised by NBI that, as of 27 May 2021, over 220,000 premises across 26 counties have been surveyed. The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected in Carrigaline, Co Cork and Cavan with almost 4,000 premises passed and available for connection. Build works are continuing across the country in 12 Deployment Areas covering townlands in Carrigaline, Ballinasloe, Cavan, Clare, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick Monaghan, Roscommon, Tipperary, Tralee, Wexford and Carlow and "make ready" work is underway in a further 15 Deployment Areas.      While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale, up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract which re-baselines milestone for 2021 to address delays experienced by the NBP rollout, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Department is working closely with NBI to oversee the implementation of the remedial plan and work is continuing to re-baseline the remaining milestones for the remainder of the programme. In parallel, considerations are ongoing in relation to the potential for acceleration of the rollout.</p></reply>

My Department is currently engaging with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout with the aim of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the network build plan. Minister Ryan has recently written to National Broadband Ireland seeking to put the acceleration of the programme on a contractual footing. Any change to the contract will require detailed technical, commercial and financial analysis by both parties. </p><p>NBI has established a dedicated team to investigate the potential for acceleration of the fibre network rollout from its current contracted schedule of seven years. Substantial work has been completed by this team to date including productive engagement with current build partners. It is premature at this point to speculate as to how many premises may benefit from this potential change, but I can say that it will be those premises currently scheduled for the latter end of the rollout that are the focus of the analysis.</p><p>While significant progress has been made by NBI over the last year, in challenging circumstances, the pandemic has caused delays to elements of the programme. A remedial plan to mitigate these delays has been agreed and it is in this context that the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being explored. I expect to receive a detailed assessment from my officials by the Autumn and will then bring an update to Government on this matter. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 6 May, 310 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible locations and the Department of Education for schools. </p><p>My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at </p></reply>

The most recent SEAI data shows that between 12.5% and 13.2% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements in 2020 are expected to have been met from renewable sources. It is expected that 2021 data will be published in 2022.    The 2019 Climate Action Plan sets out a range of policies and measures designed so Ireland can meets it existing 2030 EU emissions reduction climate target. The 2019 Climate Action Plan included commitments for 3.5 GW of offshore wind , up to 8.2 GW of onshore wind and up to 1.5 GW of solar energy by 2030. The Programme for Government commits to a further increase in offshore wind development to 5 GW by 2030. </p>  <p>  The higher level of ambition set in the Climate Action Bill will be reflected through a new set of policies and measures in the 2021 Climate Action Plan.  This will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government target of reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030, meeting the long-term target of climate neutrality by 2050, and to meeting the EU-wide binding target, under the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001, of 32% of the overall share of energy to come from renewable sources by 2030. </p></reply>

On 18 May, the Government approved Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas was published.     </p>  <p>  There was a thorough and comprehensive consideration by my Department of all aspects of regulation and legislation permissible under Irish and EU law in considering the approach taken, in addition to consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. In the context of European Union Treaties and the laws governing the internal energy market, it is considered that a legal ban on the importation of fracked gas could not be put in place at this time.   </p>  <p>  The policy statement commits the Government to work with like-minded European States to promote and support changes to European energy laws in order to allow the importation of fracked gas to be restricted. It also sets out that the Government will work with international partners to promote the phasing out of fracking at an international level within the wider context of the phasing out of fossil fuel extraction.</p></reply>

There is no provision under occupational safety and health legislation to obligate employers to give employees time-off to avail of COVID-19 vaccinations. However, employers should bear in mind that in offering employees time off to facilitate COVID-19 vaccinations they are, in fact, ensuring that the greatest level of workplace safety against COVID-19 can be maintained in their business.  Facilitating workers to avail of COVID-19 vaccination appointments will greatly assist in the recovery of individual businesses and of the wider economy.</p>  <p>  I would encourage employees to engage with their employer in the first instance once they are assigned a vaccination appointment to explore all options available to enable them to receive the vaccination should it fall during working time. I would also encourage all employers to be as flexible and supportive as possible with a view to maintaining good employment relationships over the long term.</p>  <p>  Employers are obliged to take reasonable steps to provide a safe place of work for their staff. In circumstances where employers fail to consider any of the reasonable options, an employee may have recourse to pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2015, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 or the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This will include supporting people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  We have a responsive national skills architecture, which monitors and identifies skills needs across the economy and informs provision for upskilling or reskilling across the education and training system.  The Economic Recovery Plan published today outlines plans to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework and architecture to ensure our skills approach is routed areas of opportunity and growth. This will include a comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s skills strategies and approaches, including the National Skills Strategy 2016-2025; developing a web-based &ldquo;Skills Platform&rdquo;, for upskilling and reskilling opportunities; and developing Ireland&rsquo;s Pact for Skills, between businesses and government, to ensure those with low and no qualifications are not excluded from employment. </p>  <p>  Upskilling and reskilling supports are delivered through a range of education and training programmes informed by this labour market and skills intelligence, which are funded through the National Training Fund.

I have previously met with them, and their representatives, and I have also raised their concerns with one of the primary social media companies, on whose behalf content moderation work is carried out.</p><p>It must be emphasised that there is already, in Ireland, a strong legislative regime to protect all workers in terms of their working conditions, including work-related health and safety, as well as their terms and conditions of employment.</p><p>The suite of workplace health and safety legislation is designed to prevent and mitigate against work-related accidents and injuries. Social media content moderators should be treated by an employer in the same way as any other worker potentially exposed to work related hazards. This means that the employer must ensure that appropriate training is provided and must carry out a robust risk assessment with a particular focus on the potential hazards arising from work activities. Where a particular hazard is identified that may require subsequent monitoring it must be included in the written Safety Statement, and the relevant worker must be made aware of the hazard and the associated monitoring that is in place.</p><p>I would also point out that there is provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, to ensure that an employer cannot penalise, or threaten to penalise, an employee who makes a complaint or a representation on any matter relating to health and safety at work. Any worker concerned for their health and safety can contact the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s Workplace Contact Unit in confidence.</p><p>While the Health and Safety Authority is independent in the carrying out of investigations into complaints that it receives, I am aware that the Health and Safety Authority continues to engage with the Social Media sector to reiterate their duties under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and to establish what control measures are in place to address the risks arising from the specific nature of the work of content moderators. On assessing the control measures the Health and Safety Authority will be able to determine whether further advice or guidance is necessary for employers and employees in that sector.</p><p>In addition, employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on a contract of service basis. Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights they can bring a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) which is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation. The WRC can be contacted at .</p><p>Non-Disclosure Agreements should not and cannot be used to prevent content moderators from raising issues of concern around their working conditions and/or health and safety concerns. We have robust legislative protection for all workers in Ireland who wish to raise legitimate concerns without repercussion.</p><p>Separately, I would add that my colleague, Catherine Martin TD, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, is currently advancing a regulatory framework which will deal with on-line safety and which will include the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner.</p></reply>

As we start to reopen the economy, the Government has agreed to the extension of the CRSS until 30th   of June 2021.</p>  <p>  Any business currently availing of CRSS and that can now reopen as restrictions are eased will be able to avail of double restart week payments for two weeks subject to the statutory maximum of &euro;5,000 per week to support them in meeting the costs of reopening as they exit the scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department has made loan supports available to businesses that have been impacted by COVID-19. These include schemes to support businesses as they look toward reopening.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Business Loan provides up to &euro;25,000 to eligible micro-enterprises through Microfinance Ireland with zero repayments and zero interest for the first six months and the equivalent of an additional six-months interest-free, subject to certain terms and conditions. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme makes lending available from participating lenders to eligible businesses. Loans available under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million and are for terms of up to three years. Loans are offered at favourable terms, including a maximum interest rate of 4% and no security on loans of up to &euro;500,000.  This scheme is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees).</p>  <p>  The Government are committed that there will be no cliff-edge end to the economic supports at the end of June. Government recognises that re-opening will be costly and will pose new challenges that will need to be sustained by continued supports and corrective measures to get the balance right between supporting recovery and cost to the Exchequer and plans for this are currently in development. Details on these supports will be announced as part of our National Economic Recovery Plan which will be published in early June.</p></reply>

The Request for Tender was published on the eTenders website and in the Official Journal of the European Union in December 2019. Five bids were received for the tender and following evaluation by the selection committee from my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the contract was awarded to Implement Consulting Group. The value of this contract is &euro;199,500 plus VAT.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that this particular Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment consists of two important and complementary components, namely a comprehensive analysis of the potential economic benefits as well as a robust sustainability impact assessment including social, human rights and environmental impacts that the Trade Agreement could have in Ireland and the Mercosur countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. As such, it is a considerable undertaking, which, unfortunately, has necessitated us running beyond the Q1 2021 deadline by which we had hoped to have the finalised report considered by Government and published.</p>  <p>  As previously reported to the House, the detailed research and stakeholder consultations are concluded, and I have been informed that drafting of the actual Report itself is well advanced such that the Report is expected to be received by my Department in the coming weeks. It will be published as soon as possible after consideration by Government.</p></reply>

However, it does not set targets for individual sectors or types of emissions.   In this regard, the Bill provides for the Climate Change Advisory Council to devise and propose a series of 5-year carbon budgets. These budgets will define a pathway to meet Ireland's national emissions targets. When these budgets are approved, the Government will then set sectoral emissions ceilings based on the budgets and devise Climate Action Plans to implement the budgets.</p>  <p>   In this way, the targets for individual sectors and types of emissions will take account of the most recent national greenhouse gas emissions inventory and projections, prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency; relevant scientific advice, including the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane; international best practice on the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals and, in so far as practicable, the need to maximise employment, the attractiveness of the State for investment and the long term competitiveness of the economy.

A prospecting licence relates to the activity of prospecting (exploring) for minerals and does not, if granted, give a licence holder permission to mine. All prospecting licence applications, including renewals, are subject to public consultation giving all stakeholders and local communities an opportunity to make an input.   Where a licence holder seeks to have a licence renewed, the application is evaluated by the Geoscience Regulation Office of my Department. Where renewal is proposed, a renewal offer is made to the holder, setting out the terms and area of the prospecting licence. If the holder accepts the offer, legislation requires 21 days&rsquo; public notice of the Minister&rsquo;s intention to renew a prospecting licence and for the receipt of any submissions. In practice the Minister allows for a 30 days&rsquo; notice period. Notification is given through a printed notice in the newspaper that is most relevant to the prospecting licence area under consideration. The Minister&rsquo;s Intention to Grant Notices is also sent for public display to the appropriate Garda station(s), local authority office(s) and the Geological Survey Ireland. </p>  <p>  Additional information on the process of granting prospecting licences and making submissions is available online on my Department's website.</p></reply>

This is consistent with the 2012 Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure which states: &lsquo;The Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and ESB Networks or other energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies&rsquo;. Planning conditions for particular projects are a matter for the relevant planning authority.   EirGrid's role as the designated Transmission System Operator (TSO) includes the operation, maintenance and development of the electricity transmission network in Ireland. EirGrid's expenditure in this role is regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) through a five year price control review process. ESB Networks is the Transmission Asset Owner and, under direction from EirGrid, it carries out all of the relevant tendering and procurement processes taking into account compliance with planning conditions arising from the consenting process in Ireland. </p>  <p>  EirGrid is carrying out a public consultation on &ldquo;Shaping our Electricity Future&rdquo; and is engaging with communities and stakeholders across Ireland on improving the electricity grid and making it more flexible so that it can carry more renewable generation in the future. EirGrid&rsquo;s consultation aligns with Ireland&rsquo;s existing strategy to further reduce carbon emissions from the electricity sector which will be updated in this year&rsquo;s revision to the Climate Action Plan.</p></reply>

To date, over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, and the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household in 2020 was over &euro;14,800.    I have secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. Funding for the energy poverty retrofit schemes has also increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,800 homes on the scheme work programme. 782 of these homes are in Cork. This includes homes that: are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting initial survey. The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion for homes in Cork and nationally was approximately 18 months. The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p>  <p>  The SEAI has advised me that the average wait times should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p>  <p>  The SEAI has established a panel of contractors to deliver the installation of energy efficiency measures in eligible homes nationwide under the scheme. There are 33 contractors on this panel including 4 contractors that have their businesses based in Cork. All contractors can deliver measures nationwide as per the requirements of appointment to the panel. </p>  <p>  A further &euro;112.5 million will be spent on expanding other existing SEAI residential and community grant schemes and introducing new initiatives. This will support an increased level of retrofit activity in 2021. </p></reply>

The Government recognises that the NBP will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged in the Programme for Government particularly around increased levels of remote working and remote service delivery and adapting to an evolving economy and competing internationally. </p><p>Despite the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan. I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that as at the 27 May over 220,000 premises have been surveyed across all counties. </p><p>This survey work has enabled detailed designs to be developed for each deployment area. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence.</p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected in Carrigaline, Co Cork and Cavan with almost 4,000 premises passed and available for connection to date. Premises in Galway and Limerick are expected to be available for connection in the coming months. I am advised that build works are continuing across the country in 12 deployment areas covering townlands in Carrigaline, Ballinasloe, Cavan, Clare, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick Monaghan, Roscommon, Tipperary, Tralee, Wexford and Carlow. In addition, &quot;make ready&quot; work is underway in a further 15 Deployment Areas.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 27th May, 317 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. </p><p>My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP.

The NRRP will enable us to move beyond the pandemic and to invest in the future in key areas such as climate action and the digital transition. Two projects from my Department were selected for inclusion in the under NRRP Priority 1: Advancing the Green Transition: </p>  <p>  (i)Derisking a Low-Cost Residential Retrofit Loan Scheme; and </p>  <p>  (ii) Enhanced Rehabilitation of Bord na Mona Peatlands previously harvested for commercial purposes </p>  <p>  In addition, under this Priority, Ireland is committed to implementing reforms by progressing the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021. </p>  <p>  These projects will support actions in respect of the climate and environmental priorities of the Union and the &lsquo;do no significant harm&rsquo; principle, and contribute to achieving the 2030 climate and energy targets and climate neutrality by 2050, as well as other environmental goals. The draft Plan will now undergo a formal assessment by the European Commission before being submitted to the Council of the European Union.</p></reply>

From this, detailed designs are then drawn up and thereafter the necessary build work can commence.  Once NBI have settled on designs on how the network will be built in a particular area, these plans are submitted to the relevant local authority in order to obtain the necessary licences or permissions that may apply, for example with respect to road opening, or Section 254 licences which apply to certain developments exempt from planning.  Given the scale of the NBP rollout there is significant engagement by NBI with all the local authorities.  With this in mind a number of stakeholders collaborated recently to publish a Guidance document on the <i>Process of Engagement between NBI and the Local Authorities on the Application for Section 254 Licences</i>. Last month Minister Ryan addressed a webinar for representatives of all local authorities to launch the guidance document. Speaking at the webinar, Minister Ryan stressed the importance of effective and timely consent processes to ensure that the NBP network is deployed as early as possible to support individuals and businesses in rural Ireland and commended  the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), the County &amp;amp; City Management Association (CCMA), the Road Management Office (RMO) and NBI for their collaboration in developing the guidance document.</p></reply>

To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme and in 2020 the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was over &euro;14,800. </p>  <p>  I have secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. Funding for the energy poverty retrofit schemes has also increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p>  <p>  The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector.</p>  <p>  There are nearly 8,000 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme.  These homes have not previously received any free upgrades under the scheme and for that reason are the priority to receive upgrades.  Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need are being developed and I anticipate that they will be finalised shortly. </p></reply>

These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, including agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. For the year 2020, the target set for Ireland was that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. The 2020 greenhouse gas emissions estimates report, published by the EPA in January 2021, indicates that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be 8% below 2005 levels by 2020. According to this report, Ireland will cumulatively exceed the carbon budget implied by our ESD targets by 11-12Mt and will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Pre-COVID19 estimates of the additional costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with these targets were in the region of &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.</p><p>Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to an annual average 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade), while our current 2030 EU target is a 30% emissions reduction by 2030. The European Commission will publish their &ldquo;Fit for 55&rdquo; package this July, which is expected to propose higher EU targets for all Member States, including Ireland, in line with the new EU ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. </p><p>While Irish agriculture has a positive international reputation in terms of producing high quality, sustainable produce, emissions from the agri-food sector have continued to increase. The long-term challenge for the sector is to achieve carbon neutrality, while not compromising our capacity for sustainable food production. The Government is committed to finding the balance between environmental, climate and biodiversity needs, and supports for farmers.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2019 includes a range of policy and measures to be delivered in order to ensure we meet our existing EU targets. My Department launched a public consultation in March 2021 to inform the Climate Action Plan 2021, and to identify additional policies and measures necessary to meet the Programme for Government ambition. </p><p>As well as developing the next Climate Action Plan, we are evaluating the potential climate contributions from land use improvements, to set in train the development of a land-use strategy. Land-use offers significant potential to sequester additional carbon and may provide a new source of family farm income and rural economic benefit.</p><p>We recognise the interlinked role the agriculture and agri-food sectors have with the waste sector and are also committed to supporting the agri-food sector to evolve Ireland&rsquo;s capability as a leader in circular economies. We are investing in research in the agri-food sector to prioritise investment in climate and the bio-economy and will implement the National Policy Statement on the Bio-economy, providing the agri-food sector with new opportunities using biological resources in a sustainable and circular manner. </p><p>With the correct policy choices in the agriculture sector, we can reward farmers for sequestering carbon, restoring biodiversity, improving water and air quality, producing clean energy, and developing schemes that support results-based outcomes. In the Climate Action Plan 2021, far reaching policy changes will be developed across every sector that set us on the path of systemic change that is required for Ireland to become a climate-neutral and climate-resilient society and economy by 2050 at the latest.</p></reply>

These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  The Effort Sharing Decision allows Member States to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets.    The 2020 greenhouse gas emissions estimates report published by the EPA in January 2021 indicates that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be 8% below 2005 levels by 2020. According to this report, Ireland will cumulatively exceed the carbon budget implied by our ESD targets by 11 to 12Mt and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with these targets were in the region of &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.</p>  <p>  As a follow up to the ESD, the EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets binding emission reduction targets for Member States for the period 2021-2030. The final agreement sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. It is important to recognise that this target will be amended following the European Commission&rsquo;s plan to increase ambition from its existing EU wide 2030 target of 40% reduction to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by July this year, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering this ambition, which will more than halve our carbon emissions over the course of the decade. With the increased scale and depth of this ambition, new strategies will be needed to sustain a reduction trajectory that will increase over time. I am working with colleagues across Government to develop a new Climate Action Plan, with additional initiatives in every sector to bring about the significant change needed to transform our society. The Climate Action Plan will require annual revisions to address the need for intensive and regular monitoring and updating of policy actions to ensure we remain on track and within our emission limits, and will act as a further review mechanism and opportunity to adjust and refocus actions, as required.</p>  <p>  In line with EU ambition, Ireland has committed to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. This objective will be set in law by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021, which was published on 23 March 2021. The Bill will support Ireland&rsquo;s transition to net zero and achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050. It will establish a legally binding framework with clear targets and commitments set in law, and ensure the necessary structures and processes are embedded on a statutory basis to ensure we achieve our national, EU and international climate goals and obligations in the near and long term.</p></reply>

To assist in meeting this target, Ireland set a national target of achieving 40% of electricity produced from renewable sources.</p><p>In 2019, 36.5% of electricity in Ireland was generated from renewable sources, based on the calculation methodology set out in the Renewable Energy Directive, compared to 15.6% in 2010. Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provisional figures for 2020 show 38.9% of electricity in Ireland was generated from renewable sources.</p><p>More information on Ireland's renewable energy use can be found in the SEAI report <i>Energy in Ireland 2020 </i>which is available at www.seai.ie. The Energy in Ireland report is updated on an annual basis and published in the last quarter of the year. Information on energy use for the year 2020 may be found in the 2020 Provisional Energy Balance, which is also available on the Authority's website.</p><p>EirGrid's Generation Capacity Statement, which is published annually, sets out the expected levels of electricity generation and demand for each year over the coming decade.  EirGrid is also currently undertaking a 'Shaping our Electricity Future' consultation across the three dimensions of electricity networks, power system operation, and electricity markets with the aim of developing an integrated vision of the 2030 power system and electricity market. The draft strategy comprises four approaches to achieving this, as well as meeting the projected increased demand for electricity over the coming years.</p><p>The Programme for Government 2020 sets a target of at least a 70% renewable share in electricity production by 2030. This will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government target of reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030, meeting the long-term target of climate neutrality by 2050, and to meeting the EU-wide binding target, under the recast Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001, of 32% of the overall share of energy to come from renewable sources by 2030.</p></reply>

All monitoring stations collect air quality data for a range of pollutants in order to provide information to the public, and for assessment against European legal limit values and World Health Organisation guideline values. Real-time data from these monitoring stations is available online at all times at www.airquality.ie, and the most recent report on Ireland&rsquo;s air quality can be found at .</p><p>The data being generated through the AAMP confirms that air quality in Ireland is generally good, and compares favourably with other European countries. While significant reductions in emissions have already been achieved through a range of policy measures, as more comprehensive, real-time, localised air quality information becomes available, it is apparent that there are key pollutants which still need to be addressed more comprehensively.</p><p>Particulate matter, from the burning of solid fuel, is estimated to cause 1,300 premature deaths per year in Ireland, and I am committed to addressing this public health and environmental challenge through a nationwide ban on smoky coal and enhanced regulation of other solid fuels. </p><p>The recent public consultation on a new solid fuel regulation for Ireland was the first step in this process. It is my intention to move now to develop a new, legally robust, and evidence-based framework for how we regulate all solid fuels used for domestic burning. This will be a central plank of Ireland&rsquo;s first National Clean Air Strategy which will also identify and promote the integrated measures and actions across Government required to reduce air pollution, which I intend to publish shortly.</p></reply>

No. 419 of 2007 Waste Management (Shipments of Waste) Regulations, 2007. These Regulations give effect to Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1013/2006 on transfrontier shipments of waste, which sets out notification procedures, specifies waste listings and strengthens enforcement provisions in relation to waste movements within, into and out of the European Union. The Waste Shipment Regulation is also the legislative instrument that implements the EUs obligations under related international conventions, including the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste, to which Ireland is a signatory. </p><p>Provisions of the Waste Shipment Regulation require that all exports of waste from the European Union &ldquo;destined for disposal shall be prohibited&rsquo;. Similarly, in terms of meeting our EU waste reduction targets, S.I. No. 323/2020 - European Union (Waste Directive) Regulations 2020 provides that waste collected in Ireland and exported to another EU Member State for the purposes of preparing for re-use, recycling or backfilling in that other Member State may be counted towards the attainment of the targets in Ireland. </p><p>Waste exported from the European Union may also be counted towards the attainment of national targets, providing that the exporter can prove that the shipped waste is treated in equivalent conditions to that required in the European Union. </p><p>It is therefore important for Ireland to ensure that exported waste is appropriately accounted for. The enforcement and monitoring of shipments of waste to and from Ireland is maintained by the National Transfrontier Shipments Office (NTFSO) within Dublin City Council, which monitors and enforces these requirements and maintains statistics and information on shipments of waste to and from Ireland.</p></reply>

This strategy, when finalised, will set out the high-level directions we need to take to make our transition to a circular economy possible.The first iteration of the Strategy is not intended to be an action plan but does reflect specific targets already set and actions already being taken. Subsequent versions of the Strategy will incorporate additional actions and targets, including sector specific targets for those sectors within the Irish economy that have the potential to make significant contributions to the circular transition including, <i>inter alia</i>, construction, agriculture, circular design and manufacture, repair, digital services and textiles. These specific actions and targets will be delivered through a range of mechanisms, potentially including through the development of standalone Sectoral Circular Economy Roadmaps. Each new version of the Strategy is also likely to be supplemented by additional thematic analyses of specific sectors and/or activities, such as the scope for embedding circular practices within resource intensive sectors, or the potential for digital services and novel manufacturing techniques to &lsquo;design-out&rsquo; waste.It is anticipated that the Strategy will be updated in full every 18 months to 2 years.</p></reply>

Under the Climate Action Plan, a Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is developing an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments. The proposed support mechanism was outlined in a public consultation launched in January (now closed) and the submissions received are currently being reviewed. While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive.  </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published an updated Roadmap for the Clean Energy Package&rsquo;s Electricity and Renewables Directives in February, which provides for a public consultation on the regulatory framework for prosumer development later this year.</p></reply>

This is to ensure that funding is targeted most effectively at those who might not otherwise buy an electric vehicle and where the availability of Government support is most likely impact upon a decision to purchase an EV. </p><p>As well as the purchase grant scheme, there is a significant range of other supports to incentivise the take-up of electric vehicles, including:</p><p>-Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) relief of up to &euro;5,000 for battery electric vehicles and low rates of VRT for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;</p><p>- Benefit-in-kind tax relief for battery electric vehicles;</p><p>- Grant support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600;</p><p>- Lowest rate of motor tax (&euro;120 per annum) for battery electric vehicles and generally low rates of motor tax for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; and</p><p>- A discount on tolls of 50% for battery electric vehicles and 25% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (up to a maximum amount of &euro;500 per year with greater reductions off-peak on the M50).</p><p>- Grants of up to &euro;12,500 to support the purchase of electric vehicles in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector</p><p>- &euro;15 million to support taxi and hackney drivers in scrapping their older vehicles and replacing them with electric alternatives.</p><p>- Accelerated Capital Allowances for businesses;</p><p>Over the coming years, we will see through the combination of improvements in technology, reductions in vehicle purchase prices, increasing driving ranges and model availabilities from manufacturers, as well as Government incentives and new investment in the recharging network, a further boost to the current positive policy environment under which electric vehicle sales are rising steeply year on year.</p></reply>

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) will reopen its network of test centres and will be permitted to carry out 25,000 driver theory tests per month.</p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, the RSA provided 15,000 tests per month. In light of the significant backlog of customers, the RSA will gradually increase capacity in its test centres to 25,000 tests a month. </p>  <p>  The test centres have extensive COVID-19 measures in place to protect both customers and staff and to ensure the safe delivery of the service. It is hoped that capacity will gradually increase to 50,000 tests per month over time, if public health guidance permits. </p>  <p>  The RSA has been working to deliver an online theory test service, with a pilot online test already underway for trucks and buses. This pilot service has now been extended to include a limited number of car and motorbike tests.  </p>  <p>  The new offering will see 4,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles per month. Tests are available on a &lsquo;first come, first served&rsquo; basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. Once the online service is established, all customers will be able to opt to do the test online.</p></reply>

Elements of the AEC are currently on the TEN-T core and comprehensive network, though the AEC as a concept was never included on the TEN-T network.</p><p>In April 2019, the European Commission commenced the review of the TEN-T network with an evaluation of the existing TEN-T Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013. The main objectives for the Commission in revising the TEN-T Regulation are to:</p><p>- Ensure the completion of the core network by 2030 and comprehensive network by 2050;  </p><p>- Make the EU's transport systems green, digital and resilient; and  </p><p>- Reinforce the infrastructure standards and quality requirements across the network.</p><p>In August 2019, my predecessor, Minister Ross, made a submission to the European Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, regarding the review. While preparing this submission there was significant engagement between my Department and the AEC Taskforce to ensure the views of the AEC were incorporated.</p><p>The submission outlined significant national developments since the TEN-T Regulation came into force in 2013, particularly the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan, and the implications of Brexit on Ireland's international connectivity. The submission requested that consideration be given by the European Commission to including the Atlantic Economic Corridor region of Ireland on the core network, fulfilling a commitment in the 2016 Programme for Government.</p><p>A copy of that submission, and Commissioner Bulc&rsquo;s reply, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/3c921e-submission-to-commissioner-bulc-for-a-revision-of-the-core-ten-t-net/</i></p><p>As part of the review, the Commission is analysing the extent to which the existing Regulation is still fit for purpose and considering what adjustments, if any, may be required to address any new challenges in the European transport sector. There are a number of guiding principles for the Review, one of which is that the planning methodology, used for the design of the network adopted in 2013 remain unchanged. The Commission is expected therefore to only consider slight network adjustments on the basis of this methodology when justified through specific developments.</p><p>My Department is participating fully in the review process, engaging directly with the European Commission on a number of occasions (most recently on 19 May 2021), in order to ensure that any amendment to or revision of the TEN-T Regulation recognises the concerns of Ireland and the national policy developments that have occurred since the Regulation came into force in 2013. My Department will arrange a further bilateral with the Commission in September.</p><p>I expect the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal reviewing the TEN-T Regulation in Q4 2021, based on an impact assessment which is due for publication in Q3 2021.</p><p>In the meantime, I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Commission&rsquo;s Staff Working Document on the TEN-T Guidelines evaluation which was published on 26 May 2021 and which is available on the Commission&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i>ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/1908-Trans-European-Transport-Network-TEN-T-Guidelines-evaluation_en</i></p></reply>

Government supports for the airports, airlines and companies in the aviation sector have been provided throughout this crisis. By the end of June 2021, the sector will have received approx. &euro;300 million in State funding spanning employment supports, waiver of commercial rates and deferral of taxes. The bulk of the support to airlines is through the TWSS/EWSS wage subsidy schemes which were specifically designed to maintain the link between employers and employees. Liquidity support has also been made available by ISIF to large aviation enterprises.</p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically for Irish aviation in 2021. As part of this package, &euro;21 million is being provided under the Regional Airports Programme (2021-2025) this year.  This gives funding certainty to Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airports and also supports the PSO services on the Donegal/ Dublin and Kerry/Dublin air routes. In addition, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon airports through a new one-year Covid-19 regional State airports programme. A &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by Covid-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. The scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and make a recovery from the impacts of Covid-19.</p></reply>

I welcomed the announcement of increased thresholds under the existing Cycle to Work Scheme as part of the 2020 July Stimulus package, as well as the expansion of the scheme to electric bikes. The changes to the Scheme are in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The use of e-bikes is proving to be an increasingly popular method of travel, whether for commuting or leisure purposes, and is encouraging more people to choose to cycle. Bearing this in mind, and referencing the commitment by the Government to increase funding to active travel, all potential incentives to potential purchasers of bikes and e-bikes will be taken into consideration moving forward.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to widening the eligibility of the Bike to Work Scheme and my Department, in cooperation with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will be examining ways in which to do this so that bikes and e-bikes are available and affordable to as many of our citizens as possible. </p>  <p>  I was delighted to recently take an initial step towards this with the launch of the Pilot Bike and e-Bike Upcycling Initiative in partnership with the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD). This  three-year pilot scheme will see high quality up-cycled bicycles and e-bikes provided at a lower cost to those on low incomes and/or those who are most marginalised and disadvantaged. My Department will provide &euro;1 million per annum towards this initiative for its duration, while Pobal will administer the scheme through DRCD's Community Services Programme. The deadline for applications was 28th May 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be aware that my Department is in the process of preparing a new Sustainable Mobility Policy following public consultation last year. This new policy framework will provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme, including active travel, and I look forward to the completion of this important work in 2021. The issue of widening the eligibility of the Bike to Work scheme will be explored as part of this policy document.</p></reply>

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) will reopen its network of test centres and will be permitted to conduct 25,000 driver theory tests per month.</p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, the RSA provided 15,000 tests per month. In light of the significant backlog of customers, the RSA will gradually increase capacity in its test centres to 25,000 tests a month. </p>  <p>  The test centres have extensive COVID-19 measures in place to protect both customers and staff and to ensure the safe delivery of the service. It is hoped that capacity will gradually increase to 50,000 tests per month over time, if public health guidance permits. </p>  <p>  The RSA has been working to deliver an online theory test service, with a pilot online test already underway for trucks and buses. This pilot service has now been extended to include a limited number of car and motorbike tests.  </p>  <p>  The new offering will see 4,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles per month. Tests are available on a &lsquo;first come, first served&rsquo; basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. Once the online service is established, all customers will be able to opt to do the test online. </p>  <p>  Driving tests for essential workers will continue to be the priority for the driver testing service. In line with the gradual reopening of services, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest will recommence in a limited fashion. </p>  <p>  My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to meet the growing demand for tests.  An additional 40 driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. The RSA is making good progress in recruiting these additional testers and they are expected to conduct tests by the end of June 2021. </p>  <p>  The Department and the RSA will monitor what impact the new testers are having as they come on stream and as the Covid restriction level reduces. Further recruitment, if necessary, will take place.  </p>  <p>  The health of both the public and the testers themselves must take priority, and as a result it is important to recognise that it will take time to get driver testing waiting times back to normal pre-Covid levels.</p></reply>

A public road, other than one classified  as a national road or a regional road, is a local road.</p>  <p>  Roads classified as regional or local roads fall under the responsibility of local authorities. The construction, repair and maintenance of these roads is funded by local authorities&rsquo; own resources supplemented by State grants.</p>  <p>  Requests to classify a road as a national road or regional road are considered, in consultation with TII as appropriate.  Criteria for consideration are numerous and include items such as function of road including access to towns and Cities, major ports and airports, geographical regions, population centres and tourist regions.  It also includes considerations of continuity of classification throughout the length of road, whether roads are feeder connections or links to the national road network, cross section, alignment and structural integrity as well as amount of heavy commercial vehicles.  Funding source for road improvement is not a consideration of classification of road type.</p>  <p>  The Department carries out periodic reviews of classifications and these proposals, in relation to the L5433 and the R444, will be considered as part of the next such review.

This is a project set out in the existing, statutory, Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 to 2036 and one which has been subject to extensive, non-statutory public consultation over the last 3 years. This project has now reached an important milestone as its Preliminary Business Case has been submitted to my Department for review as is required under the Public Spending Code. For projects of this scale, the Public Spending Code stipulates that Government approval is required to allow the project submit its Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Preliminary Business Case has been developed on the basis of the existing project as has been subject to public consultation in recent years.</p>  <p>  Secondly, we have the statutory review of the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area. The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 stipulates that the Strategy must be reviewed every six years and this review provides an opportunity to re-examine and re-consider proposals for inclusion in the revised Strategy. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has stated that as part of its review it is considering whether additional metro routes should be included in any revised Strategy. It has further stated that as part of the public consultation process all background studies conducted to assist with this consideration will be published and I understand this public consultation phase will commence in the coming months. </p>  <p>I think it important to also note that inclusion in any revised Strategy is the first step in what is a very detailed process to enable projects move from the strategic support enabled by inclusion in a Transport Strategy to being a project with a Preliminary Business Case seeking approval to enter the statutory planning process.   </p></reply>

The subsequent reduction in the person&rsquo;s LPT valuation in 2021 meant that both 2013 and 2015 were consequently overpaid. However, these amounts are not repayable, in accordance with section 26(2)(b) of the Finance (Local) Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), because the valuation was changed more than four-years after the end of the relevant tax years.</p>  <p>  Revenue is engaging directly with the person in the context of his overall LPT liability, including in respect of interest charges and his entitlement to a deferral of LPT.  </p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.  </p>  <p>  The objective of the EWSS is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.29 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;540 million have been granted to 49,500 employers in respect of some 570,000 workers.</p>  <p>  Other members of the Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware, the scheme is currently scheduled to run until the end of this month. The COVID Restrictions Support Scheme has been similarly extended. </p>  <p>  On many occasions over recent months, I have indicated to the House in responses to questions from Deputies that consideration was being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.</p>  <p>  Subject to the deliberations of Government, the Deputy may expect to hear further details today in this regard in relation to the EWSS. </p>  <p>  I can also assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to assess matters as we move forward with the reopening of the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic as far as possible.</p></reply>

In order to help further meet these goals, I announced an enhancement to the existing scheme with effect from 23 July 2020 for the remainder of that year as part of the July Stimulus Package. The legislation to give effect to this is set out in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020.  Finance Act 2020 further extended the period of application of the enhanced levels of support until 31 December 2021.   </p>  <p>  In relation to second-hand properties generally, an increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. As mentioned above, the HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for affordable new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the relief would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply. I have no plans to extend HTB to second-hand properties.</p></reply>

An IREF is an investment fund, or a sub-fund, which derives 25% or more of its market value from assets acquiring their value directly or indirectly from real estate in the State. </p><p>As an investment undertaking, the profits of the IREF are not taxed within the fund, but instead are subject to tax in the hands of the investors. IREFs are subject to a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. Irish resident individuals/corporates are subject to investment undertakings tax. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place.</p><p>The legislation governing the taxation of IREFs provides that an investor resident in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement (DTA) may reclaim any excess withholding tax incurred above the rate specified in the relevant DTA where the investor owns less than 10% of the units in an IREF. The table below sets out details of the number and value of reclaims processed by Revenue up to the period ended 30 April 2021. The reclaims processed total &euro;3,319,159. The bulk of the repayments relate to IREF WHT deducted in the tax period ended 31 December 2019.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Date of repayment</th>       <th>Number of reclaims</th>       <th>Amount of reclaims &euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>&amp;lt;10 </td>       <td>2,521,414 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>34 </td>       <td>773,538 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&amp;lt;10 </td>       <td>24,207 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The gross amount of IREF WHT arising and paid for the periods 2017, 2018 and 2019 were previously provided to the Deputy and are set out in the following table.   <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2017 &euro; </th>       <th>2018 &euro; </th>       <th>2019 &euro; </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IREF Withholding   Tax paid</td>       <td>8,321,359 </td>       <td>28,229,097 </td>       <td>65,759,048 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Income tax charge paid*</td>       <td>n/a </td>       <td>n/a </td>       <td>6,211,720 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*The Finance Act 2019 contained a number of anti-avoidance measures for IREFs. IREFs are regarded as having income subject to income tax where they have excessive debt or expenses that are not wholly or exclusively for the purpose of their business. For the three-month period to 31 December 2019, &euro;6.2 million income tax was paid by IREFs. </p><p>In respect of question 29148/21, Section 19 of Finance Act 2017 removed the exemption referred to by the Deputy in respect of disposals occurring on or after 1 January 2019.  It is not possible to estimate the amount of IREF withholding tax paid in 2019 directly attributable to the removal of this exemption, as this would have required taxpayers to declare information no longer relevant in filing their tax returns - i.e. to advise if a gain would have been excluded if it had arisen in a prior year.I can however advise that in 2019, no IREF indicated on the returns filed that it had availed of the exclusion of profits in respect of a profit distribution arising from a property sale. </p></reply>

The stamp duty liability that might arise in respect of a particular development would have regard to the particular facts and circumstances of each transaction. In addition, any potential stamp duty liability that might arise in the circumstances of the case in question would not appear to be directly relevant to the requester, so the issue of taxpayer confidentiality also arises for Revenue. </p>  <p>  In relation to the recent Financial Resolution passed by the D&aacute;il on May 19 last, I can confirm that  a new higher rate of 10% stamp duty applies under section 31E of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 in situations where 10 or more residential units, excluding apartments (as defined), but including duplex units and terraced town houses, are acquired in any 12-month period.  For the purposes of section 31E, an apartment is defined as a residential unit in a multi-storey residential property that comprises, or will comprise, not less than 3 apartments with grouped or common access. It will be a question of fact in each case whether the residential units concerned come within this definition.</p>  <p>  Stamp duty is payable by the purchaser or by a lessee in a long lease with a term of at least 35 years. While it is not clear who might be acquiring the residential units in question following their refurbishment, it should be noted that local authorities and certain approved housing bodies purchasing or leasing residential units are exempt from stamp duty so the threshold of 10 residential units would not be relevant to them. </p></reply>

I share the widespread concerns that the activity of these institutional investors risks distorting the market for houses in the State and I recognise the difficulties that this has the potential to cause for first time buyers and others who wish to buy a family home. </p>  <p>  I indicated at that time that as some multiple purchases of property are undertaken by bodies specifically for the purpose of providing social or affordable housing, the higher stamp duty rate will not apply in such instances e.g.  Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, and the Housing Agency. I also pointed out that other social or affordable housing arrangements would be considered as part of the legislation which will be brought before the Houses in the next few weeks to permanently underpin this Financial Resolution. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputies specific question about whether  private sector participants in the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme  will be  exempted from the new higher stamp duty rate, I have been advised by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  that he wishes such an exemption to be provided for as part of the legislation required to put the stamp duty Financial Resolution on a permanent statutory footing. </p>  <p>  Finally, my officials have been in contact with a major private sector  participant and it is understood that the addressing of this matter through legislation over the next number of weeks should ensure that current mortgage to rent transactions are concluded satisfactorily. </p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee and was introduced in 2009.</p>  <p>  The scheme operates on a self-administration basis.

The fixed amount can vary from year to year. The Levy operates in accordance with section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, and has been paid into the REF since 2013. The REF received &euro;752 million from Revenue in respect of the duty in 2019 and &euro;771million in 2020. </p><p>Ireland supports its community rated system by providing age related health credits to insurers in respect of older people and less healthy people, to help meet the expected higher cost of health insurance for this group. As a result, all people pay the same premiums net of these tax credits for their health insurance, so helping to prevent insurers cherry-picking younger customers who are less likely to get sick. These tax credits are funded by the health insurance levy which is collected by insurers as part of the annual premium of policy holders.  They then pay it to Revenue, and it is then transferred to the REF.</p><p>Risk equalisation credits are paid out of the REF to the insurers by the Authority. Any surpluses or deficits in the REF are carried forward and allowed for in setting future levy amounts. </p><p>The annual Health Insurance (Amendment) Act sets out the risk equalisation credits and Stamp Duty levy applicable for the following 12 month (1 April to 31 March) period. The level of Stamp Duty to be applied to advanced and non-advanced products for adults and children is then calculated on that basis by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), and is also provided for in that Act.</p><p>For example, in November 2020 the Minister for Health accepted the HIA's recommendation to leave the levy unchanged for the coming 12 month period, i.e. 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022). The rates currently in effect are shown in the table below. </p><p>HIA contracts effective 1 April 2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>From 1 April 2021</th>       <th>Non-advanced health insurance contracts</th>       <th>Advanced health insurance contracts</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17 and under </td>       <td>&euro;52</td>       <td>&euro;150</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>18 and over </td>       <td>&euro;157</td>       <td>&euro;449 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I therefore have no plans to revisit the charging of the levy, and as my reply notes, the rate at which it is charged is determined by the Minister for Health each year, on foot of advice from the HIA, and not by the Minister for Finance.  </p></reply>

The scheme terminated on 30 April.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 65,661 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 26 May 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;10,762,518, and the potential tax cost is &euro;2,152,504, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time last year when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.   </p>  <p>  While I am very mindful of the significant difficulties that remain to be faced by the hospitality sector, I made the determination that the broad interests of taxpayers would not have been best served by extending the scheme over the summer months in circumstances where most will be staying at home and hopefully holidaying in Ireland. This is particularly the case when other very significant support measures will remain in place.  </p>  <p>  Currently, I do not have plans to re-introduce the Stay and Spend scheme.   However, it may be useful to highlight and summarise the significant supports that remain available to support businesses in the hospitality sector:</p>  <p>  - In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary but important measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity. It will apply until 31 December 2021.  It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality.</p>  <p>  - In addition, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond. I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS. Subject to the Government meeting today, there may be further announcements in this regard.</p>  <p>  - The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan.</p>  <p>  - Finally, businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 as well as other liabilities. </p></reply>

However, in its recommendations, the Commission concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer of the child only. It is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they could achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them. A feature of the One-Parent Family Tax Credit was that it could be claimed by multiple individuals in respect of the same child, resulting in an unsustainable position.</p><p>The One-Parent Family Tax Credit was replaced with the Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit from 1 January 2014. The restructured credit is of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it also carries the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases that band to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to higher rate of income tax arises.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-01a.550.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060100068#WRK02600"><p>Deputy, I have been informed by my officials that the response set out below covers the numbers of protected disclosures as required under section 22 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. As detailed in the response, it is not possible to release some of the information requested.</p><p>In broad terms, a &lsquo;Protected Disclosure&rsquo; is a disclosure of information which the discloser believes may reveal wrongdoing and which came to the attention of the discloser through their employment. This is a very broad category of information. As such, it can be expected that in many cases disclosures falling into this category are received and dealt with in an appropriate proper manner without the person making the disclosure or those receiving it ever adverting to the fact that the information could be regarded as constituting a Protected Disclosure.</p><p>The legal obligations which arise in respect of Protected Disclosures consist principally of not penalising the discloser for making the disclosure and protecting the identity of the person making the disclosure in some circumstances.  These obligations would be routinely met without the need for any legal obligation to compel this to occur, so that it is generally not relevant whether the information constitutes a Protected Disclosure within the meaning of the legislation or not. It is, therefore, not possible to be certain that no disclosures which fall within the definition of Protected Disclosure but which have not been formally identified as a Protected Disclosure per se have been received. </p><p>It is for these reasons that it is not possible to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive response to the Deputy's question.  Having said that, it is important to state that the Department of Finance has put in place policy and procedures for the making of Protected Disclosures in the Department, which have been developed in line with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and agreed by the Department&rsquo;s Executive Board. This sets out the process by which a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; of the Department can make a Protected Disclosure, what will happen when a disclosure is made, and what the Department will do to protect the discloser.</p><p>The process supports the Department&rsquo;s strong commitment to ensuring that the culture and working environment of the Department encourage, facilitate and support any member of staff of the Department in &lsquo;speaking-up&rsquo; on any issue that may impact adversely on the Department&rsquo;s ability to properly and fully carry out all its roles and responsibilities to the highest performance standard required. Two alternative confidential recipients have been nominated to receive Protected Disclosures from internal staff, in the event that a staff member does not wish to make the disclosure to their Line Manager or the normal Senior Management Team. These nominees are the Department&rsquo;s Head of Legal and the Compliance Officer. To date, neither of these officers have received such an internal Protected Disclosure.</p><p>Section 22 of the Protected Disclosures Act requires the publication of a report in respect of Protected Disclosures received in the preceding year setting out certain information in respect of any Protected Disclosures received. For the purposes of complying with section 22, the Department publishes information regarding Protected Disclosures formally identified as such, without identifying the person making the disclosure.  Previous reports indicate that one Protected Disclosure was received in 2017 with a further one in 2018 and another one in 2019.  No Protected Disclosure was received during 2020 and this fact will be reflected in the required report for 2020 that is due to be published by this coming June.  To date, there has been no Protected Disclosure in 2021.</p><p>Tabular summary: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>No of Protected Disclosures</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>Nil </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>nil </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>nil to date</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Addressing this issue is a priority for this Government, as is reflected in the prioritisation of insurance reform. The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Insurance Reform sets out 66 actions which aim to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for consumers, business and other groups, including by increasing competition.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Fleming and I have held several meetings with representatives of the insurance industry and have raised the issue of professional indemnity cover, including for construction-related sectors. </p>  <p>  In his capacity as the Chair of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which was established within my Department as part of this comprehensive insurance reform agenda, Minister of State Fleming has also engaged with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. The Office is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance, including specialised cover in areas such as Professional Indemnity insurance. </p>  <p>  While the various structural factors that have contributed to the hardening of the Professional Indemnity insurance market are primarily international in origin, implementation of the Action Plan should nonetheless assist in attracting such insurers into the Irish insurance market when it begins to soften again, including in the construction sector. My officials will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

However, it is important to note that neither the Government nor the Central Bank of Ireland have any influence over the pricing or provision of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to any individual business or groups, as this is a commercial matter.  This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these constraints, insurance reform is a policy priority as illustrated by the Programme for Government. This contains commitments aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns around the cost and availability of insurance cover.  The Action Plan for Insurance Reform contains a range of deliverable actions across a number of policy areas. Actions delivered in the first three months of the year include:</p>  <p>  - The publication of new Personal Injuries Guidelines which will be formally adopted via legislation shortly;</p>  <p>  - Establishment of a new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market;</p>  <p>  - The commencement of a public consultation on enhancing role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB); and,</p>  <p>  - Introduction of new regulations on solicitors advertising.</p>  <p>  I would also like to add that we have iniated reform to PIAB, led by the Minister of State, Deputy Troy. We will make changes to duty of care legislation and we are also undertaking reforms to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to improve its powers in regard to competition. </p>  <p>  With respect to my own Department, it is the lead for just over a third of the actions in the Action Plan on Insurance Reform. Work is progressing to implement these actions within the timeframe set out in the Plan.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

The reports highlight Project Ireland 2040 achievements during 2018 and 2019 and give a detailed overview of the public investments which have been made throughout the country including in the following regional areas: the North-East, North-West, West, Mid-West, South-East, South-West, Dublin, Mid-East and Midlands. These nine Regional Reports, including that for the South-East, set out the projects and programmes which are being planned and delivered in each region as part of the public investment detailed in Project Ireland 2040. While the Regional Reports for the South-East do not provide an exhaustive list of all public capital expenditure in the region, they serve to highlight the diverse range of investments being made by the State under Project Ireland 2040 in the counties of Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford. </p>  <p>  More granular information on individual projects and programmes can be found on the capital investment tracker published by my Department and mostly recently updated in December 2020. This  update provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments that make up Project Ireland 2040. It focuses on projects with estimated costs greater than &euro;20 million. The update increased the coverage of projects and improved the functionality, including the ability to search the tracker by county, user-friendly dashboards and other information to aid interpretation of the data. The myProjectIreland interactive map was also updated in December 2020 and was extended to include almost 800 projects across the country. By clicking on the map on gov.ie/2040, citizens will find updated information on what has been achieved and what is planned for their own local area. This version features a dashboard with charts, allowing citizens to see the progress being made on projects at a glance. New search facilities also allow citizens to view projects in their regional area, by city, by county or by eircode. The Project Ireland 2040 Annual Reports, Regional Reports, capital investment tracker and myProjectIreland interactive map are all available on gov.ie/2040. Further updates to these publications are planned for later this year.</p></reply>

The goal of this regulatory framework will be to tackle the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through systemic oversight over how certain online services deliver and moderate the user-generated content on their platforms.</p>  <p>  These defined categories of harmful online content include content by which a person commits a criminal offences and a number of categories of potentially harmful content, these being:</p>  <p>  - Content by which a person engages in serious cyberbullying;</p>  <p>  - Content by which a person promotes suicide or self-harm, and,</p>  <p>  - Content by which a person promotes behaviour associated with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  These categories concerning potentially harmful content are carefully defined in the General Scheme to ensure that they deal with the most egregious content and respect other fundamental rights such as freedom of expression.  These definitions are being refined during detailed legal drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  While my Department has not been contacted in respect of the specific issue raised by the Deputy, provision is also made in the Bill for the addition of further categories of harmful online content in the future.  This process will involve a proposal by the Media Commission, informed by stakeholder consultation, and both Government and Oireachtas approval.  The Media Commission will be tasked with keeping a close eye on emerging online harms which may be suitable to be dealt with under the regulatory framework for online safety.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this provision is to future-proof the legislation to create a statutory process by which emerging online harms such as the issue raised by the Deputy may be examined for potential inclusion as a further category of harmful online content. This will help to avoid the need for ad-hoc primary legislation to deal with emerging harms in the future.</p>  <p>  It's intended that the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will be enacted this year.  The Bill is on the Government priority list for publication during the current legislative session, which ends in July 2021. </p>  <p>  At the same time, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht is conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the Bill.

All applications under the LSSIF were assessed in accordance with the published scoring criteria with scores were awarded based on factors such as the priority given to the project by the relevant NGB and/or local authority, the level of funding being provided by the project sponsor and the likelihood of increasing sports participation.</p><p>All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision if it was felt that an error was made in the assessment process. No appeal was received in respect of the project referred to by the Deputy. </p><p>It should be noted that a review of progress on the existing LSSIF grants is now underway. As part of this work the Department will be examining, inter alia, progress on all projects awarded funding to date. The scope for awarding new grants to projects which missed out under the first set of allocations will also be considered. This review is expected to be complete in the coming months.</p></reply>

Once the Government has taken its decision, the Minister for Health prepares regulations under the Section 31A of the Health Act 1947 .  </p>  <p>  As has been the case at each stage of the easing of restrictions, the set of measures introduced is intended to incrementally re-open the country while minimising the risks of transmission in alignment with risk levels. The Government is conscious of the impact of any and all restrictions across every sector and fully aware of the challenges individuals and businesses continue to face. The intention is to make steady progress with the reopening of society and the economy while avoiding a further wave of disease and re-imposition of restrictions.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that Government was in a position to revisit the position in relation to cinemas, drive-in cinemas and theatres when it met on Friday 28 May and I look forward to the re-opening of these important cultural facilities from 7 June.  </p></reply>

Both strands are valued artistically, with classical circus having a long working history in Ireland, while contemporary circus practice is relatively new. The Arts Act 2003 cites circus as one of nine art forms. As an art form, circus attracts high audience numbers each year including many rural audiences and members of new communities.</p><p>The live events sector has been impacted by Covid-19. There were some drive-in traditional circuses last year, which shows once again the innovation of the arts sector. Government support for circus as an art form is channelled through the Arts Council.  Primary support for the arts, including circus, is delivered through the Arts Council which is a statutory agency under the Arts Act 2003. Funding for the Arts Council has increased steadily in recent years, reaching a record level of &euro;130 million this year. Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions.</p><p>The tables below show the Arts Council support for circus and for traditional circus.</p><p>Table 1:<b>Arts Council total allocation to Circus,Street Arts and Spectacle 2019 &ndash;2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Description </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Strategic Funding</td>       <td>&euro;748,651 </td>       <td>&euro;748,650 </td>       <td>&euro;1,107,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arts Grants Funding</td>       <td>&euro;176,000 </td>       <td>&euro;236,000 </td>       <td>&euro;359,500 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Projects </td>       <td>&euro;154,100 </td>       <td>&euro;175,889 </td>       <td>&euro;330,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bursaries </td>       <td>&euro;45,500 </td>       <td>&euro;337,313 </td>       <td>&euro;431,080 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Commissions </td>       <td>&euro;0 </td>       <td>&euro;64,000 </td>       <td>&euro;0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals </td>       <td>&euro;1,124,251 </td>       <td>&euro;1,561,852 </td>       <td>&euro;2,227,580 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Change </td>       <td></td>       <td>39% </td>       <td>43% </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Table 2:<b>Arts Council allocation to TraditionalCircus 2020</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>&euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Duffy&rsquo;s Circus Awarded:    2020 - Arts Grant Funding - Circus</td>       <td>&euro;59,000.00 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Circus Gerbola Awarded: 2020 - Capacity Building Support   Scheme - Circus</td>       <td>&euro;17,400.00 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The strategic context for the Council's support of circus and all other art forms is set out in its strategy Making Great Art Work: Arts Council Strategy 2016-2025.  The Arts Council supports both strands of circus and, through direct support and strategic intervention, engages with the sector to assist individuals and organisations to develop high-quality performance and participatory work. Circus is supported by the Arts Council by way of grants under a range of categories including bursary, strategic funding, project awards and touring and dissemination awards.  There were very significant increases in supports provided for the circus in 2020 and 2021, with over &euro;2.2 million allocated to circus, street arts and spectacle in 2021. The council makes awards to circus organisations and to individual circus artists. In 2020, many circus artists also qualified for the council&rsquo;s Covid-19 crisis response award.  Details of all grants are available on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website.</p><p>While there are enterprise supports available for businesses and individuals impacted by Covid-19, these are matters for my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, in his role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the criteria for their eligibility. The Government has worked to support businesses through this difficult time with a comprehensive range of measures for firms of all sizes. The measures include the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities, the waiver of commercial rates the Sustaining Enterprise Fund and a reduced VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the hospitality and tourism sector to help businesses in the entertainment, tourism and hospitality sectors. </p></reply>

In order to maintain momentum on the sustainable tourism agenda, I reconvened the Sustainable Tourism Working Group early this year to complete the development of a suite of actions that promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to a new policy being developed. The overall focus for these actions is to promote sustainable tourism practices in all locations throughout the country rather than in any specific region.</p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government commitment, the development of a new national tourism policy, that mainstreams sustainability, will commence in the latter half of 2021 when the tourism sector starts to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry and our communities to help set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector.</p>  <p>  Central to developing a more resilient and sustainable tourism sector will be an increased focus on regional growth and season extension to deliver greater visitor dispersal throughout the country with a more even spread of demand across the year. I am very aware of the important role that Tourism plays as a driver of rural economies and I am committed to a continued focus on the potential of tourism to facilitate the development of our islands.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Deputy's specific question about the role F&aacute;ilte Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta play in developing and marketing sustainable island tourism, these are operational matters for the agencies.  I have requested the information from the agencies and I will forward it on the Deputy in accordance with timelines set out Standing Orders.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-01a.664.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060100069#WRL06075"><p>The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will, among other things, establish a regulatory framework for online safety to be overseen by an Online Safety Commissioner as part of a wider Media Commission. The General Scheme of the Bill provides for the establishment of a multi-person Media Commission with up to 6 commissioners. It is intended that an Executive Chairperson and 3 commissioners, including an Online Safety Commissioner, will be appointed initially following a recruitment campaign by the Public Appointments Service.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme provides that the Commission will delegate the performance of certain functional areas to individual commissioners and it's intended that the person recruited as the Online Safety Commissioner will be delegated the online safety related functions of the Commission. This approach was taken on foot of legal advice that specifying the exact role of each commissioner in the Bill would make it difficult to appoint additional commissioners to work on online safety in the future.</p>  <p>  The goal of the regulatory framework for online safety will be to tackle the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through systemic oversight over how regulated online services deliver and moderate the user-generated content on their platforms. This is a risk based approach that is intended to drive towards the best possible outcomes for all users of online services.</p>  <p>  While there is an appreciation of the desire for an individual complaints mechanism, there are serious doubts about the effectiveness of a statutory mechanism of this kind in the online safety space. There are a number of reasons for this, including that:</p>  <p>- requirements for fair procedures would not facilitate a swift resolution of individual issues, as it would be necessary to engage with the uploader of content as well as the complainant;</p>  <p>- the volume of online content, particularly as Ireland will be regulating Video Sharing Platform Services for the whole of the EU population of 450 million people, would overwhelm even the best resourced regulator</p>  <p>- referring complaints relating to individual items of content that are potentially criminal in nature to a civil regulator instead of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not be appropriate.</p>  <p>  Among other things however, the Bill provides the Commission with the power to oblige designated online services to have effective complaints and appeals mechanisms in place and also the power to audit those mechanisms. This is part of the risk-based framework that will enable the Commission to seek the greatest degree of protection for all users through systemic oversight.</p>  <p>  Individuals will always be able to bring issues to the attention of the Commission and the Commission will also have the power to order the removal of individual items of content in certain discrete instances. However, this will not be a formal complaints mechanism. </p>  <p>  The Commission will also be empowered to set up a systemic complaints scheme to receive complaints from nominated bodies such as expert NGOs about trends in the prevalence of harmful online content and the effectiveness of measures taken by regulated online services to comply with their obligations. This will help to inform the Commission about what the prominent and emerging risks are at any point in time and inform the Commission's approach to making online safety codes and conducting audits and investigations.</p></reply>

Public procurement below the relevant EU threshold is subject to National procurement rules that are set out in National Guidelines (Public Procurement Guidelines &ndash; Competitive Process published by the Department of Finance in 2004) and subsequent Circulars, the most recent being Circular 10/14 issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in April 2014. Circular 10/14 replaced the Department of Finance Circular 10/10 issued in August 2010.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Local Government Strategic Procurement Centre (LGSPC), which acts as a conduit between the Department, the Local Government Sector and the OGP, and is represented on the LGSPC Programme Board. The LGSPC provides additional supports to local authorities to ensure compliance by the sector in the use of all national frameworks and application of all relevant legislation and circulars relating to procurement.  The LGSPC also supports training for SMEs and small/micro business suppliers to improve their engagement with the public procurement process.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, procurement and tendering processes carried out by each local authority, and compliance with procurement rules in relation to the same, are directly a matter for the relevant Chief Executive.</p></reply>

The Programme Board has adopted a work programme for 2021 a number of which relate to the design, management and maintenance of Traveller-specific accommodation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the No End in Sight report just published by the Ombudsmans for Children's Office, my Department are in ongoing communication with the relevant local authority to provide the necessary supports so as to ensure that the recommendations made are implemented in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Over the course of the past year, and despite the on-going pandemic, my Department has progressed the rollout of a number of iniatives to improve the standard of accommodation on Traveller-specific sites.  These include:</p>  <p>  - A revised, preferential and affordable Caravan Loan Scheme for Traveller families which is being introduced on a 6 month pilot basis across four local authorities from May 2021 with the objective of rolling it out nationally if the pilot proves successful. This scheme, which has the support of Traveller representatives on the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, has the potential to make an immediate and hugely significant improvement to living conditions on sites.</p>  <p>  - The management and maintenance allowance payable per annum to local authorities by my Department for each halting site bay has just been increased by 50%. This will have an immediate and noticeable positive impact on halting site conditions.</p>  <p>  - In 2020, just over 250 halting sites were audited for Covid preparedness and a list of deficiencies and checklist of works was prepared for each site. This resulted in an investment of over &euro;4m in improvements to site conditions last year. </p>  <p>  Funding remains available from my Department to local authorities to carry out improvements works on existing sites and for new traveller specific accommdation proposals put forward by local authorities and this will continue.   </p></reply>

This is evident in the high number of HAP tenancies that continued to be set-up this year. The 2021 HAP target is for 15,000 additional tenancies and, at the end of Q1 2021, 3,914 HAP tenancies (26% of target) had been established.</p>  <p>  Measures that were required to be taken in the context of Covid-19, however, have had an impact on processing times for HAP applications, including Homeless HAP Applications. The average processing time at end Q4, 2020 was 38 days.  An analysis of more recent data from the HAP SSC indicates a reduction on that average processing time at end Q1, 2021 to 35 days.</p>  <p>  My Department and local authorities are keenly aware of the importance of minimising HAP processing times and the critical need to keep this under review at a local level. My Department has communicated this to local authority management through the County and City Management Association. </p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that any delay in tenants and landlords supplying relevant information, or inaccuracies or missing information, will impact on the processing time of the HAP application. However, in instances where there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority. The landlord is, therefore, not penalised for any delay.</p>  <p>  Through our ongoing engagement with local authorities my Department has stressed the need to minimise delays in processing these vital applications to ensure the social housing needs of tenants can be met through the HAP scheme where required. My Department is closely monitoring this situation and will continue to do so over the coming months. </p>  <p>  Additionally, as you are aware, under HAP, households at risk of homelessness may be eligible for additional supports.  To qualify for specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.  </p>  <p>  The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service, is a matter for each local authority.</p></reply>

At end Q1 2021, there were over 61,300 households in receipt of HAP and nearly 34,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.</p>  <p>  In respect of the provision of HAP funding, Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Accordingly, my Department does not recoup individual local authorities in respect of HAP rental payments in their administrative areas but, rather, recoups all landlord costs via the HAP SSC.</p>  <p>  Data in relation to the funding for HAP provided by the State in 2020, broken down by local authority area, can be found on my Department's website at this link: </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/#housing-assistance-payment</p>  <p>  This funding represents the portion paid by my Department after receipt of the differential rent which is paid by the tenant to the local authority. It does not include administration costs related to the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The overall cost of supporting the HAP Scheme to the Exchequer for 2020 was &euro;464.6 representing 59,821 active tenancies. </p>  <p>  The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) has been an important contributor to social housing supply since its introduction on a pilot basis in 2005 and has placed responsibility on local authorities to meet the accommodation needs of people in receipt of Rent Supplement for 18 months or longer, and who are assessed as having a long-term housing need. </p>  <p>  The scheme is delivered by local authorities who source accommodation from the private market and Approved Housing Bodies. Expenditure under the scheme covers recoupment made to local authorities for contracted rents due to private landlords and Approved Housing Bodies, administration costs and a damages contingency fund for newly acquired accommodation. </p>  <p>  Details for the number and cost to the exchequer of tenancies funded under the RAS scheme in County Tipperary in 2020, is available on my Department's website, titled &lsquo;RAS Current Expenditure Housing Programmes 2011 to 2020&rsquo;, at the following link: gov.ie - Overall social housing provision (www.gov.ie)  </p>  <p>  Funding for leasing projects is provided for under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). This Programme supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners and Approved Housing Bodies. </p>  <p>  At end 2020, a total of 374 leased properties were supported under SHCEP across all leasing delivery programmes in Tipperary County Council. The total Leasing spend under SHCEP in 2020 was &euro;2,547,845, of which &euro;1,002,904 was spent on long-term leases secured by both Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies. </p>  <p>  All data is based on local authority claims for operational agreements recorded on the Department's SHCEP financial management system. Any variations in data between operational figures and total output under leasing delivery streams may be due to the time lag in the submission of claims to my Department in respect of new claims after delivery.  </p>  <p>  The Leasing, RAS and HAP schemes continue to be effective and secure forms of social housing support and remain a significant part of the suite of social housing options currently available across the country.</p></reply>

There are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 218 fire stations nationwide.</p><p>Over the course of 2014/ 2015, an External Validation Group (EVG), commissioned by the Management Board of the NDFEM, visited every fire service in the country as part of a new external validation process arising from implementation of the 2013 &quot;Keeping Communities Safe&quot; national policy document. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;.  The Report, which sets out details of the process as well as findings is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>This first EVG report was welcomed as a benchmark of local authority provision of fire services in Ireland, and reviewed a number of themes. For the first time, it reported on the matching of provision of fire services with assessed fire risk. It reviewed fire safety work and undertook an assessment of the impact of national guidance on safety, health and welfare of staff in fire services. The Report concluded that the public are served well by the locally authority provided fire service arrangements and can retain confidence in the integrity and professionalism of those with responsibility for managing and delivering fire safety and fire services in Ireland. </p><p>In May 2019, the Management Board of NDFEM considered a proposal for a second round of external validation, or EVG II. Stakeholder engagement was undertaken in preparation for a thematic review process, which was scheduled to commence in Q1 2020. However, due to Covid-19, the Board made a decision to postpone this process. </p><p>As an alternative, in May 2020, the Board mandated staff in the NDFEM to undertake a review of the impact of Covid-19 on local authority fire service resilience and response, as well as on fire safety work and to look at fire services roles in supporting Covid-related emergency management. The objective was to capture  issues arising, lessons to be learned and good practice which worked during the first phase of Covid-19 response, so that essential services could continue to be maintained in case of further surges. </p><p>This review was undertaken by means of &lsquo;virtual visits&rsquo; (i.e. by Webex link) to each of the 27 fire services and three Regional Communications Centres. This &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; process was undertaken by an NDFEM team, working in association with Chief Fire Officers and their staff and local authority executives. These visits were undertaken between the 24th of June and the 22nd of September 2020.  A composite report on themes related to the impact of Covid-19 on fire services, titled 'Response and Resilience' was compiled and presented to the NDFEM Management Board in October 2020. While this is an internal report to facilitate sharing of good practice and has not been published, a copy can be made available if required. </p><p>The position in relation to undertaking another round of External Validation will be kept under review by the NDFEM Management Board, taking account of the experience of the virtual approch in 2020 and in light of the evolving Covid-19 situation. </p></reply>

The most popular option for reform was the insertion of a provision into the Constitution that "the State shall progressively realise economic, social and cultural rights, subject to maximum available resources and that this duty is cognisable by the Courts". In relation to which specific rights should be enumerated in the Constitution, these included rights to housing, social security, essential health care, rights of people with disabilities, linguistic and cultural rights and the rights covered in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. </p>  <p>  The commitments in relation to constitutional reform in the Programme for Government provide for the holding of a referendum on housing. The Programme for Government also commits to establishing a Commission on Housing to examine issues such as tenure, standards, sustainability, and quality-of-life issues in the provision of housing.  It is planned that the Commission on Housing will review the commitment to hold a referendum on housing, once it has been formally established in September this year, and the Terms of Reference and Membership of the Commission have been finalised.

The 6 existing National Parks of Ireland account for circa 65,000 hectares of this network with a further 22,000 hectares comprising  nature reserves and other heritage sites. </p>  <p>  Our National Parks are managed as Category II National Parks under the criteria set out by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). Under this Category, ownership and management should normally be by the highest competent authority of the State. Accordingly, all National Parks in Ireland are fully owned and managed by the State through the NPWS Division of my Department. It is the policy of my Department to abide by the criteria and standards for the National Parks laid down by the IUCN which can be found at www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about/protected-areas-categories/category-ii-national-park  </p>  <p>  The 6 existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually. Given the resources available for capital investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National Parks in the country. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, the NPWS is actively looking at Biosphere designation nationwide, and is currently working on an application for submission to UNESCO for the Lough Ree Area. The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to realise our outstanding target of 10% marine protected area (MPA) coverage in Ireland's waters as soon as is practicable, aiming for 30% by 2030. In this regard we have committed to deliver comprehensive legislation for the identification, designation and management of MPAs in Ireland. It is within the framework of such legislation that the Government will deliver the establishment of clearly defined marine protected areas, including processes for their identification, designation and management.  </p>  <p>  The NPWS is continually implementing "Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland", its tourism interpretative plan for our National Parks and National Reserves. This document sets out a road map for investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Project 2040. While my Department has no specific plans to expand the park network at present it is actively ensuring the preservation, protection and presentation of the assets it already owns.  Recent land acquisitions in this regard underpin the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy. These include the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park through purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 and a further 79.08 hectares at Carrigcurra in 2020 ; the 2018 expansion of Wild Nephin National Park to create a State &ndash; owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares; and in 2021, the acquisition of 21.96 hectares at Knockauns adjacent to the Burren National Park.  </p></reply>

These limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In reviewing the rent limits, my Department worked closely with DSP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases.</p>  <p>  Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.  The current maximum HAP rent limits are available on the Irish Statute Book website at the following link:</p>  <p>  http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/56/made/en/print?q=housing&amp;years=2017. </p>  <p>  Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.  </p>  <p>  In considering this issue, I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p>  <p>  My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally adequate to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme. However, I will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

In this regard, Class 31 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides that certain classes of development carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service are, subject to specified conditions, exempted development from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Where the conditions and size thresholds specified in the exemption class are not complied with or are exceeded, planning permission is required.</p>  <p>  Exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of specific forms of development are provided for when they are considered to be consistent with proper planning and sustainable development.</p>  <p>  While access roads are not listed under Class 31 of the Regulations, article 9(1)(ii) of the Regulations states that any development that would:</p>  <p>  "consist of or comprise the formation, laying out or material widening of a means of access to a public road the surfaced carriageway of which exceeds 4 metres in width"</p>  <p>  shall not be exempted development.  </p>  <p>  In addition, article 9(1)(iii) of the Regulations provides that where a development would endanger public safety of road users by reason of traffic hazard or obstruction, planning permission is required. </p>  <p>  The Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures Guidelines, issued under section 28 of the Act by my Department to Planning Authorities in 1996, state that:</p>  <p>  "access roads should be permitted only where they are absolutely necessary and great care should be taken that they will not appear as a scar on a hillside. It should normally be a condition of permission that such roads are grubbed up at the end of the construction period". </p>  <p>  Where a question arises on whether development is or is not development, or is or is not exempted development, any person may seek a declaration from the relevant planning authority under section 5 of the Act. A planning authority that is in receipt of a section 5 application is required to make its decision in respect of the application within four weeks of the date of receipt of the application.  A decision made by a planning authority in respect of such an application may be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. </p>  <p>  Under section 152 of the Act, it is obligatory for the planning authority to follow up substantive written complaints of breaches of the planning code, unless it considers the complaint to be trivial or vexatious, or without substance or foundation.</p>  <p>  Once a planning authority has received a written complaint and forms the view that unauthorised development may have been, is being or may be carried out, it must issue a warning letter to the owner or person carrying out the development unless the development in question is of a trivial or minor nature.</p></reply>

My Department has invited all local authorities to submit applications to it with respect to properties of natural and/or cultural heritage within their area of responsibility, which may meet the requirements for inclusion on the Tentative List. The deadline for applications is 30 June 2021.</p><p>My Department's policy is for applications to be promoted and sponsored by the relevant local authorities in order to ensure continuity throughout the process. Other organizations, community groups or individuals interested in submitting an application have been encouraged to apply in collaboration with the local authority and support has been provided when appropriate to do so. The role of the local authorities to lead engagement with community organisations on the ground is crucial in order to facilitate public consultation and wider stakeholder involvement, particularly in light of the requirement under the UNESCO Operational Guidelines for participatory planning and stakeholder consultation. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service has been liaising very closely with those local authorities that have expressed interest in having a site  within their county boundaries included on the revised Tentative List, providing advice and guidance on an ongoing basis and encouraging them to engage with relevant stakeholders at a local level.</p><p>My Department has engaged with all local authorities who expressed an interest in having a site within their county boundaries included on the revised Tentative List. This engagement has included facilitating two World Heritage Workshops in collaboration with ICOMOS Ireland, one held in Killarney in February 2020 and a follow-up workshop online in June 2020. These workshops focussed on next steps in the review process, World Heritage knowledge sharing, management of serial and transboundary applications, and the requirements of completing the Tentative List application form. At these workshops the challenges in the preparation of nomination documentation and management plans for prospective World Heritage properties was detailed and the need for wide public consultation and local stakeholder engagement was reinforced. </p><p>Following attendance at the workshops, interested parties were requested to submit draft Tentative List applications for review and feedback to ensure that the next Tentative List features properties that are well-placed to progress to World Heritage nomination. Throughout November and December 2020 my Department facilitated feedback in relation to the draft applications through individual online meetings with a World Heritage Expert. </p><p>My Department has also commissioned studies to further inform the review process for the Tentative List:</p><p>- Peer review of the 2014 Burren Technical Evaluation as a World Heritage Site, 2020;</p><p>- Glendalough OUV Study, expected June 2021;and</p><p>- Valentia Cable Station and Associated Sites, Heritage Study, 2020.</p><p>The basis for not anticipating an application for The Early Medieval Monastic Sites, other than Glendalough Monastic Site, is because despite the huge encouragement there was no engagement with my Department by all the relevant local authorities in respect of a revised application. </p><p>The anticipation for receiving applications in respect of The Burren, Glendalough Monastic Site, The Passage Tomb Landscapes of Sligo, The Royal Sites, and Valentia Transatlantic Cable Station is based on the level of engagement withthe process by and from  the relevant local authorities, working in conjunction with community organisations. Draft applications have been received for these properties and the local authorities are working with relevant stakeholders to demonstrate that there is sufficient support for the project in the community.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water's capital investment plan for drinking water and waste water infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and delivery of the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040. This overall funding commitment is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and waste water infrastructure.</p><p>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is the independent economic regulator of Irish Water.  In August 2020, the CRU published its determination on Irish Water&rsquo;s third revenue control (RC3) setting out the total level of allowed revenue that Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from customers, to cover its efficiently incurred costs during the period 2020 to 2024. Irish Water's annual exchequer funding for domestic water services is determined through the annual estimates and budgetary process, having regard to the CRU determination under the economic regulatory process.</p><p>It may be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email at Oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  </p><p>Local authorities report to my Department on numbers of overall inspections carried out and enforcement actions undertaken on a quarterly basis. The most recent data received in respect of the number of inspections of all private rental properties and those with HAP tenancies is set out in the table below:  <table>    <tr>       <th>HAP Inspections carried out in 2019</th>       <th>Total    Inspections carried out in 2019</th>       <th>HAP On-site Inspections carried out in    2020</th>       <th>Total On-site Inspections carried out in 2020</th>       <th>HAP Virtual Inspections    <br /><br />   carried out in 2020</th>       <th>Total Virtual Inspections carried out in 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>23,424</td>       <td>40,728</td>       <td>12,031</td>       <td>24,315</td>       <td>991</td>       <td>1,388</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The following is the HAP Inspections breakdown for Galway County Council: <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Inspections of HAP  Dwellings</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>661</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>719</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>808</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 to end of Q1</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Significant Exchequer funding has been made available to local authorities in recent years to aid increasing inspections.  Funding has increased four-fold from &euro;2.5m in 2018 to &euro;10m in 2021.  The increase in rental inspection figures in Galway reflects this increase in resources. Galway has been pro-active with regard to inspections and their 2020 figure would most likely be higher if not for Covid. </p><p>Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings &ndash; not just those with HAP tenancies. The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s Local Authority Resilience and Recovery Plan for living with Covid-19 (October 2020) and its subsequent Local Authority Services Framework for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response (January 2021) do not permit rental inspections in Levels 4 and 5. This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and rental inspectors.</p><p>In response to the difficulties caused by pandemic restrictions, some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. Dublin City Council have led this initiative which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and being asked to confirm that any remedial works requested by the local authority have been completed, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to so. </p><p>While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. I support these initiatives and my Department is encouraging local authorities not involved in the pilots to consider adopting them. I have committed to providing Exchequer funding for those that do. Galway County Council have expressed interest in the virtual inspection process.</p></reply>

My Department wrote again to planning authorities on 2 July and 26 September of that year seeking new or revised estimates following the designation of additional RPZs in certain parts of the country, which extended the application of the STL provisions to these areas. Details of the resource requirements sought primarily relate to the recruitment of additional enforcement staff, but also include, inter alia, associated legal, IT and other administrative costs.</p>  <p>  Since then, further communication has taken place between my Department and all relevant planning authorities seeking clarification and refinement of the resourcing requests, as well as in relation to the practical implementation of the STL provisions. </p>  <p>  For 2020, &euro;2.5m was made available by my Department to support planning authorities in the implementation and enforcement of the STL legislation. Similarly, a further &euro;2.5m has been made available in respect of 2021.</p>  <p>  In December 2019, Galway City Council, further to its resourcing funding request, received approval to incur expenditure on dedicated STL implementation and enforcement resources, and funding of up to &euro;241,500 in 2020 and &euro;262,500 in 2021 was made available from my Department to cover this expenditure. </p>  <p>  I understand that Galway City Council commenced a recruitment process for dedicated STL staff however, no suitable candidates were found to take up the contract on offer. The Covid-19 pandemic then put a hold on new recruitment. While staffing is a matter for individual local authorities, the Council has advised that the recruitment process for dedicated STL staff is currently being reviewed and my Department is awaiting an update on its progress in this regard. Currently, the planning enforcement section in the Council is responsible for the enforcement of the STL legislation. </p>  <p>  To date, Galway City Council has drawn down a small amount of the funding approved for the enforcement of STL, to cover legal costs. In this connection, the outstanding funding for 2021 remains available to the Council should it wish to submit any further claims, including in respect of any dedicated enforcement staff recruited. </p>  <p>  Regarding the five planning applications for change of use received, it should be noted that change of use planning is just one way to ensure compliance with the STL legislation. Properties can also be registered with the Council in accordance with the STL Regulations, can cease STL activity altogether and can be returned to the long-term rental market. In this connection, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the number of properties being made available for short-term letting purposes, with many - at least temporarily - now operating in the long-term letting sector.  </p></reply>

We agreed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Common Travel Area healthcare arrangements and brought into force an Ireland-UK Social Security Convention in late 2020. Work on finalising an MoU on education arrangements in the CTA is also at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  Importantly, both the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement explicitly take account of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK. This allows for the protection of established bilateral arrangements so that Irish and British citizens can continue to live, work and study - and access healthcare, social security and public services - in each jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  The Government has had to introduce a range of restrictions on domestic and international travel to address the unprecedented challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions were developed on the basis of public health advice and are being amended on the basis of such advice, as conditions allow. The restrictions remain consistent with the CTA, in that they apply equally to all passengers arriving into Ireland, including Irish citizens, with only very limited exceptions.</p>  <p>  The CTA of course allows for Irish and British citizens to move freely between Ireland and the UK. I want to see this travel taking place in as seamless a manner as possible, as soon as this is feasible and safe. The CTA plays a vital role in facilitating the way in which Irish and British people live on these islands, and it will continue to underpin our bilateral relationship.   </p></reply>

The coercive forced landing of a Ryanair flight over Belarus to detain a journalist and opposition activist featured prominently during those discussions. The Taoiseach communicated clearly Ireland&rsquo;s view that a strong EU response is needed.</p>  <p>  EU leaders called for the immediate release of Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega, and for an urgent investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Leaders also agreed on introducing new sanctions, including economic sanctions, calling on airlines to avoid Belarussian airspace and commencing work to ban Belarussian airlines from EU airspace. Work on operationalising these concrete steps has already commenced and Ireland is working closely with the EU and Member States to that end.</p>  <p>  Relations with Belarus were discussed at an informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 27 May and the next steps in implementing the steps agreed by European Leaders were considered with a clear consensus on the need make rapid progress. </p>  <p>  Ireland has rejected the false narrative of the Belarusian Government and Minister Ryan called for a transparent and independent investigation during a special International Transport Forum meeting on 27 May. ICAO has since confirmed that they will investigate the incident and Ireland fully supports this decision. Along with our EU and international partners we will remain focused on ensuring that those responsible for endangering the passengers and crew, and for the ongoing repression in Belarus, are brought to account for their actions.</p></reply>

It may be the case that the final legislation differs from what is proposed, or indeed that the draft legislation will not become law. As such, it is not appropriate for me to comment on the draft legislation or any impact it may have.</p>  <p>  I would also recall that rules and legislation regarding the transfer of data to countries outside the EU is a competence of the European Commission.

The default transfer mechanism is known as  an &lsquo;adequacy decision&rsquo;. This is an implementing decision by the Commission which guarantees that the third country in question provides an equivalent level of protection of personal data as exists in the EU. Once a third country has been assessed by the Commission as providing an equivalent level of protection, transfers of EU citizens&rsquo; data can take place between the EU and the selected third country under that adequacy decision, without limitation or additional safeguards. </p>  <p>  Following a recent court case, the European Commission and the US authorities are currently engaged in discussions regarding a new adequacy decision, focusing on enforceable rights and safeguards for EU citizens&rsquo; data.</p>  <p>  Officials in our Embassy in Washington DC continue to monitor developments regarding EU&ndash;US data transfers and proposed legislative changes concerning same. </p></reply>

At present, three Irish people are granted College of Europe scholarships annually by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. </p>  <p>  From 2022, the new Strategy will require additional funding amounting to &euro;1.5 million.

We monitor closely our compliance rate; in 2020, just 0.025% of the total number of passports and Foreign Birth Registration certificates that issued were subject to a suspected data breach. We continue to work towards lowering this figure further in 2021.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, the data breaches recorded by this Department have been deemed low or medium risk to the data subject. The main cause of data breaches is human error. Examples of such an error causing a data breach would include incorrectly addressed correspondence issued by post and email. The remainder of breaches are largely due to external unintentional acts.

In December last, 2020, I participated in the 23rd ASEAN-EU Foreign Ministers Meeting where the EU-ASEAN relationship was upgraded to the level of strategic partnership.</p>  <p>  This provides opportunities for increased cooperation in the areas of economy, security, sustainable connectivity and sustainable development including climate action. The Strategic partnership also provides renewed support for the negotiation of an EU-ASEAN Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement</p>  <p>  The EU  has also agreed a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore, which entered into effect on 21 November 2019. This agreement offers good opportunities to Irish and European companies businesses in the region to trade more easily and to lower the costs of doing business. </p>  <p>  Singapore, in particular, is a major trading partner for Ireland in Asia Pacific. Trade in goods and services with Ireland in 2019 was more than &euro;10bn. This highlights the importance of Singapore as a destination for Irish business.</p></reply>

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper on Defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. </p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms such as Defence Forces vehicle fleet. The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and for two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation.   Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of these enhanced capabilities.  No decisions have been made for the acquisition of additional aircraft in other roles such as dedicated troop carriers.</p>  <p>  While the option of acquiring a wider military lift capability has been mentioned, it is not identified as an action for acquisition in the present 5 year Equipment Development Plan, which was developed through a joint civil-military approach.   Much of this longer range lift capability for military purposes is provided by way of chartering aircraft through a competitive procurement process on an as-required basis.  To date, this has been considered to be the most cost effective approach taking account of the acquisition, running and maintenance costs of larger aircraft in the context of their expected usage and contingency requirements.  The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The military fleet, which consists of military specific vehicles such as armoured vehicles, trucks and off-road SUVs, comprises approximately 55% of the fleet. The administrative fleet are vehicles that can be purchased commercially such as saloon, stores vehicles and minibuses. They comprise approximately 45% of the Defence Forces fleet. </p><p>In line with Government policy in relation to the Clean Vehicle Directive, the Defence Forces are committed to procuring vehicles that have reduced carbon emissions. </p><p>Due to the specific nature and requirements of the military fleet of vehicles and the locations where they are likely to operate, these vehicles are Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) type and will be replaced, as required, with fossil fuel ICE vehicles for the reasons outlined above. The Defence Forces, however, endeavours to replace these ICE vehicles with more energy efficient models where possible. For example, the new SUV and Troop Carrying Vehicle (TCV) fleets will be replaced with EURO 6 compliant engines which will result in a 50% reduction in emissions compared to the older EURO 3 engines which they replace. </p><p>The Defence Forces has committed to replacing the administrative fleet with energy efficient (green vehicles) as the technology allows. To date the investment in energy efficient vehicles as outlined in Table 1 above amounts to &euro;1.2m inclusive of VAT. The Defence Forces has committed to spend a minimum of 6% of the DF vehicle replacement budget on EV starting in 2020 and a minimum of 8% in 2021, with a commitment to increase investment by a minimum of 2% of budget each subsequent year. Already in 2021 the Defence Forces have taken delivery of eight (8) EV saloons and an electric buggy. A further eight (8) EV stores vehicles have been ordered with delivery expected in Q2.</p><p>The Corps of Engineers have also invested in supporting infrastructure with the installation of 19 EV chargers across 16 Defence Forces locations to sustain the enlargement of the Defence Forces Electric Vehicle fleet into the future. </p><p>I am satisfied that, with these new acquisitions and the planning for future clean vehicle procurements, the Defence Forces will continue to have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

Their important contribution to the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces is appreciated.  </p><p>I understand that the Chief of Staff will make further recommendations for personnel to be re-enlisted in the coming period. </p></reply>

In this context, I would highlight the security role of the Naval Service, a role which by its nature can go unrecognised or unacknowledged. I am advised that the fleet is managed to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service has nine ships. Two ships are currently in operational reserve but can be called upon for surge operations in times of national emergency, as was the case when a ship was taken out of operational reserve and deployed to Cork City for COVID-19 support to the HSE for a number of weeks last year. In addition one ship is in the process of a mid-life re-fit which is expected to last 18 - 24 months. There are 6 operational ships that remain available at present. </p>  <p>The Deputy will appreciate that, for operational and security reasons, it would not be appropriate to disclose details of the operational deployment of any individual vessel in the Naval Service. I can assure the Deputy that notwithstanding current challenges being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations.    </p></reply>

The existing Special Class and Special School Programme has been expanded from 4 to 5 weeks.</p><p>While participation in the programmes is voluntary, enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage schools to offer the programme, including measures to reduce the administrative burden, provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes, earlier payment of school staff and provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer to work on the programme.</p><p>The programme&rsquo;s aims are to support students to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they can move on  to their planned educational placement next September along with their peers. </p><p>A home-based summer programme will continue to be available for students with complex needs where their schools are not providing a school-based programme.</p><p>The programmes were developed following extensive engagement with education and disability stakeholders.

In subjects or modules where it is not specifically mentioned the topic of breastfeeding may occur during class conversation and through interactions with students.</p>  <p>  For example, from a nutritional aspect the subject of breastfeeding may come up in Post Primary Home Economics when discussing healthy lifestyles and nutritional requirements across all ages. In the Leaving Certificate Applied Childcare/Community care module on the care of babies and young children, Unit 1 addresses breast and bottle feeding. </p>  <p>  From a social aspect, Junior Cycle Home Economics includes Strand Two on exploring the roles and responsibilities of the family while Leaving Certificate Home Economics includes Topic 3.1.6: Family As A Caring Unit. In Leaving Certificate Applied Social Education,the module on Social and Health Education, Unit 2: Relationships &ndash;  the topic may be covered while discussing parenting and the needs that children have at various stages of their development.</p>  <p>  Further relevant subjects would be within the SPHE curriculum. Junior Cycle SPHE Strand Two: Minding Myself and Others contains learning outcomes 2.3: describe what promotes a sense of belonging in school, at home and in the wider community and their own role in creating an inclusive environment and 2.4: distinguish between appropriate care giving and receiving. At Leaving Certificate level, SPHE aims to develop health literacy, both for the individual student and for groups. Health literacy is the capacity of individuals to obtain discerningly, interpret and understand health information; this includes the confidence to access health services and the competence to use such information and services in ways that enhance health. Once students&rsquo; health literacy skills are developed, they will be able to seek out relevant knowledge and information using a variety of sources including digital sources.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department of Health has produced a Breastfeeding Information Pack for Junior Cycle students in Irish Secondary Schools.</p>  <p>  The Information Pack was commissioned jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE Population Health Directorate, and developed by researchers from Health Promotion, Training &amp;amp; Support Services and Elm Training under the direction of a multidisciplinary, multisectoral expert advisory committee with representation from the relevant statutory and voluntary health services, SPHE coordinators and teachers from the relevant education sectors. The views and opinions of Junior Cycle students from a diversity of urban and rural schools were also pivotal in the development of the Information Pack.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the initiative is contained in Action 42 of &lsquo;Breastfeeding in Ireland: A Five Year Strategic Action Plan&rsquo; (Department of Health and Children, Oct. 2005), which recommended introducing breastfeeding information and promotion to schoolchildren at all levels of education within the context of the SPHE curriculum.</p>  <p>  In general, my Department does not have a role in approving, commissioning, sponsoring or endorsing any content in any educational textbook. The current policy within my Department is not to endorse any particular product or publication, including textbooks. There are a small number of exceptions where my Department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a need &ndash; for example with Leaving certificate Japanese and Italian. However, as with all textbooks there is no obligation for a school to use these in their delivery of the curriculum. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level. </p>  <p>  The majority of textbooks are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers. The Irish Educational Publishers Association (IEPA) meets with the NCCA in order to discuss the curriculum and to be made aware of any requirements in the curriculum. However the content of any individual textbook is determined by the publisher themselves, and therefore any queries regarding specific content in any particular textbook should be directed to the publisher.</p>  <p>  The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms</p></reply>

The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics.  The second half of the NDP (from 2023 onwards) will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.</p>  <p>  Under the Ireland Project 2040, we will invest &euro;8.4 billion (compared to &euro;4.9 billion in the previous decade) in primary and post primary school buildings. </p>  <p>  The immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p></reply>

In accordance with these rules, each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. It is a matter for the school to employ teachers up to the limit of its approved allocation and at its discretion to deploy those teachers to the subject areas that the school chooses to provide.</p>  <p>  A school authority may, from time to time, encounter unanticipated difficulty which it has not been in a position to immediately resolve, through its school planning and management processes in meeting essential curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation. In such circumstances, my Department will consider requests by a school authority for a staffing concession as short-term support i.e. curricular concessions.</p>  <p>  If a School Authority is not satisfied with the decision of the Department in regard to its application for a curricular concession, it may appeal to the Post Primary Independent Appeals Board. The Post Primary Appeals Board, which operates independently of the Department, considers appeals by school authorities against decisions of the Department in regard to teaching staff allocations to all Second Level Schools. The Board will only consider appeals made by the relevant school management authority and its decisions are final. </p></reply>

Each school should use their COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with the public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps school must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).</p></reply>

Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.</p><p>DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019, stated that the allocations being made for 2019 would initially remain in place for a minimum of two years, following which, revised profiled allocations would be considered for schools from September 2021. </p><p>The NCSE Policy advice &lsquo;A Proposed new Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014)&rsquo; on which the SET allocation model is based, recommended that &lsquo;the additional teaching supports be left in place initially for a two-year period. As the new model becomes embedded in the system, this may be extended to three years.&rsquo;</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.</p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. </p><p>Maintaining the existing allocations of Special Education Teachers for the 2021/22 school year means that schools will not have to engage in an extensive redeployment of posts, or re-clustering, this year.</p><p>It also means that schools will have greater levels of certainty as to the staff that they will have in place for September.</p><p>No school will see a cut, or reduction, to their special education teaching support next year.</p><p>Where schools have growing enrolments year on year, they will receive an increased allocation, pending the next re-profiling. </p><p>Even in circumstances where some schools were anticipating a greater level of increase year on year, if full re profiling had occurred next year, the increased allocations for developing status combined with the existing allocation of the school will show an increased overall teacher allocation for these schools in 2021/22.</p><p>The allocations for 2021/22 which are being maintained comprise the allocations which were made for schools from September 2019 plus any additionality achieved since plus any developing hours for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school years.</p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>I understand that this school has advised that they intend to submit an application for a review of their special education teacher allocations to the NCSE, and this application will then be considered by that body.</p><p>Based on the enrolments projected by the school for September 2021, the school is also due to receive some additional allocation of Special Education Teaching hours for Spetember, based on the fact that the school will have increased enrolments.</p></reply>

Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.</p><p>DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019, stated that the allocations being made for 2019 would initially remain in place for a minimum of two years, following which, revised profiled allocations would be considered for schools from September 2021. </p><p>The NCSE Policy advice &lsquo;A Proposed new Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014)&rsquo; on which the SET allocation model is based, recommended that &lsquo;the additional teaching supports be left in place initially for a two-year period. As the new model becomes embedded in the system, this may be extended to three years.&rsquo;</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.</p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. </p><p>Maintaining the existing allocations of Special Education Teachers for the 2021/22 school year means that schools will not have to engage in an extensive redeployment of posts, or re-clustering, this year.</p><p>It also means that schools will have greater levels of certainty as to the staff that they will have in place for September.</p><p>No school will see a cut, or reduction, to their special education teaching support next year.</p><p>Where schools have growing enrolments year on year, they will receive an increased allocation, pending the next re-profiling. </p><p>Even in circumstances where some schools were anticipating a greater level of increase year on year, if full re profiling had occurred next year, the increased allocations for developing status combined with the existing allocation of the school will show an increased overall teacher allocation for these schools in 2021/22.</p><p>The allocations for 2021/22 which are being maintained comprise the allocations which were made for schools from September 2019 plus any additionality achieved since plus any developing hours for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school years.</p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>As this school is aware, a process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>As the NCSE is an independent body which has a statutory function to access and review the resources required to provide for special education, where a school has concerns about the outcome of a review conducted by the NCSE, the school should raise that matter directly with the NCSE.</p></reply>

It is considered proper financial management of public voted allocations to retain a certain minimum level of contingency for surplus to surrender each year.</p><p>For the information of the Deputy the surplus surrendered by the Department of Education and Skills in each of the years 2017 to 2019 is as follows:</p><p>2017:&euro;24.54 Million which equates to 0.3% of the voted budget for that year.</p><p>2018:&euro;114.464 Million which equates to 1.2% of the voted budget for that year. The main reason for this surplus surrender was due to EU receipts of &euro;109 million being received late in December 2018 that were expected to be received in January 2019. </p><p>2019:&euro;6.263 Million which equates to 0.06% of the voted budget for that year.</p><p>The surplus for surrender for 2020 will be finalised at the conclusion of the audit of the Appropriation Account for the Department of Education.  However, the provisional figure for 2020 is &euro;138 Million, which equates to 1.6% of the voted budget for the year.  This surrender arose due to the reduced costs of certain services within the schools sector due to public health restrictions in place in 2020 and some surplus on the ring-fenced Covid financial supports for schools.</p><p>While the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Education Needs Officers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for assistive technology support, the relevant funding comes from the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The amounts expended in relation to the provision of assistive technology support and the variation against the amount allocated for each of the years 2017 to 2020 (figures for that year being provisional) is set out in the attached table. Any amounts remaining unspent at year end form part of the surplus surrendered to the Exchequer. </p><p>The assistive technology scheme is demand led. The Covid pandemic impacted on the amount expended on the scheme in 2020 with the number of grants paid having reduced compared to previous years.</p><p>Table:  <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="5"><div>Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistive Technology</td>       <td>Expenditure</td>       <td>Allocation</td>       <td>Variation &euro;</td>       <td>Variation %</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>2,444,727</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>See Note 1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2,382,785</td>       <td>2,956,583</td>       <td>-573,798 </td>       <td>-19%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2,577,180</td>       <td>3,493,593</td>       <td>-916,413 </td>       <td>-26%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 (Prov.)</td>       <td>2,013,236</td>       <td>3,498,527</td>       <td>-1,485,291 </td>       <td>-42%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Note 1:  In 2017, the assistive technology for pupils with special education needs allocation for the primary sector was included within an overall allocation for special educations initiatives.

This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in budget 2019.</p><p>The combined increases given in 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration will be achieved. </p><p>All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date.

Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.</p><p>DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019, stated that the allocations being made for 2019 would initially remain in place for a minimum of two years, following which, revised profiled allocations would be considered for schools from September 2021. </p><p>The NCSE Policy advice &lsquo;A Proposed new Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014)&rsquo; on which the SET allocation model is based, recommended that &lsquo;the additional teaching supports be left in place initially for a two-year period. As the new model becomes embedded in the system, this may be extended to three years.&rsquo;</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations will continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.</p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. </p><p>Maintaining the existing allocations of Special Education Teachers for the 2021/22 school year means that schools will not have to engage in an extensive redeployment of posts, or re-clustering, this year.</p><p>It also means that schools will have greater levels of certainty as to the staff that they will have in place for September.</p><p>No school will see a cut, or reduction, to their special education teaching support next year.</p><p>Where schools have growing enrolments year on year, they will receive an increased allocation, pending the next re-profiling. </p><p>Even in circumstances where some schools were anticipating a greater level of increase year on year, if full re profiling had occurred next year, the increased allocations for developing status combined with the existing allocation of the school will show an increased overall teacher allocation for these schools in 2021/22.</p><p>The allocations for 2021/22 which are being maintained comprise the allocations which were made for schools from September 2019 plus any additionality achieved since plus any developing hours for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school years.</p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: <i>ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Primary-Schools-Review-Application-2020.doc.</i></p></reply>

In this context, a number of potential uses were explored and it was ultimately decided that this site, which is located in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire School Planning Area, will best accommodate the new post primary school announced to serve the two school planning areas of Booterstown/Blackrock and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p>  <p>  Design work is ongoing in relation to the proposed development of the post primary school on this site. </p></reply>

In order to minimise incidents regarding these types of data breaches, there are regular reminders for staff to be vigilant in matters of data protection. </p><p>For example, recent Data Protection Awareness Weeks placed particular emphasis on how staff need to remain aware in relation to accidental data breaches.  Also, posters were issued to offices throughout the Department with the particular message to be vigilant when sending letters or e-mails, i.e., to double-check address details and letter contents and not to send personal data in bulk e-mails. </p><p>It is mandatory for all staff in the Department, and for new entrants, to complete the GDPR e-learning module and to obtain a pass rate of at least 80% at the exam that concludes the module.  All new staff (including temporary clerical officers) must complete the module before they are granted access to any system containing customer data. </p><p>In addition, Data Protection Unit staff visit the Department's Offices and deliver presentations on data protection and answer staff questions throughout the year.  Given the current travel restrictions, video presentations are being developed for staff to view online.</p></reply>

If the parents are experiencing a difficulty in finding a place in an early learning and care or school-age childcare setting they can contact their local City /County Childcare Committee (contact details at myccc.ie/) who will try to assist them in finding a suitable place.</p>  <p>  If the parents are seeking a place for their child in primary school or in early intervention class in a school setting, supports are available through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), affiliated to the Department of Education. If so, I would recommend the parents to contact their local Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) for further assistance. The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  Many children with disabilities, including autism, take part in mainstream early learning and care services. Participation of children with disabilities in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) universal pre-school programme in mainstream preschool settings is supported by the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM). The key objective of AIM is to support early learning and care providers to deliver an inclusive preschool experience, ensuring that children with a disability can fully participate in the ECCE Programme, thereby reaping the benefits of quality preschool provision. More information about the supports under AIM are available at aim.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for AIM supports is linked to participation in the universal ECCE pre-school programme. ECCE is a universal two-year pre-school programme available to all children within the eligible age range. A child must have reached 2 years and 8 months of age on or prior to 31 August of the relevant programme year to be eligible for the September start date, and a child cannot turn 5 years and 6 months of age during the course of the ECCE programme year.</p></reply>

I will set out for the Deputy what is being done in this respect by youth services.</p>  <p>  My Department currently allocates targeted youth funding of &euro;41.8 million via the UBU Your Place Your Space scheme, which became operational on 1 July 2020. The mission of the scheme is to provide out-of-school supports to marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable young people in their communities to enable them to overcome adverse circumstances and achieve their full potential. There is clear evidence that participation in youth work develops a young person's social and personal competencies and fosters their resilience, all of which are preventative measures against antisocial behaviour to which the Deputy refers.</p>  <p>  Funding for the provision of targeted youth services is administered on behalf of my Department by the 16 Education and Training Boards nationwide, which allocate funding via applications to the UBU Your Place Your Space scheme. </p>  <p>  Key to achieving the aims of the scheme is the development of the Area Profile and Needs Assessment Tool. The purpose of this tool is to allow each ETB to avail of quantitative and qualitative information to objectively identify the needs of young people within their functional area. This analysis leads to the development of a Service Requirement which is then used as the basis for discussion between ETBs and service providers in terms of service delivery to meet the needs of young people in the area. The approach ensures that we can target funding and supports to the young people most in need of intervention and that funding is allocated on the basis of evidence-informed need.</p>  <p>  It is advised that any proposed service in the locations referred to by the Deputy wishing to apply for youth funding should liaise with the relevant ETB in the first instance.</p></reply>

The most recent edition was published in March 2021 and covers the period 2019-2020 (www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/berd/businessexpenditureonresearchdevelopment2019-2020/).</p>  <p>  As part of the survey, enterprises were asked to indicate the numbers of staff who devoted any of their time to R&amp;D activities. R&amp;D personnel includes researchers (PhD qualified and others), technicians and other support staff.</p>  <p>  In total, there were 27,755 persons engaged in R&amp;D in Irish enterprises in 2019. Of this total, 59.8% or 16,609 persons were employed as researchers, of which 1,966 were PhD qualified researchers. In addition, there were 6,832 (24.6%) technicians and 4,313 (15.5%) support staff.</p>  <p>  Additionally, 31.5% of enterprises have indicated they are quite likely or very likely to recruit at PhD level in the next 5 years. Furthermore, 62% of all enterprises have indicated they are quite likely or very likely to recruit at Research Masters level, this is the same for all Irish and foreign owned enterprises.</p>  <p>  The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation. There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. These strategies and initiatives include: the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+; the Human Capital Initiative and the July Stimulus package.</p>  <p>  Postgraduate education delivered by higher education institutions is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s research system. In addition to contributing to knowledge, postgraduate researcher education drives participants to develop their own research and innovation skills that can be applied in a range of environments, in academia or industry, at home or abroad. The Irish Research Council funds postgraduates across all disciplines and is an important component in the wider national strategic pursuit of a strong talent pipeline of research graduates. Science Foundation Ireland has commenced a programme to support advanced PhD skills and training, in collaboration with industry, for the new economy. There are currently six of these SFI Centres for Research Training supporting over 700 PhD students in ICT and data analytics. Through the CRTs, students will be equipped with transversal skills including entrepreneurship and innovation to enable them to adapt and react to rapidly evolving workplaces and making them a very attractive skills pipeline for industry. In addition, I recently launched a new funding programme for early career researchers, the SFI-IRC Pathway Programme. The Programme will support talented postdoctoral researchers from all research disciplines to develop their track record and transition to become independent research leaders.</p></reply>

Membership of leading international research organisations is an important mechanism for facilitating this engagement. </p>  <p>  For this reason, the Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 to initiate discussions with several international research organisations. Four organisations were identified &ndash; CERN, the European Southern Observatory, ELIXIR and LOFAR - and membership of three of these organisations has been completed. Ireland continues its consideration of CERN membership.</p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan 2018-2027, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government outlined its intention to review Ireland's membership of CERN.

While the benefits of CERN membership are recognised as significant, the cost is also significant and must be assessed in the context of other Departmental and national investment priorities.</p>  <p>  Following the recent establishment of my new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, CERN membership will be considered in the context of the programme for government and national investment priorities for research and innovation.  Ireland continues its consideration of full and associate CERN membership and my Department remains in contact with CERN officials.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-01a.1200.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060100077#WRT01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 490 and 491 together.</p>  <p>Close collaboration between employers and education and training institutions is critical in the design of upskilling courses to ensure they appropriately address the needs of industry. Employer input should ensure that courses are structured in a manner that meets the operational realities of businesses, including through the use of flexible and online learning. Engagement with industry also provides vital market intelligence with respect to evolving skills needs. Fast moving sectors are reliant on responsive skills development and training solutions to reflect technology, product and service innovation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Skills to Advance initiative was developed in response to evolving skill needs and assists those facing changes in their work due to technology advances, changing work practices and market diversification. Further education and training (FET) opportunities offered through Skills to Advance incorporate digital, socio-emotional and technical skills development to enhance employee skills and support increased productivity in Irish SMEs. </p>  <p>  As part of the Skills to Advance initiative, SOLAS created the Innovation through Collaboration Fund specifically to support collaborative partnerships by ETBs with the private sector, researchers and academics to meet the skills needs for innovation across economic sectors. Two of ten Innovation through Collaboration projects focus on specific challenges in manufacturing; delivering up-to-the-minute skills using flexible delivery methods, and recognising the existing skills and competencies of technicians while providing upskilling pathways for an increasingly digitised workplace. A new call for this fund is due to be issued in July 2021. </p>  <p>  The Advanced Manufacturing Training Centre of Excellence (AMTCE) in Dundalk provides one of the examples of reskilling and upskilling training courses/programmes and services supported by Innovation through Collaboration Fund. Through the AMTCE, Louth Meath ETB (LMETB) is using advanced technologies to provide innovative and creative solutions to address the upskilling needs of those employed in the manufacturing technology areas and to provide employers with the knowledge skills and competencies to make informed decisions regarding planning for the skills requirements of both existing and new employees; including displaced employees, alongside opportunities for reskilling persons who are unemployed. The AMTCE utilises Innovative methodologies to facilitate and deliver training /upskilling, including use of remote, blended online and onsite learning modalities. The AMTCE harnesses innovative technologies such as VR and AI technologies. </p>  <p>  The manufacturing sector is undergoing a significant transformation through the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies such as robotics, AI and additive manufacturing. Adoption of these technologies is key to enabling Irish companies to remain competitive in the face of global competition and to drive value-add product and service innovation. There is a need to upskill the existing workforce to enable companies to adopt and utilise advanced technologies to support and enhance business competitiveness. The growing need for advanced skills within the manufacturing sector also represents a significant opportunity for people to establish new careers in the sector through appropriate reskilling. The AMTCE is addressing these needs through the provision of high-quality training based on industry needs through flexible delivery mechanisms. The AMTCE centre will provide access to state-of-art equipment to ensure learners receive high quality hands-on training which is highly valued by employers. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Innovation through Collaboration Fund, funding has also been secured by Cavan Monaghan ETB (CMETB) to progress the development of a new FET Centre of Excellence in Supply Chain Logistics and Procurement supporting business transformation and workforce skills being developed in Cavan to support the North East region and nationally. This project is part of a &euro;3 million investment for local projects under the Border Enterprise Development Fund, an economic stimulus package established for the border region, and additional funding from SOLAS and my Department. The new training centre, which will be located at CMETB&rsquo;s FET Campus in Cavan, will focus on areas such as robotics, 3D Printing, Internet of Things, Blockchain Technology, Big Data Analytics and Drone Technology. The project is a direct response to current industry requirements and emerging skills needs in the region, with a vision to positively impact the region&rsquo;s competitiveness, job security and employment growth. </p>  <p>  A capital investment programme in the FET sector is also being rolled out. Among the priorities being addressed are funding for infrastructure and equipment to support reskilling and upskilling needs.</p></reply>

Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum which supports circa 14,000 students.  This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. As part of the package of COVID supports provided by Government last year, &euro;10 million was allocated to an Access Funding package of which &euro;8.1 million was allocated to the Student Assistance Fund. This brought the 2020 SAF allocation to &euro;18.2 million</p>  <p>  In all cases, HEIs are responsible for targeting the available resources at those students most in need.</p>  <p>  PhD students are eligible to apply for the SAF during the first four years of their studies.  PhD students who have completed four years of their studies may also be considered eligible for support on a case-by-case basis.</p></reply>

Following the meeting, Garda&iacute; engaged with project management companies who are now erecting signage that consumption of alcohol along the Grand Canal is unacceptable. Local Garda management also met with the Docklands Business Forum in February to discuss the issues affecting the area and I understand that a follow up online meeting will be organised prior to the next JPC meeting.</p>  <p>  I am informed that local Garda management utilise all legislation in place to address street crime and anti­-social behaviour, including drug related crime, along the Grand Canal.  This includes a high-visibility uniformed presence in addition to the use of plain clothes Garda&iacute; as appropriate, through overt and covert operations. As of 1 January 2021, a Public Order Unit is deployed every weekend to areas subject to anti-social behaviour and other types of criminal activity.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that during the summer months there will be increased uniformed foot and mountain bike patrols along the Grand Canal under Operation GCD, an operation established to counteract incidents of anti-social behaviour and disruption caused by young people swimming in the Canal during the summer holiday period. I understand that this operation has been positively received by the local community and it is envisioned that this operation will be run again in the coming summer months.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to note that the Department's Justice Plan 2021 contains a number of commitments with regard to tackling anti-social behaviour.  </p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour. A subgroup of this forum has already helped inform a new scheme to tackle the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes and similar sub groups can also be established for other issues where appropriate.</p>  <p>  On 15 April last, Minister McEntee and I launched the new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This new strategy will pursue a collaborative response to the situation of vulnerable children and young people, with a strong focus on diverting them away from offending, and building supports to provide prevention and early intervention.</p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour will also be considered by the Local Community Safety Partnerships which are to be set up in every Local Authority under my Department&rsquo;s new community safety policy. Three pilot partnerships are currently being established in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, Longford and Waterford and will run for the next two years ahead of the nationwide rollout.</p></reply>

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. It is not possible to say what the remaining processing time is for an application that is at an advanced stage. The status of an</p>  <p>  application changes as it moves through the process. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, processing rates have been impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed and we have been unable to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies since March 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Covid-19 disruption, a High Court case, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, also resulted in significant delays and the loss of over six months&rsquo; processing time.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

This was the most serious outbreak to occur within the prison system to date and resulted in 38 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the general prisoner population. </p>  <p>  The outbreak was managed in line with the Prison Service Contingency Plan for the Management of Covid-19, which sets out the actions and measures to be implemented in such situations. The outbreak was managed by an Outbreak Control Team, led by the Director General, and was successfully contained, once identified, resulting in the return of a more normal regime on 21 May, 2021.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Prison Service that prisoners continue to send and receive post throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. During the mass testing process which occurs during an outbreak, however, all outgoing post is suspended. </p>  <p>  During the outbreak in Mountjoy Prison, incoming post continued to be accepted, was reviewed by the Censor&rsquo;s Office and delivered as normal. I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that as the prison has exited from the outbreak regime, the outgoing postal services within the prison are again operating as normal.</p>  <p>  With regard to prisoner property, I am also advised that, due to infection control restrictions, and the fact that physical visits remained suspended, it is currently the case that family members cannot drop prisoner property off at the prison. Property is only accepted by post and all property is quarantined for seven days before distribution to prisoners. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Contingency Plan, in situations where there is a positive case in the general prison population, all prisoner movement in a prison is restricted while testing, contact tracing and assessment of the risk of the spread of the infection continues. Prisoners involved in the provision of services within the prison (kitchen, laundry etc.) continue to work with an enhanced level of PPE providing they are not a close contact of any confirmed case. Prisoners are fed and medicated at their door and are permitted to leave their cell in a controlled manner to make telephone calls.</p>  <p>  Once the results of first round testing of all prisoners and all staff are received, any prisoners with negative test results have a degree of regime restored which strives to meet the minimum out of cell time provision of two hours. Positive prisoners and their close contacts are isolated or quarantined in accordance with HSE guidance. </p>  <p>  The measures implemented by the Prison Service have impacted the traditional manner of service delivery by the Psychology and Addiction Counselling Services. Notwithstanding the challenges imposed by managing traditionally close-contact services during a pandemic, it is important to note that these services have not been suspended at anytime to date. The Prison Service continues to provide a range of therapeutic, support and counselling services to prisoners. The primary forms of counselling are provided by the Prison Service Psychology Service and the Merchant&rsquo;s Quay Ireland Addiction Counselling Service. These services have remained in place throughout the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The restrictions imposed by Covid-19 have required the development of new ways of working to support prisoners. These prisoner support services have adapted working arrangements to respond innovatively to maximise opportunities for prisoner engagement by employing a combination of mediums including telephony, video-link and one-to-one contact, where deemed clinically necessary. </p></reply>

In order to grant a prisoner enhanced remission, the Minister must be satisfied that the prisoner is less likely to re-offend and is better able to re-integrate into the community.</p>  <p>  A prisoner can apply to the Minister for Justice for Enhanced Remission under Rule 59 of Statutory Instrument no 252 of 2007 (the Prison Rules), as amended by Statutory Instrument No 385 of 2014 by completing an Enhanced Remission Application Form, which is available in all prisons.  An acknowledgement letter is then sent to the prisoner informing them of receipt of their application and an approximate date on which a decision will be made on the Enhanced Remission Application. </p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that if the application is approved the prisoner will receive a letter informing them of their new release date from the Minister. If the application is declined, a letter will also issue to the prisoner informing them of this decision.</p></reply>

These services remain in place throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  In order to contain the risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic, a range of measures, including restrictions on the type of access to prisons and prisoners has been required to protect the prison population in line with public health advice. These measures have impacted the traditional manner of service delivery by the Psychology and Addiction Counselling Services. However, notwithstanding the challenges imposed by managing traditionally close-contact services during a pandemic, it is important to note that these services have not been suspended at any time to date. </p>  <p>  The restrictions imposed by COVID-19 have required the development of new ways of working to support prisoners.

All prisons and prison-based services have displayed flexibility and adaptability and have used all mediums available to engage with the prison population. </p>  <p>  In order to maintain a safe environment and limit the spread of infection for prisoners and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has not been possible to permit access to prisons for some additional external community-based offender support, and peer support services and programmes. </p>  <p>  However, where possible, video-link appointments with some of these community-based services have been facilitated in line with the recommendations of the community integration plan and identified needs of the particular prisoner. </p>  <p>  Access to prisons for external services remains under continuous review and will be guided by public health advice to minimise the risk of infection to people who live and work in prisons. </p>  <p>  In terms of accessing rehabilitative services prior to release, the Prison Service has dedicated prison officers called Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) Coordinators which are operational in all prisons and open centres. Additional ISM Coordinators work in partnership with the Probation Service to manage prisoners selected for participation in the Joint Agency Response to Crime, Community Support and Community Return Schemes. </p>  <p>  These Integrated Sentence Management Coordinators are supported by prison management and the prison-based multi-disciplinary team, which includes the Psychology Service, the Education Service, the Work Training Service, the Chaplaincy Service, the Probation Service, the Training &amp;amp; Employment Service, the Resettlement Service, the Addiction Service and the Healthcare team, who work together with operational staff to deliver sentence management and services to prisoners.</p></reply>

As such, since the start of the pandemic, it has not always been possible to permit consistent access to prisons for the external community-based organisations.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service is currently carrying out a risk assessment to determine when and how the restrictions put in place in recent months can be eased, while controlling the risk of the spread of infection and ensuring good order and security in the prisons.</p>  <p>  The risk assessment currently being undertaken includes reviewing the physical access for community-based organisations that provide in-reach services to prisons, including Traveller peer support services, prison links workers and visitor centre supports. Where possible, video-link appointments with some of the external community-based services have been facilitated in line with the recommendations of the prisoner&rsquo;s sentence plan and identified needs. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that prison-based services, including prisoner healthcare, training and education services, psychology, addiction counselling services and resettlement services continue to be available within the prisons. To mitigate against the impact of these services not being consistently available in a traditional manner, I understand the Prison Service has put in place a dedicated phone service for prisoners to reach out to chaplains, psychologists and addiction counsellors and that it has increased the use of technology to ensure these essential services continue. </p>  <p>  The Prison Service has continued to facilitate access to prisons and prisoners for those organisations with a statutory role such as the Office of the Inspector of Prisons and Prison Visiting Committees to ensure continued oversight during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  If there is a particular advocacy group the Deputy would like to bring to my attention and that of the Prison Service I would be happy to receive that information. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-01a.1270.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060100078#WRU00700"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, restorative justice is a criminal justice process which has been shown to help victims recover from crime, reduce reoffending and save public resources and it is now widely accepted that restorative justice is compatible with the traditional criminal justice systems of both common law and civil law jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to work with all criminal justice agencies to build capacity to deliver restorative justice safely and effectively. In this context, the Probation Service has formally recognised restorative justice since the 1990s as one method within a suite of measures to provide an effective response to crime. In 2000, two dedicated community based projects were established; the Restorative Justice Service, and Restorative Justice in the Community, both of which have since extended their catchment areas and now offer services across the Greater Dublin area, as well as Tipperary, Laois and Offaly, respectively. These were established and funded through the Probation Service and both projects provide a restorative justice service to the courts through the use of reparation panels and /or victim offender mediation.</p>  <p>  Significant developments since then include a report of the National Commission on Restorative Justice which was published in 2009 and the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group published in 2014. Both reports supported the wider application of Restorative Justice in probation practice. The Commission's report recommended that the Probation Service continue to be the lead agency in implementing the wider application of restorative justice.</p>  <p>  In addition, Section 78 of the Children Act (2001) made provision for the introduction of the Probation Family Conference. Following the commencement of the Act in 2005, this was rolled out through Young Persons Probation, a dedicated part of the Probation Service established to deliver the community sanctions provided for in the Act. While conferencing has now been integrated in to the supervision of some young people, the number of referrals from the courts has declined in recent years.</p>  <p>  More recent developments in this area include the establishment in 2018 of the dedicated Restorative Justice and Victims Services Unit in the Probation Service in response to the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017. Furthermore, the Joint Action Plan for the  Management of Offenders 2019-2021 also contains a commitment to develop joint arrangements, including victim/offender mediation, for providing victims of crime with opportunities for positive, restorative responses to the harm they have experienced.</p>  <p>  The Probation Service and my Department are stakeholders in a four year cross-European project (2019-2023), Restorative Justice: Strategies for Change (RJS4C), with partners from ten countries collaborating to implement the Council of Europe Recommendation that restorative justice should be available at any stage of the Criminal Justice process to any victim and any offender. To this end, the RJS4C has produced an Restorative Justice Collective Strategy for Ireland 2019-2023 to promote and increase awareness and accessibility to Restorative Justice.</p>  <p>  The delivery of Restorative Justice safely and effectively is one of the strategic objectives for the Department over the next three years. Five high level actions have been identified and outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, two of which have been completed to date, including the mapping of the current state of play of Restorative Justice and the activation of a Restorative Justice case study website. In January this year Minister of State Browne launched restorativejustice.ie. which is funded by the Department. This website maps the use of Restorative Justice in criminal justice in Ireland and contains over 35 case studies of both restorative justice and restorative practice and other resources.</p>  <p>  Further actions planned for quarter three and four include; the development of options for an appropriate mechanism and process to create awareness and availability of Restorative Justice at all stages of the criminal justice system, with consistency of service ensuring quality in training and practice; consultations with stakeholders; and the finalisation of a policy paper. It is intended to publish the policy proposals by year end.</p>  <p>  To further progress and deliver on the above, it is proposed that an Action Plan will be developed by my Department and the Probation Service this year. Key components will include establishing a mechanism and process to create greater awareness and availability of Restorative Justice interventions at all stages of the criminal justice system and further training and development for those delivering Restorative Justice interventions - ensuring consistency and quality of service provision. In accepting this as a policy driver, the main challenge to applying it in practice is national accessibility and consultation with key stakeholders which will be central to development of the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is also important to note that the Department&rsquo;s plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, Supporting A Victim's Journey, also contains commitments to scope requirements for a more integrated consistent, visible and high quality Restorative Justice service for vulnerable victims who wish to pursue that pathway.</p></reply>

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities, while working closely with international law enforcement partners.</p>  <p>  The National Drugs Strategy, "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025 ", is unique among national drugs strategies across EU Member States in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at a community level.</p>  <p>  The Strategy includes an action (4.1.42) which specifically relates to strengthening the effectiveness of the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme. The programme, which was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN) to respond to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation, has been implemented on a national level since 2013. In addition, the Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, includes a commitment to support the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regard drug-related intimidation as a hugely serious issue which impacts significantly on communities throughout Ireland. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advise people to seek help and support from their local Garda&iacute;, even where a person has felt compelled to pay money to those who engage in drug related intimidation.</p>  <p>  In dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the utmost regard to the safety and most effective means to afford the person or family subject to the threat the best level of security, advice and support. Confidentiality and security of the persons concerned are paramount for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with reports under the programme.</p>  <p>  In Dublin's North East Inner City specifically, there has been work done by the NEIC Programme Implementation Board on the issue of drug-related intimidation through the Ana Liffey Drug Project. This work is being taken forward by a sub group of the Implementation Board.</p>  <p>  I consulted with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the Deputy's query on the number of times support has been sought from and provided under the drug related intimidation reporting programme since it was established. As the Deputy will appreciate, I am informed by the Garda authorities that this information is highly sensitive and not suitable for release into the public domain.</p></reply>

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

This decision will be communicated in writing. In the meantime, the Deportation Order remains valid and in place and the person concerned is still required to present to the GNIB on any dates specified by them.</p>  <p>  My Department has adopted a pragmatic and compassionate approach to immigration arrangements in the context of COVID-19.

One of these sub groups is focused on meeting the training needs of a wide range of front-line staff and professionals, including legal professionals.</p>  <p>  Work in this subgroup in ongoing and the funding required to develop and deliver the training under the O'Malley Review recommendations will be discussed once it has been established what training is currently provided and what additional training is needed.</p>  <p>  A representative from the Bar Council of Ireland sits on this group. As the Deputy is aware, the Council of The Bar of Ireland is the representative body for barristers who are members of the Law Library. The Bar of Ireland's existing Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programme is robust and equipped to incorporate relevant multidisciplinary training, as envisaged by the O'Malley Review. The CPD programme already incorporates training for barristers dealing with vulnerable witnesses, and several seminars and workshops have taken place over recent months and years.</p>  <p>  The Bar of Ireland has indicated that they will develop a course of Continuing Professional Development suitable for barristers in line with the recommendations of the O'Malley Review.

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  All non-EEA nationals are required to keep their permission to remain in the State up to date at all times, and to have such permission registered. Failure to do so, may adversely affect an application for a certificate of naturalisation.</p>  <p>  A person who has made an application for citizenship is permitted to take reasonable breaks from the State for the purposes of holidays or family reasons. However, to take up an offer of employment in another country would not be in keeping with this concession.

These licences have a validity period of three years.</p><p>Therefore, they remain valid and financial approval may be sought any time up to 2024, and the site planted thereafter. The 675ha mentioned refers to tree planting  which has been paid for this year, up to the end of April. A site may be planted and an application for grant-aid may be submitted but it is only counted in our figures as planted when the payment claim is submitted, approved and paid.</p><p>As regards the carry over of 4,500 approved hectares, it is entirely up to applicants whether they wish to realise the licence granted. I encourage all applicants to do so and to avail of the generous premiums available for afforestation. The Department has written to sectoral representatives to consider whether anything else can be done to improve the conversion from approval to planting.</p><p>As regards the commitment to issue 4,500 licences this year, an increase of 75% on last year,  the proportional estimated breakdown presented was based on those issued in 2020 i.e. 65% of forestry licences issued were tree felling; 20% afforestation and 15% forest roads and is an estimate. This output remains our commitment.</p><p>As regards the breakdown of tree felling licences issued between Coillte and the private sector, last year 49.62% were private and 50.38% were Coillte. I remind the Deputy that the Department regularly publishes an extensive range of forestry statistics on the Department&rsquo;s pages of the Government of Ireland website.</p></reply>

From that date, investors in the European Union, including Ireland, are free to invest in sugar producing capacity if they wish.  </p>  <p>  Since 2006, a number of groups have expressed an interest in the redevelopment of the sugar sector, two of whom prepared desktop feasibility studies between 2010 and 2011.  In their findings, both proposals sought to develop a new sugar and bioethanol production facility with capital costs, estimated at the time, of between &euro;250 and &euro;400 million.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Beet Ireland sought to engage with interested growers in an equity partnership proposal to develop a sugar processing facility in the southeast. However the group announced in June 2019 that it was postponing its plans. </p>  <p>  The Department continues to monitor market trends in the sector but it must be noted that the landscape has completely changed since Ireland exited sugar production and EU sugar quotas were abolished. Sugar prices remain depressed due to an oversupply in the world market. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that any proposals to re-establish sugar production must be industry-led and would need to be supported by a robust business case, having regard to low price being achieved globally for sugar and associated market issues, to attract the substantial level of funding required to support and underpin a new start-up of the scale required to re-establish the sector in Ireland.  </p></reply>

The legal interpretation you have quoted is not one which is shared by the Department.</p><p>Notwithstanding, continuing additional measures are regularly taken to further enhance and safeguard animal welfare during transport. In 2020, this included prohibiting transport in temperatures of 30&deg;C or greater, increased space in lorries for young calves, and a requirement on drivers to retrain every three years instead of 10 years. These measures were further enhanced in 2021 with a minimum of 40kg bodyweight set for calves to be exported, and a ban introduced on animal transport to certain countries in July and August, and December/January to avoid extreme temperatures.</p><p>Furthermore, Teagasc has begun an intensive research project aiming to help establish ways to further improve welfare during transport, including feeding a high-energy, slow-release meal before transport. In early May, Teagasc scientists accompanied a consignment of calves to Cherbourg to carry out a preliminary study of the scientific indicators of welfare before, during and after their ferry voyage with a view to  starting to amass a body of evidence on what further interventions would best enhance their welfare and comfort <i>en route</i>.</p><p>This trade is important to Irish farming and is highly valued by the farming community as it provides an outlet for dairy calves, which have a limited market in Ireland. These calves are highly valued by European farmers and arrive in good health and welfare conditions relative to calves from other countries: a Dutch peer-reviewed scientific study has shown that farms in the Netherlands which raise mostly Irish-origin calves require significantly less antibiotic usage than those from other countries, indicating more robust health and welfare.</p><p>Finally, the Programme for Government contains an undertaking to provide additional funding to support animal welfare in the coming years to which I am fully committed. In this regard, in December 2020, I announced record funding of &euro;3.2 million to 101 animal welfare organisations throughout the country.</p></reply>

This will be a collaborative process involving wide stakeholder consultation.  As part of this, the legal requirements and available options for the awarding of contracts for the next programme will be examined and a decision will be taken based on the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and the need to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients.  </p></reply>

It can also help revitalise our rural town if remote working hubs are developed in their centres. </p><p>My Department continues to invest significantly in the development of new Hub facilities across the country. Since 2015, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme has provided &euro;7.8m in funding to hubs and hub-related projects. Many of the successful projects involve the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as Enterprise and Co-Working Hubs. </p><p>I recently announced funding of &euro;15 million that is available under the 2021 Town &amp;amp; Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS). In line with Our Rural Future, a key focus of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to renovate derelict and vacant buildings in our town centres, and specifically supports bringing vacant properties in town centres back into use or repurpose existing community or publicly owned buildings as remote working hubs. </p><p>I have increased the maximum grant available under this Scheme to &euro;500,000 to permit projects of significant scale to be funded. The TVRS It is administered by Local Authorities, who are currently seeking expressions of interest for suitable projects from local groups in towns and villages within their respective counties. The closing date set for receipt of completed applications by my Department is 16 July.</p><p>I should stress that the purchase of a building in isolation, without clearly defined proposals to bring it back into use, is unlikely to be successful. </p><p>In addition to funding through the Town and Village Scheme, &euro;65m has also been invested in hub projects through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund since 2018. A further call for projects under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will issue later this year</p><p>There are a range of other initiatives outlined in Our Rural Future which will contribute to addressing vacancy in our towns and villages. In particular, an Inter-departmental Group has been established to develop a Town Centre First Approach, with a focus on vacancy and dereliction, and to bring forward recommendations to Government.</p></reply>
