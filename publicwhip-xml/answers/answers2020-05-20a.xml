These mediums are trusted as both news sources and fixtures of the Irish media landscape, and allow the dissemination of information in a detailed and effective manner to as wide an audience as possible. The press and radio programme has been augmented by a cross-Government coordinated programme on digital media.</p><p>Both national and local media have been deployed to get the balance right between main national news sources, which help to communicate information which is important to all of Ireland, and local news sources, which resonate particularly strongly with local communities.</p><p>The communications programmes run as part of the Covid 19 response include Community Call, Business Supports, Social Distancing in Public Spaces, Large Scale restrictions, publication of the Roadmap for Reopening of Society and Business<i></i>and measures being lifted during Phase 1 of the roadmap.</p><p>The advertising space is booked through existing contracts which were procured through the Office of Government Procurement (OGP).  </p></reply>

This was the fourth such meeting, with previous videoconferences having taken place on 10, 17 and 26 March.</p><p>In our meetings, we focussed on five strategic areas of work in which it makes sense to cooperate together:</p><p>-  Limiting the spread of the virus; </p><p>-  ensuring the supply of medicines, equipment and goods;</p><p>-  supporting research;</p><p>-  tackling socio-economic consequences; and</p><p>-  co-operating to bring citizens home from other countries.</p><p>At our most recent meeting on 23 April, we welcomed the Joint European Roadmap towards the lifting of COVID-19 containment measures published by the Commission on 15 April.  It sets out a principles-based and science-led approach to re-opening our societies and our economies and aligns with the approach we have taken as a Government to date.</p><p>We also endorsed an economic package, agreed by the Eurogroup, worth up to &euro;540 billion, and asked that it be operational in June.  This comprises three safety nets, one for citizens, one for companies, and one for Member States. </p><p>Looking beyond the immediate crisis, we agreed on the need to put in place a Recovery Fund commensurate to the scale of the challenge we will face in rebuilding our economies and businesses, and getting our citizens back to work, as soon as circumstances permit.</p><p>On 8 May, I spoke with the Prime Minister of Sweden, Stefan L&ouml;fven.  We discussed the current Covid-19 crisis and the importance of ongoing discussions at EU level on a recovery fund and on the MFF.  We also discussed the current state of play in the EU-UK negotiations on the future partnership, we well as implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Irish Protocol. </p><p>PM L&ouml;fven took the opportunity to thank Ireland for assisting in the repatriation of Swedish citizens from India.</p><p>On 17 May, I spoke with President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.  We discussed the detailed work that the Commission is undertaking in analysing the impact of the Covid19 crisis, sector-by-sector and region-by-region, and its work on a Recovery Fund. We also discussed how this Fund will interact with the Union&rsquo;s budget for the next seven years, and the Commission&rsquo;s plan to bring forward a new proposal in that regard in the near future.</p></reply>

I offered my sympathies to him on his recent illness and hospitalisation, and I also congratulated him on the birth of his son.  </p><p>We discussed the general Covid 19 situation and our respective experiences in seeking to contain the virus and manage its impacts.  We shared information on our respective plans to start easing restrictions. We also talked about how Covid related travel restrictions might be adapted, and agreed that we both want the common travel area to be respected in our respective approaches.</p><p>We discussed Brexit and noted the state of play after last week&rsquo;s round of negotiations.  We  also recalled our commitment to working together on strengthening North - South and East -West links after Brexit, and looked forward to being able to make progress in the period ahead. </p><p>I also spoke with First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill on Friday, 15th May, when I informed them of the Government plans to start easing the Covid related restrictions from the 18th of May as set out in the Roadmap.  We also discussed ongoing North South cooperation on dealing with Covid and the Memorandum of Understanding <font color="#14171A">agreed to underpin and strengthen North South co-operation on the public health response to the pandemic</font>.</p><p>I had previously spoken by phone with the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 19 March.  The main focus of our discussion on that occasion was the Covid 19 situation and the actions being taken by the two Governments, including in particular in relation to closing schools.  We both expressed the wish that political parties in Northern Ireland work collaboratively in the recently restored Executive, and briefly discussed the British proposals on legacy issues.</p></reply>

This flexibility from the UN resulted from the immediate and coordinated case advanced at mission level, by the Chief of Staff and at UN Headquarters, by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. </p>  <p>  Given the size of the contingent and the requirements of the mission, the UNIFIL rotations take place in two stages, (commonly known as &ldquo;chalks&rdquo;). </p>  <p>  I am advised that the indications at present are that the first chalk will take place in the latter part of June and the second in early July. However, contacts with the UN in New York are continuing.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the impact the UN decision is having on Defence Force members, as well as the anxiety that this has caused for families.  In this connection, I am advised by the military authorities that personnel in mission areas are being briefed as information comes to hand.  Personnel and families will continue to be advised and updated by the Defence Forces as further information becomes available.  </p></reply>

The scheme will allow for initial re-enlistment for a minimum of six months and up to 3 years. </p>  <p>   The re-enlistment of former personnel with the relevant skills and experience was one of the many actions being pursued to address the skill shortages in the PDF. It is a medium to long term initiative which pre-dates the COVID crisis, but which also facilitates the COVID response. While the legislation to permit re-enlistment had been published in the term of the last Dail, the enactment of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 includes this provision. The scheme will support the Defence Forces in responding to, and sustaining their response to, the current COVID-19 crisis and beyond. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions were agreed with the Representative Association, PDFORRA on 1 April last. Under those terms and conditions, individuals who wish to re-enlist will serve for a specific period and for a specific purpose which will involve the use of a particular skill or area of expertise which cannot currently be met through the use of existing military resources. In addition, individuals will be required to meet a range of general eligibility criteria including medical and physical fitness to ensure they are capable of performing normal military duties.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that anyone who leaves of their own volition during the period of their enlistment up to three years will not be required to make any payment in order to discharge. </p>  <p>  Since announcing the scheme, which is still ongoing, 614 applications have been received. </p>  <p>  The Military Authorities have advised that 502 applicants have been deemed eligible at the application stage and are going forward for assessment. Upon completion of this process, and having regard to specific shortages which exist within the Permanent Defence Force, the Chief of Staff will then make recommendations to me as to those that should be re-enlisted.  </p></reply>

I take note, however, of comments made by Prime Minister Netanyahu in the Knesset on 17 May, regarding the annexation of territory in the West Bank, which is part of the occupied Palestinian territory, as well as the provisions on annexation in the political agreement reached during coalition negotiations in Israel.  </p>  <p>  As I stated publicly on 23 April: "I think it important, as a friend and partner of Israel, to be very clear about the gravity of any such step. Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter, whenever and wherever it occurs, in Europe&rsquo;s neighbourhood or globally. This is a fundamental principle in the relations of states and the rule of law in the modern world. No one state can set it aside at will. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to a negotiated two-state solution that ends the occupation that began in 1967, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States, on the basis of international law, the internationally-agreed parameters and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. This accords with the European Union&rsquo;s long-standing position. We firmly believe that this is the only outcome which will provide long term security, freedom and prosperity to both peoples."</p>  <p>  The unilateral annexation by Israel of any part of the occupied Palestinian territory would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland or the international community more generally. I have in the past made my views on this clear to Israeli leaders, including during my most recent visit to Israel in December 2019. My officials continue to convey our views to the Israeli authorities at appropriate opportunities. </p>  <p>  The Middle East Peace Process, including the issue of annexation, was discussed at the 15 May videoconference meeting of EU Foreign Ministers. In advance of that meeting, I and senior officials in my Department discussed the issue with a large number of EU Member States to encourage a clear and united position. </p>  <p>  During the VC discussion, the strong view expressed was that annexation was completely unacceptable and, if implemented, would be a grave violation of international law. This is not just a principle that applies to Israel and Palestine but one which is global. I, and many other Ministers, emphasised the need for EU action to deter such a damaging unilateral action, which would inevitably have negative consequences for the EU-Israel relationship. There was broad agreement that the EU and its MS need to engage in outreach with the new Israeli Government and make clear our deep concerns. </p>  <p>  I welcome the very clear statements that have been made on this matter in recent weeks by EU High Representative/Vice President Josep Borrell, who has said that any annexation would constitute a serious violation of international law that could not pass unchallenged. </p>  <p>  I will continue to prioritise this issue, working closely with EU partners and countries in the region.</p></reply>

Although progress has been made in certain areas, there continue to be instances of violations of fundamental freedoms, including the targeting of human rights defenders.  </p>  <p>  Ireland participates actively in the UN Human Rights Council, and regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, both in national statements and in our support of EU Statements, which I believe is the right way to highlight this issue. </p>  <p>  Discussions are still ongoing on how the next session of the UN Human Rights Council will be held, in view of the current situation. No decision has yet been taken on national or EU interventions at that session. In our planning for the next session, we will consider carefully which priorities to set, with a view to focusing the weight of Ireland's efforts, and the Council's attention, on the most grave and troubling situations globally.  </p>  <p>  While the issue of Bahrain has not been raised at the EU Foreign Affairs Council recently, the EU and Bahrain hold regular discussions on human rights issues. At the most recent informal EU-Bahrain Human Rights dialogue in November 2019, issues discussed included the right to a fair trial, prison conditions (including the need to ensure adequate medical treatment for prisoners), and the overall human rights situation in the country. The EU continues to follow up directly with the Bahraini authorities; for example, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, recently wrote to the Bahraini Minister for Foreign Affairs specifically highlighting the ongoing detention of Human Rights defenders and the conditions of their detention. </p>  <p>  We also raise our concerns about the human rights situation, and the treatment of detainees in particular, in our bilateral discussions with Bahrain. When I met with the former Bahraini Minister of Foreign Affairs at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2019, I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. Officials from my Department met with a delegation from Bahrain in November 2019 and had an in-depth discussion on prison conditions and the justice system in Bahrain. Among the issues raised were Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the imprisonment of certain individuals, apparently on the basis of opinions they had expressed; and the provision of healthcare for prisoners in Bahrain. The Bahraini officials outlined specific plans to improve prisoners&rsquo; access to healthcare, and my officials continue to follow up on this matter. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

They are illegal under international law, notably being contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention, and actively undermine the prospects for a two-state solution. </p>  <p>  As I have said many times in the D&aacute;il, the regulation of international trade, including in relation to settlement goods, is a matter of exclusive EU competence. The Occupied Territories Bill asks the Government to do something which is not legally in its power. The European Commission confirmed to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence in June of last year that "...the EU has exclusive competence on the common commercial policy, and that as a customs union, the EU applies common arrangements for imports of goods from third countries uniformly across the Union. In principle, only the EU can decide to prohibit the importation of goods and services and not the Member States individually." </p>  <p>  To introduce such an EU-wide ban on the importation of settlement goods would require consensus among EU Member States, and the political will for such a policy does not exist. For that reason, I have focused my energies at EU level on other aspects of the Israel-Palestine issue, in order to ensure the best possible policy outcomes. </p>  <p>  As it stands, however, EU law does already make a meaningful distinction between Israel, and settlements in occupied territory. This distinction has important practical effects. Since settlements are not part of Israel, the EU-Israel Association Agreement does not apply to them. This means that different tariffs apply to goods from settlements, and settlements are not eligible for participation in EU-Israel programmes. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been vigilant to ensure that EU law in this regard is upheld. For example, in 2018, Ireland, as an interested Member State, lodged observations in a case which was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, challenging the implementation of EU rules on the labelling of foodstuffs originating from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. The court&rsquo;s judgment, issued on 12 November 2019, confirmed that foodstuffs originating in territories occupied by the State of Israel, must bear the indication of their territory of origin, and when these products originate from an Israeli settlement, this must also be made clear on the label. Clear and non-misleading indication of origin for certain goods is an essential part of the EU's consumer policy. </p>  <p>  EU law and guidelines on goods from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory clearly differentiate between settlements on the one hand, and Israel, on the other. As such, they are an important part of the EU constribution to the implmentation of UN Security Council Resolution 2334. Ireland will maintain its vigilance to ensure full implementation of these laws and guidelines. </p></reply>

It commissions external expertise in line with national and EU procurement rules in areas where highly specialised skills are not available, in particular where independent evaluation of projects is required. During the course of their engagement, these consultants and experts may prepare reports and other analysis or documentation for the Department.</p>  <p>  In-depth analysis of issues by external experts has informed, and continues to inform, the Department&rsquo;s policies, allowing for a more targeted use of resources and greater accountability in the allocation of budgets.  </p>  <p>  All consultancy procurement in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is carried out in accordance with relevant procurement legislation and EU Directives. This competitive tender process establishes the cost of the work which acts as the limit for the consultancy work. As a public body, the Department complies with the procedures for public procurement laid down in the Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services published by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) in 2019. Consultancy projects are tendered for on the basis of completion of an entire piece of work and not on an hourly basis. Therefore the Department does not mainatain details of the various hourly rates. The Department maintains strict budgetary oversight of all consultancies to ensure that all costs are in line with the relevant tender. </p>  <p>  The Department acts appropriately to prevent, identify and remedy conflicts of interest in the conduct of a procurement procedure to avoid any distortion of competition and to ensure equal treatment of consultancy tenders. The conflict of interest procedure involves ascertaining if Evaluation Committee members have any actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest in participating in the tender evaluation process. Every Committee member is required to complete and sign a conflict of interest declaration in advance of the evaluation process. When a conflict of interest has been declared in advance of evaluation, the nature of the conflict and any deliberations on managing the conflict together with the resolution is recorded in the procurement file.</p>  <p>  A small number of consultancies are engaged directly by our Missions abroad from time to time and in some instances they prepare technical reports relating to Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development aid programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.132.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000108#WRD01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 64, 97, 120 and 129 together.</p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is a temporary emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, intended to maximise staff retention and firm viability by maintaining the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible through this truly exceptional period.  In that regard it is noted that as of 14 May, over 54,100 employers and over 464,400 employees have thus far benefited from the measure.  </p>  <p>  It ultimately gives a sum to employers to cover a portion of their wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by the restrictions that have had to be introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  The sum the employer receives is based on the employees who were on their payroll on 29 February 2020, the net salary such employees received in January and February 2020, as well as the extent to which the employer remains able to continue to discharge their legal obligation to pay their employees&rsquo; salaries.</p>  <p>  The TWSS is built upon historic PAYE returns made to Revenue.  One of the core principles of the scheme that is necessary to prevent abuse is the requirement that the employees for which a claim is submitted must be on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after 29 February 2020, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, whether maternity related or otherwise, that salary cannot be included in the calculation of the sum that is available to the employer under the TWSS.</p>  <p>  The 29 February payroll decision has consequences for many groups, however, the scheme is being administered in a manner that is fully compliant with all relevant legislation and no discriminatory treatment of workers arises.  </p>  <p>  Further, the position in relation to the TWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay.  The question of an individual&rsquo;s employment entitlements following their resumption of work after a period of leave, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee are matters between the employee and the employer &ndash; and the entire period of pregnancy and maternity leave is a special protected period under the law.  </p>  <p>  It is understood that although the employer may not be able to claim the TWSS for a person who has not been on the payroll on 29 February but is entitled to return to work after this date, they remain obliged to honour their obligations as an employer as the full suite of employment rights legislation continues to apply in relation to all employees and their employers for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.</p>  <p>  As regards the operation of the TWSS, I am aware of the matter that has been raised by the Deputies and have instructed officials to re-examine whether such workers may be accommodated at this time within the scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.135.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000108#WRD02100"><p>The Government&rsquo;s priority in so far as the Temporary Wages Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is concerned was and is to ensure that all employers experiencing significant negative economic disruption from COVID-19 can register for and start to receive payment quickly. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once that becomes possible. The scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the public service and non-commercial semi-state sector, this includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce. The main eligibility criteria for the scheme are that:</p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic;</p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020; and, </p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.   </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that following a review of cases since the TWSS commenced, it became apparent that a number of employers have been unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule, but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and were otherwise tax compliant. Given the purpose  of the scheme, Revenue decided, under its care and management provisions, to allow such employers access the scheme provided: </p>  <p>  - the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020</p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and</p>  <p>  - the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.</p>  <p>  The TWSS builds on payroll data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. Where a business qualifies for the TWSS under the revised criteria, the wage subsidies under the scheme are payable for eligible employees in respect of payroll submissions made on or after 24 April 2020, with a pay date on or after 24 April 2020, and are not retrospective.   </p>  <p>  Eligible employers can participate in the scheme in respect of any eligible employees on their payroll at 29 February 2020, including rehired staff who had been temporarily laid off after that date. Where an employee previously laid off has been re-hired, the employee will qualify for the scheme once their claim for social welfare benefit (Pandemic Unemployment Payment/Jobseekers Benefit) is ceased. Eligibility for the scheme can be satisfied by an employer once they meet the relevant criteria, which can be at any point in time during the scheme&rsquo;s duration.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy referred to P30 forms. Such forms are no longer in use following the introduction of PAYE Modernisation.  Section 985G of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out that Revenue issue a monthly statement to the employer outlining a summary of the payroll submissions made by the employer for the month. If no corrective action is taken by the employer, this statement is deemed to be a monthly return by the employer made on the return due date. </p></reply>

Therefore, if the property was at any time suitable for use as a dwelling it would not qualify for the HTB incentive.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that where there is uncertainty regarding whether a property was previously suitable for use as a dwelling, first time buyers intending to undertake such purchases should contact Revenue via My Enquiries and they will consider the application on a case by case basis.  In order for Revenue to make an assessment on whether a dwelling was unfinished and not suitable for use as a dwelling, they would require sufficient evidence from the builder, engineer or other professionals working on the project, about the condition of the dwelling which made it uninhabitable/unfinished.  If there is any other information (photos, etc.) that&rsquo;s relevant in helping Revenue conclude that the property meets the criteria in the legislation, this should also be included.</p></reply>

A repayment of contributions is only permitted in highly limited circumstances, for example due to ill-health, and as such, this would be subject to income tax. </p>  <p>  The policy rationale underpinning this is the State provides generous tax relief on both pension contributions and fund growth to ensure that people have sufficient savings to fund their regular costs and expenses during their retirement. However, on actual drawdown a pension is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal tax rate. In the event of any early encashment of a pension fund the tax relief received must be clawed back. It should also be noted that any refund of pension contributions is governed by the terms of the specific scheme or product.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all matters of policy, while they are monitored on a continuous basis, I do not have any plan at this time to revise these pension arrangements.   </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that a very significant and comprehensive package of measures has already been put in place to assist those who have suffered a loss of income arising from the COVID-19 crisis. This includes the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and bank-related forbearance measures.</p>  <p>  Revenue data from 14 May 2020 show there are over 53,900 employers registered with Revenue and more than 464,400 employees had received at least one payment under TWSS. The data are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at the link: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/registrations/wage-subsidy-scheme-statistics-14-may-2020.pdf.</p>  <p>  Data from the Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection show there were 584,600 people in receipt of a Pandemic Unemployment Payment on 18 May 2020. The data are available at the link: www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/74440/d2d234214f994fe6966afdb28eed1e55.pdf#page=1.</p></reply>

Owners of such vehicles will not be required to reregister the vehicles until the VRT service operated by the NCTS Centres has recommenced. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to put in place an estimated billing process as both the vehicle and the supporting documentation are legally required to be inspected prior to registration.  Any such initiative in respect of the payment of the tax would require a change to primary legislation and significant changes to IT and administrative structures.  Subject to the Government&rsquo;s road map, it is likely that the NCTS Centres will have recommenced a scaled back VRT service by the end of June and any such changes would be disproportionate at this point in time. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by Revenue that registration on the Revenue Online Service of new cars and cars that have been pre-inspected has not been interrupted. </p>  <p>  The question of insurance is a matter for the insurance industry and that of road tax for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

In this regard, I held a teleconference meeting with a representative from the Alliance for Insurance Reform on 1 April to hear the concerns of their membership.</p><p>I, and my officials, have been engaging with the insurance sector in an effort to get some much needed certainty for business policyholders. On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on the 27th of March and indicated amongst other things the following: </p><p>(i) insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  </p><p>(ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed, as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.</p><p>Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on the 3rd of April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close. </p><p>Following on from my correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on the 17th of April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating their customers fairly. I also discussed a range of other insurance related matters on the teleconference, including motor insurance premium refunds, and a statement outlining the nature of my engagement with Insurance Ireland was issued by the Department and can be found here:   </p><p>In addition, the Deputies should note that the Central Bank wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. The key messages that the Bank conveyed are as follows:</p><p>- Insurers must put forward consumer-focussed solutions on policy payment breaks, rebates and claims. </p><p>- While most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. </p><p>- The Central Bank expects the CEOs of Irish authorised firms to take responsibility for the oversight of how their firm is managing determinations of whether claims are covered or not in the context of COVID-19. </p><p>I also understand that the Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.</p><p>In conclusion on this issue, I have already set out to the House that I strongly believe that insurers should treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally and honour those elements of the policies covered including business interruption claims in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  The Deputies should note however that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank have any role in adjudicating on such matters.  If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or litigation.</p><p>With regard to the other issue raised on insurance cover for businesses required to close during the Covid-19 emergency, I and my officials have also had extensive engagements with the industry.  In that regard, it should be noted that in my letter of the 27th of March, I also requested that Insurance Ireland press its members to provide some reliefs to their customers to alleviate the pressures brought on as a result of the current situation and for insurers to have a common approach on how they are supporting their business customers in this difficult time.  The outcome of this engagement is an agreement that I announced on the 10th of April whereby most of the key insurers in the Irish market - namely Allianz, AIG, AXA, FBD, Liberty Insurance, RSA, Travelers Insurance and Zurich - will apply the following common measures which will be available to their business customers:</p><p><b>Forbearance</b></p><p><b>- </b>Insurers will reduce premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer Liability/ Public Liability and Commercial Motor.</p><p>- Insurers will allow up to 28 days after renewal for payment.</p><p><b>Business Premises</b></p><p>- Insurers will maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings/ premises not in use due to COVID-19 restriction (for a maximum of 90 days). Appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required.  </p><p>- Insurers will support requests for a change of property use during the crisis.</p><p>It is important that businesses contact their insurers or brokers to avail of these offers.  </p><p>In terms of this agreement, I believe that it should provide some assistance to businesses.  I have asked Insurance Ireland to put in place a mechanism, which will provide proof of delivery on these commitments.  My view, is that it is in Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s interest to put in place a credible tracking mechanism, as they need to be able to demonstrate that the 10 April agreement is being implemented properly.  I have also asked my officials intend to monitor the implementation of the agreement, both through the activity tracker, as well as through the regular engagement with other relevant stakeholders such as the Alliance for Insurance Reform.</p><p>Finally, with regard to any further engagement with the insurance industry, it should be noted that my officials are in regular contact with Insurance Ireland and the Central Bank and keep me updated on developments. For now, while I don't have any meeting arranged with individual insurance company CEOs, I am keeping that issue under review as matters develop.</p></reply>

On 14 May, Revenue published updated and expanded statistical information in relation to the scheme. All of these statistics are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/number-of-taxpayers-and-returns/covid-19-wage-subsidy-scheme-statistics.aspx.</p><p>The data published include the cost of the scheme to date as well as detailed information on employers and employees in receipt of payments under the scheme. </p><p>As at 14 May, Revenue report that:</p><p>- There are over 53,900 employers registered with Revenue for the TWSS.</p><p>- Over 47,300 employers have already received subsidy payments under the TWSS.</p><p>- Over 464,400 employees have already received at least one payment under the TWSS.</p><p>- The cumulative value of payments made under the TWSS is &euro;936 million. </p><p>Regarding the Deputy's question on the number of employers, registered for tax purposes as off-shore that have availed of the wage subsidy scheme; and the cost of the scheme in these cases; the TWSS is only available to employers registered in Ireland that had employees included on their Irish payroll in February 2020 and whose business activities are being adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme does not apply to the public service or non-commercial semi-state sector.  </p><p>Regarding the Deputy's question on the number of transnational corporations availing of the wage subsidy scheme; the number of their employees on the scheme; and the sectors of industry in which they operate, the available information at the above link includes the proportions of employers and employees assigned to Revenue&rsquo;s Large Corporates Division that are currently availing of TWSS (0.7% of employers and 14.6% of employees)), many of these employers are likely to be multinational companies. Sectoral breakdowns of TWSS employers and employees are also included in the statistics. </p><p>Regarding the Deputy's question on the number of workers on TWSS whose earnings are below &euro;205 and &euro;350, respectively, the information published at the above link shows the available wage distribution for TWSS employees (Table 5 of the 14 May statistics, for example). </p><p>Finally, regarding the Deputy's question on the number of employees that have been placed on the wage subsidy scheme; and whose earnings are below &euro;350 from the scheme; and are not in receipt of any top-up from their employer; and the amount of weekly subsidy these workers receive from the scheme in bands below &euro;350, Table 11 in the statistics of 23 April, 30 April and 7 May and Table 6 in the 14 May statistics (all published at the link above) includes the available analysis of employer &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; payments to employees. </p><p>Revenue has advised me that it is continuing to undertake further analysis of TWSS and will publish updated and expanded statistics on a regular basis. These updates will also be published at the link above.</p></reply>

The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle.</p><p>A number of amendments  were made to the taxation of REITs as part of Finance Act 2019, to ensure the regime operates as intended.  The obligation to deduct REIT Dividend Withholding Tax was extended to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. New measures were introduced to require the proceeds of property disposals to be re-invested in property assets or distributed within a set period. The deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. Finance Act 2019 also introduction of the &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; test when calculating the REIT profits available for distribution. This test is common throughout the taxes act, its inclusion in the REIT legislation ensures fair and consistent treatment for those investing in Irish property.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that that my officials prepared a report on Real Estate Investment Trusts, Irish Real Estate Funds and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market in 2019. This report was completed and presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July 2019 and informed the changes introduced in Finance Act 2019, referred to above. I therefore do not believe it to be an appropriate time to conduct a further review of the REIT regime, however I can confirm that my Department actively monitors developments in the property market on an ongoing basis. The aforementioned report can be viewed at the following link: . </p><p>In relation to the further details supplied, it is not appropriate for the Minister for Finance to comment on the remuneration of specific individuals.</p></reply>

Tax is deducted at the standard income tax rate, currently 20%. It should be noted that PSWT is not an additional tax.  It is instead a payment on account, which is set against the final Income Tax or Corporation Tax liability of the service provider. This is the basis on which PSWT is applied to payments made by the HSE to dentists for the provision of dental services.</p>  <p>  There is a wide range of bodies which deduct PSWT and an equally wide range of payments for professional services to which it applies. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to suspend the operation of PSWT by one entity for the provision of one particular service.</p>  <p>  However, the legislation governing PSWT does provide for the Revenue to make interim refunds, in specified circumstances, within the same tax year as that in which the PSWT is deducted.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that special arrangements have been put in place to accelerate the processing of interim refunds during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  These new arrangements provide for the submission of these claims electronically through Revenue&rsquo;s MyEnquiries service and this will speed up the provision of refunds to applicants. </p>  <p>  To accelerate interim refunds of PSWT Revenue will accept refund claims via MyEnquiries where legible copies of the original F45 and F50 documents are attached. Refunds will be processed on this basis without the requirement to be supported by original F45 documents.  All original F45 documents will need to be retained as there will be checks at a future date. </p>  <p>  Additionally and in a situation where the relevant F45 form cannot be issued to the specified person due solely to the current Covid-19 circumstances then, for the purposes of attachment to a MyEnquiries refund claim, a written statement issued by the accountable person to the specified person setting out the relevant information will suffice. </p>  <p>  Full details of these Covid-19 interim arrangements are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/covid19/revenue-services.aspx.    </p>  <p>  All requests for refunds will be given priority attention once received by Revenue</p></reply>

Of necessity, the legislation and the scheme itself were developed very quickly to support the urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees that have been seriously affected by the pandemic. </p>  <p>  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. The changes to Revenue&rsquo;s systems required to fully implement the TWSS have been delivered incrementally since the scheme commenced on 26 March 2020. The latest phase of the scheme implements the revised subsidy rates, as determined by me, in accordance with the legislation and is effective from 4 May 2020 for most employees. This phase is based on providing employers with details of the maximum personal subsidy amount to be paid to individual employees based on their previous average net weekly pay.    </p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that it is aware of the difficulty for employers in accessing TWSS in respect of staff that were rehired after 1 May 2020 and has assured me that it is not related to ceasing employees from the scheme. The implementation of the latest phase of TWSS required a series of calculations to be performed for each employee that was on employers&rsquo; payrolls on 1 May 2020 in order to generate their personal wage subsidy entitlements.

The scheme builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself simply cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees. The core principles of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic, that the employees were on the payroll on 29 February 2020 and that the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by, in general, 15 March 2020.  These requirements of the scheme were critical safeguards against abuse and exploitation of the scheme.   </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that following a review of cases since the TWSS commenced, it became apparent that a number of employers had been unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and are otherwise tax compliant. Given the overarching purpose and objective of the scheme, Revenue announced on 24 April, under its care and management provisions, to allow such employers access the scheme provided: </p>  <p>  - the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, </p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and  </p>  <p>  - the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.</p>  <p>  Where a business qualifies for the scheme under the revised criteria and makes the necessary declaration that it is significantly impacted by the crisis, the wage subsidies under the scheme will be payable for eligible employees in respect of payroll submissions made on or after 24 April 2020, with a pay date on or after 24 April 2020.  However, subsidies for the earlier period are not made retrospectively and there are no plans to alter this.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.194.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000109#WRE01700"><p>As part of the Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operation (TLTRO), banks can borrow from the Eurosystem at favourable terms to incentivise eligible lending to businesses and households. As of 30 April, the Governing Council of the ECB has set the entry rate on the TLTRO programme to be -0.5%. The interest rate then decreases on a scale depending on developments in a bank&rsquo;s eligible lending. The minimum rate on the borrowing can be as low as -1% if a bank exceeds its lending benchmark for eligible lending. </p>  <p>  Access to TLTRO funding is available to banks across the euro area, including to Irish banks, but is optional and is a decision for a bank itself to make. Up to now, take-up from Irish banks in previous TLTRO programs has been limited. Importantly, the TLTRO program does not specify the interest rate at which the bank lending to business (or households) should take place.  However, banks do not just use TLTRO to fund their activity. In practice they utilise a diverse range of funding sources, including consumer deposits, which are relatively more expensive for the bank compared to the funding available under TLTRO.</p>  <p>  Neither the Central Bank of Ireland, the ECB, nor the Government plays a role in determining the interest rate on a loan from a private bank in Ireland. However, one would always expect a spread above borrowing costs to reflect various costs associated with lending, such as credit risk premia, operating costs including credit assessment, and the cost of equity. All of these factors are particularly high in the Irish SME lending market.  Banks are also required to hold an adequate level of capital against SME lending this also contributes to the interest rates charged by banks.</p>  <p>  Separately, banks are offering a payment break up to six months for business and personal customers affected by Covid-19. A payment break as a response to COVID-19 is not identified specifically on credit reports. If a lender agrees to a payment break with no payments at all, then no &ldquo;missed payments&rdquo; will be submitted to the Central Credit Register by the lender during this period.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a suite of measures to assist SMEs during these difficult times. These include measures to help viable businesses access the liquidity that they require. There is a range of Government supports available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. &euro;200 million is currently available for COVID 19 affected customers through the SBCI COVID19 Working Capital Scheme.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, has recently announced the expansion of two SBCI Loan Schemes by &euro;450m to provide an extra &euro;250m for working capital and &euro;200m for longer-term loans, bringing the total allocation to support liquidity in companies affected by the COVID-19 crisis to &euro;650m. The SBCI also has existing supports in place that can help SMEs, including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, which has current lending capacity for SMEs. The Credit Guarantee Scheme supports lending through the provision of an 80% Government Guarantee for qualifying businesses.  The Microfinance Ireland Loan Scheme has also introduced loans of up to &euro;50,000 for micro-SMEs affected by COVID 19.  The expansion of Microfinance Ireland funding by &euro;13m to &euro;20m for COVID-19 loans has also been recently announced with interest rates falling from 7.8% to 4.5%. The Government also recently announced a 2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates.</p></reply>

In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework as set out above, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. A loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is a commercial decision for the lender. Neither the Central Bank nor I can become involved in such decision making. </p>  <p>  Lenders have indicated that they continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Customers should consult the BPFI&rsquo;s COVID-19 Support FAQ on mortgages, or contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.</p></reply>

Payment breaks should be a generally available option to affected borrowers, including those borrowers currently meeting the terms of alternative repayment arrangements. In this regard, regulated entities should ensure approaches are consistent with any existing arrears strategies and operations.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has emphasised that the provisions of the existing consumer protection framework, which is designed to ensure that consumers&rsquo; best interests are protected, particularly in times of financial difficulties, are in place. </p>  <p>  If the customer is not happy with the way their financial institution is dealing with them, they can make a complaint to them and if they are not satisfied with the response received from them, the customer has the option to bring a complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. </p></reply>

The latest phase of the scheme implements the revised subsidy rates, as determined by me, in accordance with the legislation and is effective from 4 May 2020 for most employees. This phase is based on providing employers with details of the maximum personal subsidy amount to be paid to individual employees based on their previous average net weekly pay.</p><p>On 15 April 2020, I, as Minister for Finance, announced further updates to the TWSS. Included in the updates were measures to increase the wage subsidy for certain lower paid employees.  In effect, for those employees with previous net pay of less than &euro;586 per week, the amount of the temporary wage subsidy shall not exceed &euro;410 per week in accordance with the following principles:</p><p>- an 85% subsidy shall be payable in the case of employees whose average net weekly pay does not exceed &euro;412; and </p><p>- a flat rate subsidy of up to &euro;350 shall be payable in the case of employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;412 but not more than &euro;500.</p><p>In addition, where an employer wishes to pay a greater level of top-up, in respect of employees with net pay of less than &euro;412 per week, in order to bring the employee&rsquo;s pay to &euro;350 per week, then tapering would not be applied to the subsidy.</p><p>These changes to the TWSS mean that more employees will now receive a subsidy of &euro;350 per week, and those with previous net pay below &euro;412 per week will now receive a greater level of subsidy. </p><p>These new rates have been fully operational for payroll submissions made on or after 4 May 2020, with a pay date on or after that same date.  </p><p>The changes announced allow the concentration of resources to protect incomes, in a proportionate way having regard to available resources, employer contribution and the broader suite of COVID-19 related supports put in place by the Government.</p><p>Currently, I have no plans to change the average wage calculation to a different period.</p></reply>

The underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed within a very short timeframe to support the urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the pandemic. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the  relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once that is possible. </p>  <p>  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE System and is based on each employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay. The average net weekly pay is calculated from the information contained in payroll submissions reported by the employer to Revenue for January and February 2020 pay dates. The core principles of the scheme, as set out in the legislation are that: </p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>  - the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020. </p>  <p>  Revenue recently amended the 15 March 2020 eligibility deadline for the February payroll submission to &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020 under its care and management provisions. This concession applies where all earlier returns were submitted before 15 March 2020.  These requirements are critical safeguards against abuse and exploitation of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the weekly payroll submissions for February 2020 in respect of the business in question were not received until 16 April 2020, which is outside of the revised &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020 deadline.  Revenue has further confirmed that the January 2020 payroll submissions were also not received until 16 April 2020 and that over the course of 2019, payroll submissions were generally not received within the required deadlines.  </p>  <p>  Revenue further advise me that it is for these reasons that the business cannot access the TWSS and that it is not possible for Revenue to design systems that will allow entry to the scheme where the inbuilt eligibility thresholds have not been adhered to. </p></reply>

It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself simply cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees. The core principles of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash; </p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p><p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020. </p><p>Accordingly, the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an employer has not met its statutory PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020, then the employer is not eligible to participate in the scheme. These requirements of the TWSS were critical safeguards against abuse and exploitation of the scheme. PAYE legislation requires employers to report their payroll to Revenue in real time as the payroll is run.  Thus, employers are obliged to report the tax and PRSI deducted from their employees&rsquo; wages in real time.  </p><p>Arising from the ongoing review of specific cases since the TWSS started, I am advised by Revenue that it became apparent  that a number of employers were unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and are otherwise tax compliant.  Given the purpose of the scheme to maintain the link between the employee and employer, Revenue decided, under its care and management provisions, to allow such employers access to the scheme, provided: </p><p>- the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, </p><p>- the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and  </p><p>- the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.</p><p>Having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, involving a significant interruption caused by a suspected COVID-19 outbreak, following further engagement between the business concerned and Revenue, and in recognition of the positive compliance record of the business concerned, I am advised by Revenue that it approved the business for the purposes of the operation of the TWSS. </p></reply>

At the outset you should note that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of vehicles.  </p>  <p>  I understand that in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, insurers use a combination of rating factors, such as the age of the driver, the age and type of vehicle, the relevant individual claims record and driving experience of the driver, the number of drivers, and how the car is used.  Insurers will price in accordance with their own overall past claims experience.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the scenario in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I understand that there may be circumstances where an insurer may ask for an additional engineer&rsquo;s certificate, for example if a vehicle has ever been modified or been repaired by an unofficial mechanic following an accident, etc..  While there may be a view that because a vehicle has a valid NCT certificate that such a report would not be necessary, it should be noted that insurers will generally require as a minimum that a car has a valid NCT in order to be covered. Accordingly, they will generally reserve the right to ask for additional information if they think it appropriate.  </p>  <p>  In summary, the requirements that insurers make of individual potential policyholders, and the prices they offer, differ across the market &ndash; which is why it is so important &ndash; as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website (www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/) recommends, to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Finally, as you may already be aware, Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, which can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.  </p></reply>

The TWSS, which was developed in a very short timeframe in response to the pandemic is designed around the dates specified in the legislation. The legal timelines are that employees were on the employer payroll at 29 February 2020 and that the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 15 March 2020. Revenue recently revised the eligibility conditions for the scheme under its care and management provisions, which extended the 15 March 2020 deadline to &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020.

The Act provides the Minister for Finance with powers to appoint a date for the Act to come into operation, or to appoint different days to commence different provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  At the end of January, I took the decision that the matter of when to commence the Act should be taken by the next Government. The background to this decision was a series of meetings with the major insurers where significant concerns were expressed about the early implementation of certain aspects of the Act.  Specifically, it was indicated to me that sufficient time would be needed in relation to the implementation of Sections 8 (Pre&ndash;contractual duties of consumer and insurer) and Section 12 (Renewal of contract of insurance).  In addition, Sections 9 (Proportionate remedies for misrepresentation) and 14 (Duties of consumer and insurer at renewal) are sufficiently interrelated with Section 8 that it is reasonable to consider that the concerns expressed also apply to these sections. Moreover, the Deputy should note that a general view was expressed by insurers that they also needed a number of months to prepare themselves for the implementation of the sections other than those referred to above.</p>  <p>  My officials have advised me that the sector has indicated to them that if insurers are not provided with sufficient time to implement the requirements necessary to fulfil the obligations of the above mentioned sections, they may be forced to withdraw certain products from the market in order to prioritise others so as to ensure that they are fully compliant with the law. Officials understand that such a development would most likely to impact the employer/public liability part of the market. While conscious of the sector&rsquo;s concerns, officials have emphasised to Insurance Ireland the importance of the need for ongoing preparation by the sector for the ultimate commencement of this Act, either on a phased basis or in full.</p>  <p>  Consequently, as I believe that this matter is one to be considered after the formation of the next Government, I cannot currently give any indication of a likely timeline for the commencement of this Act, on a phased basis or in full.</p></reply>

Urgent action needed to be taken to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions. All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector. The trustees of pension schemes affected by the levy had the option of adjusting current or prospective scheme benefits to take account of the levies, which included the possibility of reducing future retirement benefits.  </p>  <p>  For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. Under the legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It was up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p>  <p>  However, the legislation also included safeguards aimed at ensuring that, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it had to be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case could the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits. </p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies has been used to protect and create jobs and this helped to improve the financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will have since benefitted from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets.</p></reply>

Under the Act the Assessor is required to determine this value having regard to the following items:</p><p>- on the basis of the true financial state of Anglo Irish Bank on 15 January 2009, taking into account the underlying market values of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s assets and the extent of its actual, contingent and prospective liabilities on that date;</p><p>- having regard to the rights attaching to each class of transferred shares; and</p><p>- assuming that no financial assistance, investment or guarantee (other than the guarantee already provided under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008) would in future be provided to or made in Anglo Irish Bank, directly or indirectly, by the State.</p><p>The final report of the Anglo Irish Bank Assessor states that, in his opinion, absent the provision of recapitalisation funds from the Government that the former Anglo Irish Bank was unlikely to be able to continue to trade as it was &quot;both cashflow and balance sheet insolvent&quot;, as at 15 January 2009. </p><p>The Project Atlas October 2008 report, which PwC prepared, was based on Anglo&rsquo;s IFRS balance sheet as at 30 September 2008 which was after the Government bank guarantee.  The report stated that the balance sheet showed that the bank&rsquo;s assets exceeded its liabilities. </p><p>I am aware of the recent media article but note that the work conducted by the Assessor cannot be compared to the reports undertaken by PwC under Project Atlas given the different dates involved and the fact the Assessor's report was conducted on the assumption of no further future support being provided to the bank (in line with the requirements of the Act).</p><p>In relation to Promissory Note payments the Deputy will be aware that the Promissory Notes were cancelled consequent to the liquidation of IBRC in 2013 and that no payments have been made on those notes since that time.</p></reply>

While interest rates in Ireland remain higher than in many other European countries, there has been significant reduction in interest rates on new mortgage lending over the last 4-5 years. For example, the new business interest rate, excluding negotiations, on loans with fixations over one year, was 4.02% at Jan 2015 and is now 2.72%. These are significant reductions that benefit borrowers greatly over loan lifetimes. </p>  <p>  A number of important factors determine the interest rates charged on mortgages. These include the fact that the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks and capital requirements (which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience), operating costs, structural factors (for example the offering of cashback and other incentives in the Irish market) and weak competition in the domestic mortgage market. However, neither the Central Bank nor I have a statutory role to prescribe the lending, or indeed deposit, rates charged or paid by commercial banks or other commercial lenders.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has put in place a range of measures in order to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; for example, through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties. </p>  <p>  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, and became effective in February 2017, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. The new and enhanced requirements took effect from January 2019.</p></reply>

It builds on data returned to Revenue through the PAYE system and as such is a fully automated solution. The automated solution, which was developed in a very short timeframe in response to the pandemic, is designed around the dates specified in the legislation and cannot function where those timelines are not strictly adhered to. The timelines require that employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020 and that employers had fulfilled their PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 15 March 2020. </p>  <p>  The 15 March 2020 deadline in respect of the February payroll submission was recently extended to &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020 by Revenue under its care and management provisions. However, this concession can only apply where all previous payroll submissions were received by 15 March 2020. The concession, which was implemented on 24 April 2020, is also only applicable on a prospective basis and cannot be applied to previous pay periods.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question filed its February 2020 payroll submission on 20 March 2020 and as such was outside of the 15 March deadline as specified in the legislation. However, the business does qualify under the revised concessionary arrangements and has been receiving TWSS payments in respect of payrolls made on or after 24 April 2020.</p>  <p>  The business also received TWSS payments in error in respect of pay periods prior to 24 April to which it was not entitled. The error occurred due a combination of duplicate payroll submissions (by the business) and a technical issue with Revenue&rsquo;s IT system at that time. Revenue engaged directly with the business on the issue on 8 May 2020 and confirmed that the earlier payments were made in error and should be refunded.</p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that it will work with the business to agree a repayment arrangement that takes account of its current financial circumstances. </p></reply>

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately estimate the additional yield that would immediately arise from the recruitment of 180 audit staff.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also advised me that it undertakes a range of risk management interventions to target and confront different types of non-compliance in addition to tax evasion, for example, shadow economy and smuggling detection activity. The range of interventions used by Revenue has expanded in recent years to cover such diverse risks and includes, assurance checks, aspect queries, profile interviews, enforcement, investigations and prosecutions in addition to tax audits.</p>  <p>  The intervention deployed by Revenue in a case depends on the level of risk involved, and the average rate of return varies, depending on the scale of non-compliance. Also, in some types of interventions, for example enforcement, the focus is on the detection of drugs and fiscal smuggling where the direct exchequer yield is not the immediate objective. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I have always responded positively to any requests from Revenue for additional resources needed to tackle identified areas of tax or duty risk. For example, in each Budget since Budget 2016 I have introduced a series of &lsquo;compliance measures&rsquo; changes, which were aimed at raising tax revenue through enhanced taxpayer compliance and on each occasion, I have provided the necessary additional resources required by Revenue to ensure successful delivery. The analysis of the results of these compliance measures is available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/research/reviews/index.aspx, which may be of interest to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners noted that 92.7% of the value of imports from the UK in 2019 and 95.8% of the value of exports to the UK in 2019 was carried out by businesses who now have an EORI number.</p><p>In relation to businesses who trade with the UK, the Revenue Commissioners have analysed the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) returns and identified some 96,000 businesses that traded with the UK in 2019. Of these 96,000 businesses, approx. 57,000 do not currently have an EORI number. Of the larger businesses with annual UK import or export trade in excess of &euro;50,000, and therefore with a potential significant supply chain exposure to trade with the UK, the number without an EORI number is approximately 3,000. </p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have engaged closely with businesses during 2019 and this has continued in 2020. This engagement has contributed to the positive picture portrayed by this data. However, I am aware that many businesses have been and continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that social distancing requirements, while essential to prevent the spread of the virus, are unfortunately significantly impeding their ability to carry out many operational tasks. </p><p>Nonetheless and with this is mind, there are a range of actions that the Revenue Commissioners have encouraged and continue to encourage relevant businesses to consider, to ensure that businesses can trade with the UK after the transition period. This includes:</p><p>- Undertake supply chain and cash flow assessments so as to fully understand and identify the impact of Brexit,  </p><p>- Register for customs by getting an EORI number, if not already registered,</p><p>- Ensure they have the capability to lodge customs declarations, by either getting customs software or engaging a customs agent,</p><p>- Understand the impact of and make arrangements for paying import duties,</p><p>- Know the origin and commodity code(s) of the goods traded, </p><p>- Ensure compliance with product certification requirements,  </p><p>- Understand the obligations involved if trading in animal or plant products, and</p><p>- Consider what customs related simplifications or authorisations might be relevant and that would further ease the smooth and efficient flow of trade and goods at import or export.</p><p>I very much support this engagement by the Revenue Commissioners and I urge all businesses to take the necessary steps to ensure they can trade with the UK post the transition period. </p></reply>

The Irish economy is expected to contract by 10.5 per cent this year.</p>  <p>  Economic activity will gradually recover in the second half of the year, picking up momentum with growth of 6 per cent next year. In relation to Brexit, this is based on the assumption of a free-trade agreement being concluded between the EU and the UK at the end of the transition period in December this year.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the existing analysis in the joint research by the Department and the ESRI, published in March last year, broadly captures the range of possible future relationships between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  The analysis included a free trade agreement (of which there could be many forms), and a trading relationship under World Trade Organisation (WTO) frameworks. The impacts of these were modelled and estimated in the joint research.</p>  <p>  Under these scenarios, over the medium-term the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, respectively, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. However, the impacts would expected to be front-loaded.</p>  <p>  The negative impacts will be most severely felt in those sectors with strong export ties to the UK market &ndash; such as the agri-food, manufacturing and tourism sectors and also SMEs generally &ndash; along with their suppliers. The impact will be particularly noticeable outside the main cities.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the future relationship, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments alongside Budget 2021.</p></reply>

All eligible employees of qualifying employers are entitled to the wage subsidy.</p>  <p>  The TWSS is provided for in section 28 of the recently enacted Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 (The Act). Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself have been developed very quickly, having regard to the objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus.  </p>  <p>  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees. The core principles of the scheme are that</p>  <p>  -  the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p>  <p>  -  the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>  -  the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020, by 15 March 2020 (which date was recently extended to 31 March 2020 by Revenue concession and subject to conditions).</p>  <p>  The TWSS is predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picks up. The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020.</p>  <p>  There is no distinction made with regard to the subsidy amount, on the basis of whether the business has closed due to the restrictions brought in by the Government, or whether the business has continued to trade with employees continuing to work part-time or full time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

Such relief is permitted where the goods are imported by or on behalf of State bodies, public bodies and other bodies governed by public law, disaster relief agencies and organisations approved by Revenue including organisations regulated by the State and involved in the care, support and treatment of people at risk of COVID-19 and there is no scope to extend this to other sectors. The goods must be distributed or made available free of charge to the persons affected by or at risk from or involved in combating the COVID-19 outbreak by the bodies and organisations referred to above. The relief is scheduled to end on 31 July 2020 but there is provision for an extension if this is required following a review and consultation with Member States.</p>  <p>  Following a request from my Department, Revenue has also implemented, on an administrative basis, the application of the zero rate of VAT to the domestic supply of personal protection equipment including facemasks, ventilators, thermometers, hand sanitisers and oxygen as necessary to combat COVID-19 when supplied to hospitals, nursing homes, GP practices and the like, for use in the delivery of COVID-19 related health care services to their patients.  This concessionary treatment will apply until 31 July, subject to review.  The scope of the relief corresponds with the relief on the importation of these goods by the bodies specified in the Commission Decision.  </p>  <p>  The extension of zero rating to supplies of those specified medical supplies to dentists and shop owners and indeed other sectors and businesses would require a change in legislation to define the scope of, and provide a legal basis for, the desired zero rating. In addition it is important to stress that a business, such as a shop, which is registered for Irish VAT and incurs VAT in relation to goods which will be used for the purposes of a taxable business is entitled to reclaim the VAT incurred through their VAT return.</p></reply>

This set out an updated economic and fiscal scenario, for this year and next, incorporating the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The necessary fiscal cost of providing short-term support to the private sector will be significant. A general government deficit of &euro;23 billion was projected for this year.</p><p>The cost of these measures was estimated at &euro;6.8 billion, with the most important being the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. These are in place to support those who have lost their employment due to the restrictions and to help maintain the worker-employer relationship.</p><p>Following the introduction of further measures aimed at supporting enterprises my Department published a document in order to update the suite of measures detailed in the SPU. This document is available here: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/4d2b1f-covid-19-policy-response-overview-of-economic-support-measures/</i>. </p><p>The Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund, within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), will utilise up to &euro;2 billion of ISIF&rsquo;s readily available capital to invest in medium and large enterprises. This will not give rise to any additional Exchequer costs nor require any further borrowings to finance it.</p><p>The starting position is favourable: a general government surplus was delivered last year; the Rainy Day Fund (RDF) was established; at end-April the NTMA had c.&euro;20 billion of cash - pre-funding this year&rsquo;s redemptions; and there are no bonds maturing next year.</p><p>In light of the updated fiscal position, including the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement of &euro;15.6 billion, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has announced a revised bond funding range of &euro;20 billion to &euro;24 billion for the year.</p><p>The NTMA has issued &euro;12.5 billion in bonds so far this year. This includes two new bonds maturing in 2027 and 2035. There are further bond auctions scheduled this quarter. The NTMA also plans to increase Treasury Bill and Commercial Paper Issuance. Overall short term issuance is expected to increase by a further &euro;5 billion by year end.</p><p>The first instalment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) surplus of &euro;2 billion was due to be made this year and had already been accounted for in the Budget 2020 fiscal projections.</p><p>Given the scale of the impact on the economy of Covid-19 it is envisaged that the RDF drawdown, when it happens, will be for the current value of the Fund i.e. &euro;1.5 billion less expenses incurred by the NTMA in managing the Fund. Drawdown of the RDF means that the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for 2020 is c. &euro;1.5 billion less than would otherwise be the case.  The rationale for having such a Fund &ndash; for use in exceptional circumstances such as these &ndash; has been strengthened by this crisis.  </p><p>Due to recent successful debt issuances by the NTMA, there is no immediate need for drawdown and no specific date as to when drawdown will happen. Last month the NTMA successfully borrowed &euro;6 billion in the bond market for 7 years at less than &frac14; of 1 percent.</p><p>The interest rate environment remains accommodative owing to European Central Bank policy action and the introduction of its &euro;750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).</p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB), I have previously welcomed its monetary policy response to the pandemic, and particularly the PEPP and greater flexibility in its refinancing operations.  I expect banks to use the positive effects of these measures to support the economy and I know that the Central Bank of Ireland shares this view.  In terms of changes to ECB operations, I should point out that Article 130 of the Treaty for the European Union sets out that Government must respect the independence of the European Central Bank and not seek to influence its decisions.</p><p>Finally, I agreed with my fellow Euro&ndash;area finance Ministers the features and standardised terms of the European Stability mechanism (ESM) Pandemic Crisis Support instrument. This ESM instrument has been tailored to meet the challenges of this crisis and will provide a safety net of c.&euro;240 billion for Euro-area Member States.</p><p>I consider this instrument to be an important and credible safety net for the euro area, both in terms of its magnitude and availability to all euro area Member States, however, I do not envisage that Ireland will avail of this instrument for the reasons I have already set out.</p></reply>

In the case of the PUP, the taxation position will follow the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and, thus, while liable to income tax, the payments will be exempt from PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. This will be the case whether the recipient of the PUP is either a former PAYE worker or a person who was previously self-employed.</p>  <p>  While not liable to tax in real time under the PAYE system, the liability to tax on payments under the PUP scheme will instead normally be determined by way of review at the end of the tax year. I am advised by Revenue that when an end of the year review takes place, it may be the case that an employee&rsquo;s unused tax credits will cover any further liability that may arise as a result of taxation of PUP payments.  Where this is not the case and should a tax liability arise, it is normal Revenue practice to collect any tax owing in manageable amounts by reducing an individual&rsquo;s tax credits for a future year or future years in order to minimise any hardship.  Additionally, if an individual has any additional tax credits to claim, for example, health expenses, this will also reduce any tax that may be owing. I have been assured by Revenue that they will be adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting income tax due on payments made under the PUP scheme.</p></reply>

Their website also includes a car insurance shopping around checklist and other tips on cutting car insurance costs which may prove useful to consumers.</p></reply>

Revenue guidance provides that employers should not apply the non-statutory payroll deductions from net pay, unless the value of the additional gross pay (employer top-up) exceeds the value of the deductions, or that the employer is doing so with the agreement of the employee.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that non-statutory deductions from pay are matters that are agreed between the employee and employer concerned and do not form part of the payroll submission reported by employers to Revenue. Therefore, it will be a matter for the employer and the employee concerned to agree to have non-statutory deductions reapplied to the employee payroll after exiting the TWSS.</p></reply>

Importantly, it will not affect customers&rsquo; credit rating, nor increase the burden on non-performing loans on the banks.</p><p>The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers&rsquo; best interests and it has communicated its expectations to the BPFI that at the end of the agreed payment break, borrowers should be given the option to either:</p><p>i.  repay the loan within the remaining term or </p><p>ii. extend the term of the loan. </p><p>This choice should apply for all loans and the impact of both options on the overall cost of credit and monthly repayments should be fully explained to the customer, noting that borrower circumstances and the appropriateness of each option will differ.</p><p>As part of their supervisory work, the Central Bank will monitor compliance with this expectation and take action, where their expectations are not met.</p></reply>

While the fiscal and economic circumstances have changed dramatically, the magnitude of the projected &lsquo;fiscal swing&rsquo; forecast under such a scenario may be indicative of the potential impact of the transition period ending without a trade arrangement. </p>  <p>  In nominal terms, the Budget 2020 forecast for 2020 projected a general government deficit of some &euro;2.0 billion, compared to the SPU forecast (previous April) of a general government surplus of &euro;1.2 billion. At the time, this negative 'swing' was broadly indicative of the fiscal cost of a disorderly Brexit. </p>  <p>  These projections were point in time forecasts published in October of last year. Since then, the fiscal and economic situation has evolved significantly, including, but not limited to, the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  At best, October's forecast can be seen as an indication of the scale of the economic and fiscal impact of the transition period ending without a trade deal. An updated estimate - taking into account the present circumstances - may differ significantly from these historic figures.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published Stability Programme Update, the combined effect of the Covid shock with a disorderly UK exit would have severe implications for the economy and, accordingly, for the public finances. </p>  <p>  Trade negotiations between the EU and UK are ongoing and the outcome is highly uncertain. The full set of economic and fiscal forecasts will be updated by my Department as part of the Budget 2021 process. </p></reply>

No. 510 of 2018).</p>  <p>  The USC was introduced in Budget 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and it is applied at a low rate on a wide base. Taxation revenue from all taxes, including the Universal Social Charge, goes towards funding essential public services and the provision of these services would be negatively impacted if there was a fall in the income received from such taxation. </p>  <p>  As a result of changes in recent Budgets, USC rates have been reduced to 0.5%, 2% and 4.5%.  The income level at which taxpayers begin to pay the higher rate of tax has also been increased by &euro;2,500 and there have been increases in both the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit.  The impact of these changes is that the top marginal rate on incomes up to &euro;70,000 has been reduced from 52% to 48.5%, with fewer people on incomes around the national average having any income subject to the 40% rate of income tax. </p>  <p>  It is not my intention to exempt this charge for apprentices. It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the EU and OECD. This means that Ireland&rsquo;s tax system is designed to ensure that those on lower incomes pay less tax than those who earn more.  </p></reply>

In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. </p>  <p>  Within the parameters of the regulatory framework, it is a matter for regulated entities to manage their own processes for the various mortgage application, consideration, approval and granting stages, including in respect of validity periods for mortgage &ldquo;Approval in Principle&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application. The BPFI&rsquo;s FAQ advises that lenders may extend the period of a mortgage &ldquo;Approval in Principle&rdquo; where an individual&rsquo;s circumstances have not materially changed as a result of COVID-19. This will likely be for 3-6 months, but it may vary depending on the lender&rsquo;s assessment of an individual&rsquo;s circumstances. However, if their circumstances have materially changed as a result of Covid-19, lenders may keep the application open on its system for a period of time; but this again may vary depending on the lender&rsquo;s assessment of an individual&rsquo;s circumstances. After this period of time, the lender will undertake a review of the application which will likely include a request for the individual to provide an update on their employment and income situation.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once that is possible. Eligibility for the scheme can be satisfied by an employer once they meet the relevant criteria. </p>  <p>  The TWSS scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector. This includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce.  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020. There is no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business has closed for any defined period due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or has continued to trade with employees continuing to work full time or part time, with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income, reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the TWSS. There is, however, no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but, for Revenue operational systems reasons, the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll.  If the employer makes an additional payment greater than the difference allowed by the scheme, then the subsidy value refundable to the employer will be reduced by this excess amount when the refund reconciliation is performed by Revenue in due course. </p>  <p>  Revenue published detailed guidance on employer eligibility and supporting proofs for the TWSS and it is available on the Revenue website:</p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/documents/guidance-on-employer-eligibility-and-supporting-proofs.pdf.</p></reply>

I welcomed the ongoing work of the credit union sector to support members in difficulties due to COVID-19 and acknowledged the health and safety risk front line staff are facing every day to ensure continuity of services to members. I noted the vital work the credit union sector is carrying out, which builds on the government&rsquo;s call for solidarity and community spirit which is synonymous with credit unions. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my officials have had weekly calls with the credit union representative bodies and weekly engagement sessions with the Registry of Credit Unions in the Central Bank to review any emerging issues in the sector resulting from the pandemic, and to ensure smooth information flow between the sector and Government. The Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) is also meeting weekly.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the key role that credit unions play in the delivery of financial services in local communities across Ireland, the need for which is heightened at this time. Credit unions account for about 4 per cent of lending to households and non-financial corporations from banks and credit unions and represent approximately one third of the consumer credit market. Credit unions are well positioned to provide access to credit to support the recovery from the current crisis.  </p>  <p>  The economic outlook arising by virtue of COVID-19 presents an unwelcome challenge to the sector, particularly the reduced demand for new lending. As a result it was agreed that the CUAC would report to me by 30 June on challenges and opportunities for the sector, incorporating implications of COVID-19, the role credit unions could play in the economic recovery and any relevant recommendations.</p></reply>

It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself simply cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees. The core principles of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash; </p><p>-  the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>-  the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and</p><p>-  the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020. </p><p>Accordingly, the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an employer has not met its statutory PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020, then the employer is not eligible to participate in the scheme.  These requirements of the TWSS were critical safeguards against abuse and exploitation of the scheme. PAYE legislation requires employers to report their payroll to Revenue in real time as the payroll is run.  </p><p>Arising from the ongoing review of specific cases since the TWSS started, it became apparent to Revenue that a number of employers were unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and are otherwise tax compliant.  Given the purpose of the scheme to maintain the link between the employee and employer, Revenue decided, under its care and management provisions, to allow such employers access to the scheme, provided: </p><p>-  the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, </p><p>-  the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and  </p><p>-  the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.</p><p>Having regard to any particular extenuating circumstances that may apply in a specific case, I am advised by Revenue that, having regard to the overall criteria as set out in my reply, Revenue is happy to engage with a business as to how those extenuating circumstances may be able to be addressed for the purposes of the TWSS. </p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the cycle to work scheme, introduced by the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008, is to encourage more employees to cycle to and from work, or between work places, thereby contributing to lowering carbon emissions, reducing traffic congestion and improving health and fitness levels.</p>  <p>  The legislation only allows for one purchase of a bicycle in respect of an employee in a five-year period irrespective of whether the bicycle was used for the full period or not. It operates on a self-assessment basis using straightforward rules. Any deviation from the current system would involve additional administrative procedures for either or both Revenue and employers in relation to the verification of loss, theft, insurance recovery, etc. As this runs counter to the administrative simplicity of the existing provisions, it would not be appropriate to alter the existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Anyone obtaining a bicycle under the scheme would therefore be advised to ensure it is covered by insurance.</p>  <p>  It is not clear what the Deputy intends as a similar scheme for those in receipt of social welfare payments. Benefit-in-kind is a charge to tax that applies where an employer provides an employee with a benefit such as a bicycle, car or accommodation. As such, an individual in receipt of social welfare payments is not in employment and therefore cannot qualify for the scheme.</p></reply>

Where it is not possible to perform one&rsquo;s role at home and the employee is required to attend a workplace as an essential worker, they should follow the HSE guidelines on social distancing to minimise risk of transmission. There are other flexible working options that employers can offer to employees in addition to home working arrangements e.g. staggered hours, wider opening hours. These measures can help facilitate segregation of the workforce and social distancing as well as support employees in managing caring responsibilities at home. </p>  <p>  As per the Government announcements throughout March and April, everyone was required to stay at home in all circumstances until 18 May 2020, unless they met certain criteria, one of which is for the purposes of work for an essential service that cannot be done from home. Only essential workers who could not work from home were present in the physical workplace, and this remains the case until the easing of restrictions is implemented via the five phases of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. One of the principles in all five stages of the roadmap is that remote working is to continue for those who can do so and the civil and public service will be following this principle. </p></reply>

In particular, as outlined in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) the significant portion of the additional voted expenditure arising from the Covid-19 measures is across the Health and Employment Affairs and Social Protection Vote Groups. Further detail on the expenditure trends for these Departments is set out below.  </p><p>In the area of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, there are a number of key measures. These include the Covid-19 Illness Benefit, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). As outlined in the SPU, the estimated cost of these measures over a 12 week period is in the range of &euro;4 billion to &euro;4&frac12; billion, with the introduction of the PUP and the TWSS reducing the level of expenditure on the Sick Pay and Illness Benefit Scheme over this period. In addition, as outlined in the SPU there will also be higher expenditure on income supports over the rest of 2020, reflecting the unemployment forecasts at that time. </p><p>The expenditure figures published with the March Exchequer Returns reflected expenditure in respect of the PUP and TWSS of over &euro;0.1 billion, with the cumulative amount included in the April expenditure figures being over &euro;1&frac12; billion.</p><p>It is expected that 585,000 people will receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment during the week commencing 18th May 2020, at a cost of just over &euro;0.2 billion.

The OPW and Cork County Council are continuing to engage proactively and a further meeting is expected for June 2020 to discuss details to bring this scheme forward to Public Exhibition.</p>  <p>  My Office has engaged engineering consultants to finalise scheme drawings for the preferred option, and extensive face-to-face consultation has taken place between OPW engineers, member of the public and local stakeholders, with draft exhibition drawings and schedules currently being prepared. </p>  <p>  Environmental surveys have been completed, with a view to completing the Environmental Impact Assessment shortly. The OPW is aware of the &lsquo;high&rsquo; water quality status of the respective water body in the area around Ballyvourney and Ballymakeera. The Project Team is currently assessing the potential impact of any proposed flood relief measures in that respect, and engaging with the Project&rsquo;s Environmental Consultants in order to ensure that suitable mitigation requirements are implemented, and appropriate processes to comply with statutory provisions are followed. This is obviously an important consideration, and resolving some outstanding issues is taking longer than had previously been envisaged. Nonetheless, it is hoped that the scheme can progress to Public Exhibition within the coming months.</p>  <p>  When these stages are successfully completed and, provided the proposals are broadly accepted at Public Exhibition by the public and the stakeholders, the scheme will proceed to detailed design stage and formal Confirmation by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, following which construction can commence. </p>  <p>  My Office continues to liaise with Cork County Council and local representatives and are very committed to progressing this Scheme.</p>  <p>  In the interim, Cork County Council has been approved funding under the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme; this includes approval of &euro;10,000 in February 2012 for the removal of overhanging growth and other obstacles to the Sullane River 3.4 miles from Ballvourney bridge and an additional &euro;187,248 approved in October 2018 for the provision of temporary flood defence measures.</p></reply>

Members of any Tender Evaluation Team set up in respect of a procurement are required to evaluate all tenders in a fair and unbiased fashion and in strict compliance with the evaluation methodology and the qualification and award criteria set out in the relevant tender documents and must sign the Department&rsquo;s Declaration Regarding Conflict of Interest and Confidentiality Undertaking before tender evaluation commences. In relation to the ongoing management of consultancy contracts, the obligations to disclose interests and the prohibitions on performing official functions imposed under the Ethics in Public Office Acts apply to all staff within the Department at Administrative Officer / Higher Executive Officer level and above.  </p><p>I understand that the position in respect of other Departments will be provided by the relevant Ministers in separate replies.</p></reply>

The <i>In This Together</i>campaign draws together the huge range of advice and support that is available for people of all ages. To support the wellbeing and mental health of our Leaving Certificate students at this time, a dedicated page on the <i>In This Together</i>site contains online advice for Leaving Certificate students.  This webpage includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, stress and anxiety, developed by NEPS. The webpage also includes links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and the Department has worked with the Department of Health and HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for those students. A planning group has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, and the NGO sector, in recognition of the fact that prior to, during and following national emergencies there is a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs. </p><p>The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  These services augment the work of NEPS and assist students who may be feeling anxious at this time. In addition, additional support services have been identified for the general population that can assist students and their families at this time. </p><p>During this challenging time the school building may be closed but schools have structures in place to support students. It has often been the case, that the first port of call for Leaving Certificate students who are experiencing distress has been their school. Schools have developed excellent and flexible systems of support. Many schools have a designated Student Support Team, while other schools have equivalent systems and structures, but may use different terminology to describe their arrangements, such as &lsquo;Care Team&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pastoral Care Team&rsquo;. Either way, the structures schools have in place will continue to have a key role identifying issues and students for discussion by the Student Support Team with appropriate action/ follow-up. In these uncertain times, the familiarity of these school structures and personnel will offer continuity and reassurance to students. A guidance document for Post-Primary Schools on supporting the wellbeing of students and the role of Student Support Teams has been published by my Department.</p><p>NEPS psychologists continue to be available to provide advice and support to school principals, teachers and school communities. NEPS provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for students with identified difficulties and in signposting to more specialist support, when needed, including onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.  </p><p>NEPS is proactively exploring a number of innovative ways to continue to provide educational psychological services to school communities at this time.</p></reply>

The Guidelines for schools on implementing the special education teacher allocation model advises schools as to the importance of ensuring that student support plans or educational plans are in place.</p><p>My Department has issued a range of guidance for schools on how to provide for continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. Additional guidance has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs.</p><p>This guidance is available at:</p><p><i></i><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teachers knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>Schools should review the pupil&rsquo;s support plans to identify aspects of the programme that can be worked on in the home environment and are advised that planning should be pupil focused and aligned with the learning targets as set out in the support file for the pupil.</p><p>The school leadership team will have a key role in monitoring and affirming the whole-school effort to ensure consistency and promote sharing of practice. This team, comprising the principal and those with assigned management or coordination duties are advised to encourage and supporting teachers as they develop their practices towards distance learning for pupils with SEN.</p></reply>

The funding is to assist schools to support students at risk of educational disadvantage due to school closures. Schools have been asked to use this funding to address situations where students are disadvantaged in their engagement with the schools remote teaching and learning due to lack of access to digital devices.</p><p>This ICT Grant funding issues to schools, as schools are best placed to identify the requirements of their own student cohort and to meet those requirements. Decisions as to what equipment is to be acquired and procurement of same is the responsibility of schools. While students, pupils and teachers can engage with remote learning using devices including Desktop PCs, Tablets and Chromebooks for example, for those schools who have determined that laptops are required and in order to ameliorate current laptop supply situation for schools, the Department has advised schools of two mechanisms to aggregate purchase orders from schools for laptops under centralised bulk provisioning processes. The generation of a bulk order will enable prioritisation of laptops orders with manufacturers, and so expedite delivery over and above timelines that are generally available at present. These mechanisms are Single Provider Frameworks for the provision of Dell and HP laptops respectively, established based on OGP Frameworks, and meet technical and procurement requirements for schools.

The Group contains representatives of students, parents, teachers, school management bodies as well as the Department and its agencies.</p>  <p>  Every effort was made to run the 2020 Leaving Certificate as close as possible to the way the examinations were originally intended to be held. However, based on public health advice and other assessments, I concluded that the Leaving Certificate examinations could not be held in a reliable and valid manner, nor in a way that would be equitable for students, In July and August.</p>  <p>  Many different scenarios were considered by the Group, such as online exams, shortened papers, and fewer examinations. None of these options would have been as fair an assessment as the Calculated Grades model. They would also have been markedly different from previous Leaving Certificate examinations and from what students and their teachers are familiar with and have been preparing for in terms of structure, format and content, over the past two years. Changes like those would have called into question the validity of the state examinations this year.</p>  <p>  The notes of the meetings of the advisory group are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and are published once approved by the group at subsequent meetings.</p></reply>

A core objective of the contingency plans will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p><p>The issues are also being considered by the Primary Education Forum which includes all stakeholders in the sector and it will also be addressed by the Advisory Group which involves representatives of stakeholders from the post-primary sector.</p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period.</p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at </p><p>In addition to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment.</p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure.</p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who </p><p>teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at </p><p>Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at</p><p><i></i></p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at:</p><p>I also recently announced that a special &euro;10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby &euro;40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. &euro;10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p></reply>

These calculated grades will form the basis of admission to further and higher education in the same way that Leaving Certificate grades are used.</p>  <p>  Students&rsquo; calculated grades will be transferred directly to the CAO, in the same way that examination results usually are. The CAO timelines will run as close as possible to normal to allow for students to take up offers and to transition to tertiary education. </p>  <p>  Students will also have the option to sit the Leaving Certificate exams at a later stage in the year. Those who receive an improved CAO offer on foot of these results will receive a deferred offer to start their course in the 2021/2022 academic year. If a candidate who has started the first year of a course becomes entitled to a higher CAO offer and chooses to accept it, attendance for the first year on the new course would remain eligible for free fees and SUSI funding as appropriate.</p></reply>

The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school.</p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule each year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy received an additional allocation for the 2019/20 school year to take account of the fact that the school had increased enrolments.</p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>This school referred to in this question also made an application to the NCSE for a review of the schools allocation of special education teachers on the grounds of exceptional circumstances arising in the school.</p><p>The NCSE has completed the review of the school and has now made an additional allocation to the school.</p><p>This school currently has an allocation of 132 Special Education Teaching hours. This allocation equates to 6 full time Special Education Teaching posts in the school, which is in addition to the mainstream staffing allocation.</p><p>This is a very significant allocation for a school enrolment of 262 pupils (2019/20 school year) and includes the additional allocations which were made for developing enrolments and an for exceptional needs which was made following a review of the school.</p><p>The provision of 6 special education teachers creates a relativity of 1 special education teacher for every 43 pupils in the school, which is far greater than the national average allocation for schools.</p><p>Should the school enrolments continue to grow for September 2020, to the extent that the school achieves one or more developing mainstream posts, then a process is in place to further increase the special education teaching allocation for the school automatically and without recourse to a further exceptional needs review.</p><p>The allocations for all schools are also due to be updated in Spring 2021, for the 2021/22 school year based on updated school profile data.</p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>This Government is investing heavily in supporting our children with special educational needs, with &euro;1.8bn being spent annually, about &euro;1 in every 5 of the education budget.</p><p>There are currently over 13,500 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>There are therefore more special education teachers in schools now than we have ever had previously. </p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p><p>In relation to the establishment of special class places in the Cork area, the NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>The NCSE's Local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs in relation to special class provision.</p><p>Schools who wish to open special classes should make an application to the NCSE to open such special classes. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school. </p><p>As the school referred to in this question is currently in temporary accommodation, a development plan for the school for future years will be required to address this issue. The school should therefore continue to engage with the NCSE in relation to this matter, and in the context of its capacity for ongoing development ,as the NSCE is currently considering the additional special class placements which will be required for the 2020/21 school year.</p></reply>

This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular andexisting SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school.

This review, undertaken by an expert independent international consortium, commenced in Q4 2019 and is scheduled to be substantially complete in Q4 2020. </p>  <p>  The comprehensive and detailed analysis of funding options for higher education and the assessment of the appropriate balance between provision across the tertiary education system is expected to play a very important role in informing Government decision-making in this critical area.  It will provide the basis for a national consensus on the appropriate policy approach which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability and progress and the delivery of key policy objectives under Project Ireland 2040 and Future Jobs Ireland.</p></reply>

This guidance has issued to schools to support the continuity of teaching and learning, to support those with special educational needs, to support those at risk of educational disadvantage and to support the wellbeing of students. Further guidance is being developed to support students at each of the key stages of transitions.</p>  <p>  This guidance has been developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders &ndash; including teachers, parents and learners. There is also ongoing consultation with the management bodies and unions from both sectors on all matters relating to Covid 19, which will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  Schools have adopted various ways to engage with their students and these will vary in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at the home. Schools are engaging with students and parents using various means such as by post, e-mails, communication apps or the school website. Where technology permits, students may have regular engagement with their teacher/s on platforms such as Google Classroom, Microsoft Office 365 and Edmodo or participate in live meetings through the use of tools such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Webex.  Schools have been asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continue to have the opportunity to participate in learning. The aim of these distant learning approaches is to ensure that children stay connected with learning to facilitate progression to the next level of their education.</p>  <p>  A group has also been established within my Department to look at the reopening of schools in the Autumn. This involves two strands: </p>  <p>  - the logistics of reopening; health and safety; hygiene; social distancing, etc. and</p>  <p>  - curriculum considerations, i.e. what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures.</p>  <p>  - The development of guidance on reopening of schools will be informed by this group and by learning from other jurisdictions who are further down the road of reopening their society, including their school systems. </p>  <p>  - My department is continuing to review and monitor the situation in accordance with the advice from public health authorities.</p></reply>

In recognition that some final year students engaged in programmes of initial teacher education may not have fully completed their school placement by the time these closures were enforced, the Teaching Council released the following statement: </p>  <p>  Final year students who qualify in 2020 and have yet to fully complete their final school placement will not be adversely affected when it comes to applying for registration as a result of the closure of schools. This means that teachers who have been awarded their qualification will not be disadvantaged due their inability to complete school placement as a result of closure of schools. </p>  <p>  Therefore, applications for registration by final year student teachers graduating in 2020 will still be processed and no additional conditions will be applied.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the statement specifically references that it is applicable to teachers who have been awarded their qualification. It is the Higher Education Institutions that award academic qualifications, which undoubtedly gives assurance to the public in relation to the full competence of the 2020 graduating classes from programmes of initial teacher education.</p>  <p>  The full school placement requirement remains in place for all student teachers who are not in the final year of their initial teacher education programme.</p></reply>

Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs.</p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased almost threefold, from 548 to 1,618 for the 2019/2020 school year; with 1,353 of these catering for children with autism.</p><p>There are currently 195 special classes and 13 special schools in the Cork area providing specialist support to children with more complex special educational needs. </p><p>A list of special classes and special schools for the current school year is available on the NCSE website. </p><p>Budget 2020 provided for an additional 265 special class teachers in 2020, which will allow for the opening of additional classes where required.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally, including Cork, to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places. I know this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.  </p><p>As Minister, I have power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. This legislation has been used to good effect in the recent past.</p><p>The NCSE has recently advised that there is a shortage of a small number of special class places in certain areas in Co Cork, largely due to geographic reasons rather than a shortage in the county as a whole. The NCSE is seeking to accommodate these students in schools in the surrounding areas, where possible and they are continuing to work as a matter of urgency in accommodating students who require such placements.  </p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs.  Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: </p></reply>

The examinations will be run at a future date when it is safe and practicable to do so.

A working group on mitigating educational disadvantage is supporting on-going responses to what is an evolving situation, to ensure the continuation of crucial funding sources such as SUSI grants, the 1916 Bursary Scheme, the Student Assistant Fund, Fund for Students with a disability and other allowances. All stakeholders in this group have worked to support learners without access to sufficient technology and to ensure the continuation of services offered by access and disability offices, guidance counsellors and counselling services. </p><p>My Department is conscious of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.</p><p><b>Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: </b></p><p><b>SUSI</b></p><p>- Student grant payments for academic year 2019/20 will continue as normal. The duration and value of the grant will not change. </p><p>- Student grant applications for academic year 2020/21 will be assessed based on income earned in 2019. </p><p>- If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant.</p><p>- The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p><p>- The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).</p><p><b>Student Assistance Fund</b></p><p>- The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1m added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.  Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In December 2018 a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This funding continued into 2019 and 2020.</p><p>-  Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>- The funding allocation for the student grant scheme and the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) is determined in the context of the overall estimates and budgetary process undertaken by all Government Departments.  However, all proposals made in relation to education expenditure will be considered in the context of Budget 2021, having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</p><p><b>PATH Bursaries</b></p><p>- Funding under the strand 1 of the Programme for  Access to Higher Education (PATH) which supports access to initial teacher training by Nation </p><p>- all Access Plan target groups, set up in 2016 on a pilot basis for three years will be continued for a further three years. This will ensure that initiatives supported under this fund will continue despite disruptions in education brought about by Covid-19. </p><p>- Finally,  tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

Three of these classes are new classes, opened in September 2019.</p>  <p>  Of the 124 special schools nationally, there are two special schools for the deaf. </p>  <p>  The NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service includes Visiting Teachers, who are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.</p>  <p>  Each visiting teacher (VT) is responsible for a particular region and is allocated a caseload of students. The VT supports children/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child. </p>  <p>  The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs. The work of the VT involves liaising with other professionals and agencies such as audiological scientists, ophthalmology services, speech and language therapists, low vision specialists, psychologists, early intervention teams, school staffs, and with parents.</p>  <p>  Included in the brief of the Support Service is to enhance the quality of learning and teaching of students with special educational needs through the provision of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and support for teachers. </p>  <p>  The NCSE provide direct support to schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible, offering telephone advice, a school visit from a member of the team, an in-service course for individual teachers, or whole-school training. Whole-school training will ensure that all teachers are equipped to cater for the pupils&rsquo; educational needs, as they progress through primary and post primary school.</p>  <p>  Among the courses towards which funding is provided to schools are courses in Irish Sign Language, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers. </p>  <p>  Additional supports provided by my Department include funding to schools for assistive technology such as radio aids and Soundfield systems, special transport arrangements for pupils, and enhanced levels of capitation in special classes and special schools. </p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.  My Department grants the funding to parents in order that they can pay the tutors directly.</p>  <p>  Reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs, inlcuidng students who are deaf/hard of hearing, to participate in state exams. </p>  <p>  The NCSE published Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, including recommendations relating to ISL provision.  </p>  <p>  Separately, the Comprehensive review of the SNA Scheme made a number of recommendations relating to students who are deaf or hard of hearing. Relating specifically to students who are deaf, the NCSE recommends Irish Sign Language qualified assistants in schools, to support profoundly deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this provision should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of this review and the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, a scheme will be developed to provide Irish Sign Language support for students attending recognised schools, whose primary language is Irish Sign Language.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities supports students at third level to participate fully in their academic programmes and aims to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by reason of a disability.</p>  <p>  A new undergraduate programme in Dublin City University (DCU), launched in 2019, enables deaf and hard of hearing people who use Irish Sign Language (ISL) to enter primary teaching.</p>  <p>  Specialised Training for people with disabilities is funded by the National Training Fund, which targets unemployed people with disabilities.</p></reply>

Calculated grades are the best way of getting an accurate estimation of what a student would have achieved across all components of their examination. </p>  <p>  Teachers are best placed to make a balanced judgement about what the candidate&rsquo;s overall performance and grade across all aspects of the subject including orals would have been. This means the calculated grade will be as close to the outcome of the traditional Leaving Certificate as possible and comparable to the Leaving Certificate grades any other year. </p>  <p>  Teachers of languages will assess the student&rsquo;s oral performance as well as their written skills to come to an estimated mark for each student. It was never intended to offer 100% for all practical or project work.

The calculated grades system will combine estimates of a student&rsquo;s expected performance in a subject and level, with information about how students in the school have fared in this subject in recent years in line with national performance standards over  time.  The National standardisation process does not favour any type of student or school.</p>  <p>  When the estimated marks from a school are standardised, if a candidate is a particularly strong candidate in a class &ndash; irrespective of the school attended &ndash; then that student will still emerge as a particularly strong candidate, and the calculated grade will be as close to what would have achieved in the examinations as it is possible to calculate.</p>  <p>  Whether or not the marks in any subject from a school move up or down during National standardisation depends on the accuracy with which teachers and schools have made their estimates, not on the kind of school a student is attending. For example, it is possible that the estimated marks in one subject from a school will need to be moved up and the marks in another subject from the same school will need to be moved down.</p>  <p>  The most important information about each student is the marks and ranking that the school provides to the Department. National standardisation uses two further sources of information to adjust a school&rsquo;s estimated marks if there is evidence that a school has been too harsh or too lenient in a given subject. The way these two sources of information are used is interconnected.</p>  <p>  The first of the two further sources of information for the National standardisation process is the Junior Cycle/Certificate actual marks attained by the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 taking a particular subject in the given school, and the second is about the general pattern of results in the subject from Leaving Certificate classes in that school over a number of years.</p>  <p>  This information will all be assembled and will be used to predict the level of achievement that this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate group would have been expected to reach in that subject if they had sat the Leaving Certificate examination in the normal way. This means that if a given class is a particularly &ldquo;strong class&rdquo;, the expected level of achievement of that class would reflect that fact and so the National standardisation process will take full account of it. If the school&rsquo;s estimated marks reflect this properly, then there will not be a need to move them up or down.</p>  <p>  Research and statistics allow my Department to understand the extent to which groups of students in a school have results that are similar from one year to the next. These sources also allow my Department to take account of the fact that individuals within those groups can have levels of achievement that can vary quite a lot.</p>  <p>  The information about each individual and their peers is combined with the information about the school&rsquo;s previous results and previous groups to allow checks that the marks and rankings for each subject in a school and all other schools are reasonable. This means that all candidates across the country are treated fairly.</p>  <p>  Most importantly, I can confirm that the statistical process being applied will not impose any predetermined score on any individual in a class or school.  </p></reply>

This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards established by QQI reflect the accreditation criteria that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. Engagement is ongoing between members of the stakeholders group, QQI and CORU to ensure that necessary arrangements are put in place to maintain standards of education and training in this area so that students can progress e.g. from third year into fourth year or, where relevant, graduate with the relevant professional competencies that have been set out by CORU and which are reflected in QQI&rsquo;s award standards.    </p></reply>

As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. </p><p>Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes. </p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p><p>The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020/21.  </p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.</p><p>On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.</p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.</p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open addtional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an addtional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.</p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.</p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.</p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.</p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.</p></reply>

This decision was made following the assessment of public health advice, and was made in the best interests of students and all those involved in running the state exams.</p>  <p>  The system whereby calculated grades are generated includes a process of national standardisation in which marks and rankings submitted by schools will be examined and may be adjusted using statistical methods to ensure a common national standard is applied. Profiles of achievement at Leaving Certificate level over the last three years will be used as part of this process and this will help ensure that the grades issued remain in line with national performance standards over time.</p>  <p>  However CAO points naturally fluctuate from year to year because of the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirement, the performance of applicants, and the number of places on offer.  It is not possible to predict whether points will go up or down in any year, due to these variable elements.</p></reply>

The report made 14 specific recommendations across 4 key areas:</p><p>- Reform of the future direction of the NTF.</p><p>- Utilising the NTF to support investment in Higher Education.</p><p>- Enhancing enterprise engagement and input to NTF priorities.</p><p>- Improvements in monitoring/evaluation of the NTF</p><p>An Implementation Plan to deliver these recommendations was published alongside the announcement of Budget 2019 along with details of a new NTF advisory group. This advisory group is a permanent resourced structure to optimise enterprise engagement on NTF priorities. The membership of the group consists of key stakeholders from the enterprise sector, Department officials, and bodies who have a strategic and oversight role in delivery of skills provision. The Group has met on three occasions in 2019 and have informed the priorities and direction of funding from the NTF for Budget 2020.  </p><p>In recent years, there has been a need to change and rebalance the suite of funded programmes to reflect the changing labour market conditions and areas of skills needs. Programmes are now more focused on labour market skill needs across higher education, further education and training and other partners. The NTF Advisory Group has been considering the implications for the Fund in light of the transformed economic and labour market landscape arising from COVID-19 and have fed into the overall skills policy as part of the immediate response to the current crisis and also the future world of work. </p><p><b>Amount Collected from the NTF Levy 2018 &ndash; April 2020</b></p><p>The NTF levy is collected by the Revenue Commissioners as part of the PRSI collection system. The funds collected is included in the transfer of gross PRSI from the Revenue Commissioners to the Social Insurance Fund of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP). Each year DEASP undertakes an apportionment exercise to analyse PRSI collection data and to apportion funds to the Social Insurance Fund; the Health Levy and the National Training Fund.</p><p>At the end of April 2020, the National Training Fund had received &euro;261m in respect of NTF levy receipts.  This would represent the contributions from employers in respect of the four months from December 2019 to March 2020. The following table shows the income generated by the levy from 2018 to 2020. In the 2020 Revised Estimates for the Public Service, the levy is profiled to collect &euro;823m, although this estimate was made before the current COVID-19 crisis. NTF income is now likely to be significantly reduced given the economic impact of COVID-19. Early estimates project that the reduction in income will be over 20%.  <table>    <tr>       <th>NTF Levy </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;000</td>       <td>&euro;000</td>       <td>&euro;000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>553,756</td>       <td>712,000</td>       <td>823,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I also include tables which outline the additional information requested by the Deputy:</p><p>Table 1: NTF provision funding by types of course of programme</p><p>Table 2: Breakdown of participation by NTF programme </p><p>Table 3: The percentage breakdown of the funding between training for those in employment and those unemployed</p><p>Table 4:The number of participants under the programme annually by NTF Programme</p><p>Additional information on the programmes supported by the Fund can be found at the following link:</p><p>  </p><p>  ">National Training Fund</p></reply>

This decision was taken by Cabinet based on public health advice as the welfare of students and that of their families is front and central to all decision making.</p><p>Leaving Certificate candidates can now opt to have calculated grades issued to them in order to facilitate their progress to third-level education in 2020. The plan is to provide calculated grades to candidates as close as possible to the normal results day.</p><p>All candidates will also have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate Examination at the earliest, safest and practical time to do so. The State Examinations Commission will set about putting the detailed arrangements for these examinations in place, guided of course by health advice.</p><p>I am aware that there are candidates who are repeating a Leaving Certificate subject/s in order to satisfy a minimum entry requirement for entry to a 3<sup>rd</sup>level programme of initial teacher education. For those candidates who are studying one or more subjects outside of a recognised school, my Department will be flexible in accepting estimated marks and rankings from other schools or colleges, and will look at this issue on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>In general, I can say that, provided that my Department can receive an estimated mark and ranking from a teacher in a way that is fair to all candidates, my Department will seek to provide a calculated grade. This calculated grade can then be used in the same way as a Leaving Certificate grade to satisfy minimum entry requirements for entry to an initial teacher education programme. My Department will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

Additionally a group chaired by the Department of Education and Skills has also been established with the key stakeholders to examine the impact of and plan responses to the projected impact of Covid19 on international students numbers.</p>  <p>  The projected financial impact of Covid19 on Higher Education and the Tertiary Education system as a whole is being assessed by the Department of Education and Skills as part of its ongoing analysis of the impact of Covid19 on the education sector overall.  The provision of additional financial support to support Tertiary Education to ensure that it can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs will be examined in the context of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy. The Department will continue to engage with key stakeholders to safeguard the recovery of the tertiary education sector. </p>  <p>  My Department held a recent meeting with DPER to discuss the potential impact of COVID on the Tertiary Education Sector. The Higher Education sector is a key element of the economy&rsquo;s economic and social infrastructure which also has a crucial role in recovery in supporting economic and social recovery.  The priority is to seek to safeguard that capacity against the backdrop of the broader economic crisis by ensuring that core provision is maintained and in particular by assessing the level of financial vulnerability that may threaten the viability of any specific HEI.  This aligns with the key principle of Government&rsquo;s approach to Covid-19 which is to seek to support financially stressed entities reflecting Covid impacts across all sectors of the economy where viability is at risk. Insofar as higher education research is concerned, the Department will continue to engage with DBEI and key funding agencies to respond to specific queries. </p>  <p>  In addition, a review is currently underway under the European Commission DG Reform&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme on Increasing the Future Sustainability of Higher and Further Education Provision in Ireland.  The review encompasses the review of the funding options for higher education included in the 2016 (Cassells) Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education.  The study is scheduled to be substantially complete in Q4 2020.</p></reply>

My Department has written to school management and asked schools to put in place arrangements to continue the delivery of education to students.  A series of guidance notes to support schools in how to effectively support and engage with their students continues to be compiled to address challenges in providing programmes of continued learning in the current context.</p><p>School and college buildings since May 18<sup>th</sup>are available for access by teachers to facilitate the organisation and distribution of remote learning. </p><p>Specific guidance on the continuity of schooling for primary and post-primary schools issued on Thursday 2nd April. Further guidance issued on 22nd  April, with a particular focus on supporting students with special educational needs and students at risk of educational disadvantage. These guidance documents are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The guidance is informed by feedback from school surveys and prompted by a growing demand in some schools seeking such guidance. The reaction from schools is that this material is particularly useful as they navigate the challenges associated with the new teaching and learning environment that has emerged through enforced closures of schools during the public health crises.</p><p>The nature of distant learning has required schools to take on a range of approaches to support their students. Schools and teachers have demonstrate great innovation in adapting to the new situation. Many schools are using digital resources and remote teaching as well as communicating with parents through email and digital apps to provide work for students. The Department is aware that many schools are using e-platforms to enable their teachers to provide work to students, particularly to students in examination classes, and to enable students to complete tasks and tests for assessment.</p><p>Resources to support the transition to distant learning are being provided by the Department support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST),. Scoilnet the Department&rsquo;s educational portal provides access to a wide variety of resources and information developed by various services including: the PDST, Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT), the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the National Council for Special Education. These resources can all be accessed at . Scoilnet also provides access to extensive educational resources including Worldbook Online, at www.scoilnet.ie</p><p>As part of the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 Enhancing Teaching Learning and Assessment, funding of &euro;210m for ICT Infrastructure will be distributed to schools over the five years of the Strategy. &euro;110m has issued over the lifetime of the strategy to date. &euro;50m is issuing now in the form of a grant payment to all eligible schools.  </p><p>In the context of the current public health crisis the funding can be focussed on assisting schools to address ICT needs to support the provision of remote learning.  This can include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with students who do not have access to devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning. </p><p>The Department will continue to work with the education partners to provide solutions in areas where digital and remote learning options may not be possible. </p><p>In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, I expect those going into sixth year in post primary schools to be a group that will receive a particular focus in the context or preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021.</p></reply>

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: </p>  <p>  Student grant payments for academic year 2019/20 will continue as normal. The duration and value of the grant will not change. </p>  <p>  Student grant applications for academic year 2020/21 will be assessed based on income earned in 2019. </p>  <p>  If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p>  <p>  The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1m added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.  Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. </p>  <p>  In December 2018 a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This funding continued into 2019 and 2020. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the funding allocation for the student grant scheme and the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) is determined in the context of the overall estimates and budgetary process undertaken by all Government Departments.  However, all proposals made in relation to education expenditure will be considered in the context of Budget 2021, having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

Guidance will issue shortly which will include information to support learners at each of the key stages of transition.  The aim of the distant learning approaches set out in this guidance is to ensure that children stay connected with learning to facilitate progression to the next level of their education.</p>  <p>  School communities have been learning to adjust and adapt to the challenges they face at this time and have taken up the challenge of staying connected with their students for teaching, learning and maintaining the social connections and supports that are so important for young people&rsquo;s wellbeing. </p>  <p>  I am aware that transitions across all areas of schooling are a key concern for educators, parents and pupils, and that the end of school reporting is more important than ever for the transition between primary and post primary school.  </p>  <p>  Circular 26/2011 requires at the end of the school year that schools report on four areas:</p>  <p>  - the child as a learner </p>  <p>  - the child&rsquo;s personal and social development </p>  <p>  - the child&rsquo;s progress with learning in curriculum areas or subjects </p>  <p>  - next steps in the child&rsquo;s learning, including ways for parents to help</p>  <p>  The NCCA Education Passport was developed to ensure a smoother transition for learners between primary and post primary schools. Since 2014/15, schools are required to use the NCCA Education Passport materials (available at www.ncca.ie/transfer) to support the reporting and transfer of pupil information at the end of sixth class. Primary schools should ensure that an Education Passport for each pupil is completed and sent to the relevant post primary school following confirmation of enrolment and, ideally, by the end of June. </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) in my Department has recently issued guidance for Primary Schools in relation to 6th class pupils who are due to transition this year. We know that for these for pupils the typical ceremonies, rites of passage, milestones, and social interactions have all been affected. The guidance for schools, outlines what can be done to support pupils at this time of transition. The guidance recognises that some pupils may need more preparation in advance of the transition, for example, pupils with Special Educational Needs; pupils whose families have been recently bereaved and pupils from vulnerable families. Schools are encouraged to ensure an effective two- way communication system is in place for parent/guardians so that they can clarify any queries they may have. Schools are advised that it is essential to communicate with the receiving post primary school.</p>  <p>  In addition to the guidance, NEPS psychologists continue to be available to provide advice and support to school principals, teachers and school communities.  NEPS is proactively exploring a number of innovative ways to continue to provide educational psychological services to school communities at this time.  </p>  <p>  My department is continuing to review and monitor the situation in accordance with the advice from public health authorities and will continue to issue advice and guidance to schools as appropriate.</p></reply>

Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>- It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie.  </p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools.  </p><p>Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed.</p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year.</p><p>A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year.</p></reply>

A core objective of the contingency plans will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p><p>The issues are also being considered by the Primary Education Forum which includes all stakeholders in the sector and it will also be addressed by the Advisory Group which involves representatives of stakeholders from the post-primary sector.</p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at   </p><p>In additional to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p> </p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p>  </p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at   <b></b></p><p>Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at  </p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at: </p><p>I also recently announced that a special &euro;10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby &euro;40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. &euro;10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>There are currently no proposals to review the existing criteria for the allocation of Special Education Teachers or Special Needs Assistants for schools, or to adjust the current criteria of the allocation of DEIS supports, or school class sizes, due to matters arising from COVID 19. This matter, and matters in relation to social distancing, will be kept under review in the context of public health advice regarding schools re-opening and the ongoing advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p><p>The DEIS programme allows for a reduced class size in Urban Band 1 primary schools with the application of a preferential staffing schedule to these schools of 20:1 at junior classes and 24:1 at senior classes to support those students at the highest risk of educational disadvantage. DEIS Plan acknowledges the allocation of teaching resources to DEIS primary schools with the highest concentrations of children at risk of educational disadvantage has served to improve learning outcomes.  It also commits to the evaluation of the level of teaching resources for schools participating in DEIS to be undertaken to inform future policy in this area.  </p><p>In order to facilitate this a Class Size Working Group was established comprising representatives from the Education Partners, the Educational Research Centre and the relevant Business Units in my Department. </p><p>A report on the work of this group is currently being finalised, and will take into consideration the feedback and observations of the working group members.  When the report is finalised its findings will inform future policy direction in this area. </p><p>Questions in relation to the staffing of Health Service Executive (HSE) Assessment Teams and HSE Therapy services should be referred to Department of Health and the HSE, however, it should be noted that an assessment of a particular diagnosis of special educational need is no longer required for pupils to access special education teaching support in schools and is not required for access to the SNA scheme for the 2020/21 school year.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p></reply>

This is the highest ever allocation to the sector and an increase of nearly &euro;2 billion since 2016. </p>  <p>  The number of teachers has increased from 63,556 in 2015/16 to almost 70,900 in 2019/20, an increase of over 7,300 teaching posts. </p>  <p>  Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the current school year and this has led to a steady improvement in the pupil teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period. </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period. Corresponding statistics from post primary level show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 13.8:1 to 13:1 during the same period. </p>  <p>  The annual staffing schedule determines the allocation of teachers to schools.  For the current school year, it operates on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1) which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.  At post-primary level teachers are allocated at a ratio of 19:1 in the Free Education System and 23:1 to schools in the fee-charging sector.  Approximately 300 teaching posts would be required for each 1 point adjustment to the primary staffing schedule, while approximately 1,150 teaching posts would be required for each 1 point adjustment on the post-primary side.</p>  <p>  The National Return to Work Safely Protocol will inform discussions with all education partners so that appropriate guidance for schools is developed and arrangements put in place in time for the new school year.</p></reply>

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.</p><p>Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: </p><p>Student grant payments for academic year 2019/20 will continue as normal. The duration and value of the grant will not change. </p><p>Student grant applications for academic year 2020/21 will be assessed based on income earned in 2019. </p><p>If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant.</p><p>The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p><p>The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).</p><p>The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1m added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.  Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In December 2018 a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This funding continued into 2019 and 2020. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the funding allocation for the student grant scheme and the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) is determined in the context of the overall estimates and budgetary process undertaken by all Government Departments.  However, all proposals made in relation to education expenditure will be considered in the context of Budget 2021, having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website,<i>www.revenue.ie.</i></p></reply>

Students will continue to receive their maintenance grants as normal and the duration or value of the grant will not change. </p><p>For the 20/21 academic year student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31December 2019. </p><p>However as you are aware, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision.</p><p>When an employment ceases, such as in cases of redundancy, there is always the possibility that the person could commence new employment shortly thereafter and there is also the possibility that the person will remain unemployed for a considerable length of time.  For this reason any applicant who is awarded a grant, or has their grant level increased, following the implementation of the change of circumstances conditions may be reviewed by SUSI later in the academic year.  </p><p>In the case of a change of circumstances all household income, and not just the income of the person experiencing the change, will be assessed/reassessed on the basis of the current year (2020). The change of circumstance is not applied retrospectively. Therefore, if the change occurs during the academic year, any award or adjustment will take effect from the month in which the change occurred.<b></b>This provision may benefit some students whose income has fallen in 2020 due to Covid-19 issues.</p><p>SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020. Students are advised to submit their renewal student grant application as soon as possible. The priority closing dates for the 2020/21 academic year are 11 June 2020 for renewal applicants and 9 July 2020 for new applicants.</p><p>Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, <i>www.susi.ie</i>. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

A core objective of the contingency plans will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice. </p><p>The issues are also being considered by the Primary Education Forum which includes all stakeholders in the sector and it will also be addressed by the Advisory Group which involves representatives of stakeholders from the post-primary sector. </p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period.  </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at</p><p>In additional to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs.

Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents. </p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment. </p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment.  </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions. </p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure.  </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who </p><p>teaches children with sensory impairment. </p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed.

It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area.</p><p>The NCSE's Local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs in relation to specialised provision.</p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area. </p><p>On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.</p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.</p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open additional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an additional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.</p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.</p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.</p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.</p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.</p></reply>

It will combine estimates of a student&rsquo;s expected performance  in a subject and level, with information about how students in the school have fared in this subject in recent years in line with national performance standards over time. </p>  <p>  The first source of data will be provided by the subject teacher. It will then be aligned in the school, with teachers consulting on the results before the school&rsquo;s principal reviews the process applied to assure the fair treatment of students. The school then sends the data to my Department.</p>  <p>  A detailed document A Guide to Calculated Grades for Leaving Certificate students 2020 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. It explains further how the system will work. Detailed guidance for teachers on the operation of the calculated grades system is being finalised for issue to schools shortly.</p>  <p>  There will be strong oversight and control and a number of inherent quality assurance measures to ensure students receive as fair a result as possible. The principles of equity, fairness and objectivity are paramount in the calculated grades system. Teachers are to focus objectively on information that is clearly about attainment in the subject and not about other factors such as the student&rsquo;s background or circumstances. </p>  <p>  Teachers are being asked to draw on existing records and other available evidence, to provide a fair, reasonable and carefully considered judgement of the most likely percentage mark that each student would have achieved if they had sat their examinations and completed coursework under normal conditions.</p>  <p>  Teachers will use a number of records in assessing a student&rsquo;s performance and progress; for example, classwork and homework; class assessments; examinations in school at Christmas or summer, mock exams and also coursework. They will not be simply passing on results from mock examinations or other tests. Junior Cycle results are not being used at an individual student level as a prediction of a student&rsquo;s likely performance in this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate.</p>  <p>  The teacher&rsquo;s judgement will be based on evidence of learning and achievement such as that indicated above up until the point of school closure on the evening of 12 March. Teachers will not set additional assessments for the purposes of determining an estimated percentage mark.</p>  <p>  In the case of coursework that has already been completed, a teacher&rsquo;s overall estimate should incorporate the mark they think that this coursework would have achieved if it had been marked in the usual way.</p>  <p>  If a teacher has a real or perceived conflict of interest with a student in their class they must declare this to the school principal. There will be additional oversight by a nominated teacher and a deputy principal in such cases.</p>  <p>  Where a student is studying one or more subjects outside of a recognised school, the Department will be flexible in accepting estimated marks and rankings from other schools or colleges, and will look at this issue on a case-by-case basis. In general, I can say that, provided an estimated mark and ranking can be generated from a teacher in a way that is fair to all candidates, my Department will seek to provide a calculated grade. Students will be able to use this calculated grade in the same way as a Leaving Certificate grade to satisfy minimum entry requirements.</p>  <p>  When it was thought possible to hold written examinations but not orals or music performance tests, 100% marks were awarded for the cancelled orals and performance tests.  Awarding 100% for orals and music performance tests in the calculated grade system would not be fair to students. Calculated grades are the best way of getting an accurate estimation of what a student would have achieved across all components of their examination. </p>  <p>  Teachers of languages will assess the student&rsquo;s oral performance as well as their written skills to come to an estimated mark for each student. It was never intended to offer 100% for all practical or project work. Detailed guidance to assist teachers in formulating the estimated grade for each student will issue shortly and will address these components.</p>  <p>  In the case of students who are entered to take their examinations through Irish, the teacher will base the estimate of the student&rsquo;s likely performance on the assumption that this bonus is included in the estimate.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the thousands of students who have applied to study in Northern Ireland, Britain, Europe and elsewhere. Contacts with the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland continue, as well as contacts with officials in the other devolved Governments in the UK. Departmental officials are engaging directly with UCAS to work through the key issues.   I have also written to my counterparts across the European Union to explain the decision regarding the Leaving Certificate and to ask for as much flexibility as possible for students coming from Ireland to study in other Member States. </p></reply>

While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed.

This reflects a similar approach that has been adopted by providers across the wider education system. If a student is having issues with the programme on offer or in accessing a provider&rsquo;s services, they can engage with their provider to address these issues.  </p>  <p>  It is not within the remit of my Department to pursue providers for refunds arising from fees paid by students. This is a matter between the student and their provider.  However, as part of the conditions for a provider to have its programmes included on the Interim List for Eligible Programmes (ILEP) and therefore be eligible to recruit International Students, it must have established policies and procedures for the refund of fees to students in addition to a complaints procedure in the event of student complaints. These should be communicated to the student at time of enrolment.  If the student exhausts the internal complaints procedure of the provider and is still unhappy about the outcome, they can make a complaint to the Immigration Delivery Service of the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, in the case of a complaint regarding refunds, this can only relate to whether a provider has followed their internal refunds policy. If the provider&rsquo;s refund policy was followed, there can be no further intervention into a private agreement between a provider and their student.</p></reply>

These matters are being examined by Government.</p>  <p>  As the law now stands, a mother is entitled to this leave irrespective of the duration of her current employment. The mother can take maternity leave from casual or part-time employment. She can take up to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, and up to a further 16 weeks of unpaid leave. Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth. As Minister of State for Justice and Equality, the legislation that governs the provision of maternity leave is my responsibility.  The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  In addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.  </p>  <p>  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday.</p></reply>

In this regard, it oversees the implementation of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) 2015 - 2024. </p><p>The NDIS is the key framework for policy and action to address the needs of people with disabilities while the CES sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to work, are supported and enabled to do so. The CES Implementation Group, which monitors the implementation of the Strategy, has an independent chair, Mr. Fergus Finlay, and is co-ordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality.  </p><p>The second Action Plan (2019 &ndash; 2021) for the CES, published in December 2019, provides a focus for the work of the Implementation Group for the next period in the lifetime of the Strategy and sets clear deliverables and milestones for each action so that implementation can be monitored by the Implementation Group. The Government regards the new plan as a vital building block in the overall implementation of the Strategy. </p><p>Accessing and staying in employment for people with disabilities is difficult but can be achieved with appropriate supports.  It requires many Government services to work for that individual and importantly to work together to provide a joined-up service.  If the Action Plan can make improvements in the area of employment it can lead to improvements across all areas.</p><p>The Department does not provide grants to businesses but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does offer a number of workplace supports schemes for people with disabilities and their employers or prospective employers, including the Reasonable Accommodation Fund (which offers a workplace equipment/adaptation grant, an employee retention grant and a personal reader grant) and the Wage Subsidy Scheme.  </p><p>More information is available at this link: <i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.1150.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000128#WRCC03300"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the responsibility of each individual Member State of the EU to address the challenges in their own state regarding the impacts of Covid-19 on persons resident in their state, including applicants for International Protection and other migrants.  </p><p>In order to support Member States and to help protect migrants and asylum seekers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the European Commission has prepared a formal guidance document called &lsquo;Guidance on the implementation of relevant EU provisions in the area of asylum and return procedures and on resettlement&rdquo; with the support of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex). This was formally adopted by Member States on 16 April 2020 and it illustrates how to ensure continuity of procedures as much as possible while fully ensuring the protection of people&rsquo;s health, given the healthcare measures introduced by Member States.</p><p>The Commission advices are that in order to prevent and contain the spread of Covid-19, public health measures such as medical screening, social distancing, quarantine and isolation should be applied as necessary for third-country nationals, including applicants for international protection, resettled persons or third-country nationals illegally staying in the Union provided that these measures are reasonable, proportionate and non-discriminatory. </p><p>In line with the EU Commission guidance I can assure the Deputy that my Department continues to follow HSE and Public Health guidelines in relation to measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 within our Direct Provision accommodation system and our international protection system generally. We will continue to follow the Commission&rsquo;s guidance as regards asylum measures in the context of the pandemic as appropriate to Ireland. For example, Ireland continues to accept new asylum applications as normal as per the EU advices. </p><p>As regards our Direct Provision system, together with the HSE, we have put in place a range of measures in all of the Department&rsquo;s Accommodation Centres to address any cases of Covid-19 if or when they arise.  This includes provision for self-isolation facilities in Centres and a number of offsite self-isolation centres around the State.  In all matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we work collaboratively with the HSE to implement their public health advice. </p><p>We are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at: <i></i>.</p><p>That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.</p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.</p><p>The established procedure across all centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. We have opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities (with capacity for 299 people) in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dundalk. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. </p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Caherciveen and Tullamore.  </p><p>We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any centre. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.  </p><p>The vast majority of the rooms in the new accommodation being used to support social and physical distancing are twin rooms accommodating two people. If any person is being accommodated in these locations based on an identified vulnerability (age or medical condition), they have their own bedroom and their own bathroom to facilitate their cocooning.</p><p>We have cocooned all residents over the age of 65 and anyone advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness. </p><p>In addition to the formal guidance provided by the EU Commission, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), will continue to assess how the Covid-19 pandemic affects asylum services within Member States. The EASO will provide support and advice as necessary to all Member States (including Ireland) including the ongoing provision of training and professional development through their Training and Professional Development Centre.</p><p>The European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018 transposed the EU Reception Conditions Directive into Irish law. Under the whole-of-Government approach, a number of Government Departments and agencies work closely together to ensure the necessary supports and services are provided to our residents. You can be assured, in these unprecedented times, that my Department will, in conjunction with all other responsible Departments and Agencies, continue to provide such services to the best of our abilities in line with the provisions of the Directive.</p></reply>

I have also been regularly briefed by the Commissioner on the matter. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Garda&iacute; are dedicated to tackling gang-related violence in Drogheda and ensuring the safety of all citizens in the community and the wider area.   There is a dedicated policing operation in place, Operation Stratus, which specifically targets the ongoing feud.  This includes high visibility patrols and checkpoints, days of action and covert policing initiatives targeting specific individuals.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Garda resources in the region have been increased significantly.  I understand from the Garda authorities that there are 158 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Drogheda District at the end of April 2020, representing a 49% increase compared to the end of 2015. There are now also 19 Garda staff, an increase of 73% in the same time period. Taken together, this increase in the Garda workforce represents a very significant increase in operational policing hours in Drogheda. In addition, these are supported and supplemented by personnel from the Regional Armed Support Unit, Divisional Detective, Drugs and Crime Units as well as  Divisional Roads Policing Units as required. Liaison is ongoing with relevant stakeholders, including the Local Authorities, Tusla and the HSE.</p>  <p>  I further note that a key principle arising from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing is that policing is not the responsibility of the police alone, but also involves other agencies of Government, such as health or social services, as well as other sectors of society.  This principle is at the centre of a new policy on community safety which is being developed in my Department.  The policy, which will be given a statutory basis in the new Policing and Community Safety Bill, proposes to establish and support a system of community safety at local level across the country.  Through cross-sectoral collaboration, and by drawing on the available services, these systems will be best placed to identify, support and implement, community safety according to the needs of the local community.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, officials in my Department are examining how the community in Drogheda can be better supported in the more immediate future including through engagement with the local authority who I know have been very active in delivering on actions to support local communities affected by the increase in violence.  If it would be of assistance, officials in my Department are available to meet with the Deputy to further discuss the situation in Drogheda and the possible responses and, if you agree, I can have that meeting arranged. The further advancement of the specific commitment referred to by the Deputy is a matter for the next Government.</p>  <p>  Finally I can reassure the Deputy that my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na keep all criminal legislation under continuous review and that unprecedented resources are being provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to help them address the challenge of gangland activities and other forms of criminality in the State - the Garda budget for 2020 amounts to &euro;1.88 billion.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

No more than two people are allowed to use the laundry room at the same time and a rota system has been put in place in the shared kitchen with a limit on the number of persons allowed in the kitchen.  All residents have been advised of these measures and there is adequate signage advising of same. Meals are delivered to any person self-isolating or cocooning onsite, however, as I have advised the Deputy, there are no such persons presently in the Temple Accommodation Centre.</p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for all centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as needed. Other Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is distributed as needed and in line with HPSC guidelines on its appropriate use in residential settings. In addition to the regular supplies of hand sanitiser, the Temple Accommodation Centre has also received 1,400 face masks, 1,000 medical aprons and 1,000 pairs of latex gloves. These items were distributed to the centre on 21 April 2020. </p><p>We have approximately 7,700 residents living in our accommodation centres, of whom approximately 1,500 residents are living in own-door accommodation. While all own door accommodation is fully utilised at this time, it is our practice to prioritise families for such accommodation when it becomes available.</p></reply>

More details about this service can be found at <i>www.legalaidboard.ie</i>, while other free parent support services which provide help and advice are available from <i>www.onefamily.ie</i>and <i>www.treoir.ie</i></p><p>The Judiciary and the Courts Service have advised that the District Court will continue to hear urgent matters in all District Court Districts throughout the country as before, and will resume hearings of certain other urgent matters.  Urgent matters are now extended to include additional areas in Criminal, Family, and Child Care Law.  In the area of Family Law the President of the District Court announced 8 May changes for matters which can be dealt with.  </p><p>These include the following:</p><p>-Applications and hearings for breach of maintenance or access that have occurred during the emergency period or applications and hearings for temporary guardianship orders. </p><p>- Remote call-overs and hearings may be conducted in some courts. </p><p>- Consent orders that do not require the hearing of evidence may be applied for by email by the applicant&rsquo;s solicitor exhibiting consent in writing from the respondent&rsquo;s solicitor.</p><p>Following consideration by an assigned Judge orders will issue from the Court Office as appropriate without the need for the parties or their legal representatives to attend court.</p><p>In the current exceptional circumstances, while court offices are still open, they are only open for essential business, and by appointment only.  According to the Practice Direction of the President of the District Court, a case which does not come into the defined urgent category can be treated as urgent if a good case can be made, and this will be decided, by the Court, on a case by case basis.  The full details of the statement from the President of the District Court can be found on the website of the Courts Service.</p><p>I hope this information is of some help to families and I would like to emphasise that I am appealing to everyone to remember at all times that the welfare of the child is paramount.</p></reply>

However, the Irish Prison Service maintains regular contact with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government regarding the release of prisoners who have identified themselves to prison services as homeless or a risk of homelessness.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Irish Prison Service is that all releases from Irish prisons and places of detention are planned releases, in order to support offenders in making informed and effective transitions from prison to the community in compliance with statutory, legal and sentencing provisions.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that, if a sentenced prisoner informs prison authorities that they were homeless prior to coming into custody, or that they are at risk of homelessness on release, they are referred to the prison-based resettlement service. The resettlement service works with the prisoner and the relevant local authority to identify possible accommodation solutions in preparation for their release and reintegration to the community. </p>  <p>  I also understand that the Irish Prison Service provides funding to enable the Irish Association for Social Integration Opportunities to provide Resettlement Coordinators in each of our closed prisons and that the number of Resettlement Coordinators across the prison estate has increased from 3 to 12 in recent years. I am informed that as part of additional measures to assist prisoners prepare for release during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Irish Prison Service has assigned a further 6 staff to assist with the resettlement effort. </p>  <p>  The Deputy requested specific information on the number of prisoners released from prison to emergency homeless accommodation or no pre-arranged accommodation over the last 12 months by prison and by month. I am advised that the Irish Prison Service that it does not record statistics in the specific format requested. However, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that in 2019, the Resettlement Service assisted 363 sentenced prisoners who had declared a risk of homelessness to submit their social housing application in advance of their release. I am further informed that, in 2020 to date, the Resettlement Service has engaged with 457 sentenced prisoners in custody and has submitted 119 applications for social housing support on behalf of prisoners this year. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing communication between the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government regarding the release of prisoners who have identified themselves to prison services as at risk of homelessness. I understand that this contact has further increased in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that the Irish Prison Service, working in partnership with the Irish Red Cross, has developed a release information pack for prisoners who leaving custody during the current pandemic. The information pack includes information on changes to social norms since the introduction of restrictions including social distancing, new hygiene practices, details of reduced opening hours for public services and details of support and advocacy services available, including housing supports.  </p></reply>

The offsite facilities are supported by a non-profit (Section 39) organisation and healthcare staff. </p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to work hard with local management, health agencies, and NGOs to provide every support possible to our residents at this difficult time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.1206.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000129#WRDD02800"><p>I want to assure the Deputy that my Department is doing everything it can to protect the health and welfare of residents and staff in our accommodation centres, as well as that of the wider community. My Department is working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate.</p><p>All centres, including St. Patrick's Accommodation Centre in Monaghan, are following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at its website <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>. That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.</p><p>The established procedure across all our centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated off-site self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE decides that they can safely return to their centre. My Department has opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities (in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dundalk) with capacity for 299 people. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom.</p><p>Since the start of the year, over 1,550 permanent and temporary new Direct Provision beds have been procured including the new dedicated centres in Rosslare Harbour, Caherciveen and Tullamore. We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any centre. We intend to continue this policy after the crisis. All residents over the age of 65 and those advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness have been cocooned. </p><p>Specifically in relation to St. Patrick's Accommodation Centre, I can confirm that there are no residents currently self-isolating on-site. Centre management has introduced the following arrangements to support social and physical distancing and good hygiene practices in the centre at this time:</p><p>-Disposable items are used at mealtimes and staff are making tea and coffee to prevent cross contamination in the tea station area.  Food, including bread, is wrapped in portions in cellophane, again to prevent contamination. </p><p>-All meat supplied to the centre is Halal and their suppliers have continued to deliver without disruption.  In relation to the preparation of meals, unfortunately, the main kitchen was closed for renovation in early March so it is not currently available to residents. In addition, the HSE have advised management to close the smaller kitchens, as it was not possible to adhere to the social and physical distancing measures required at this time.  The centre staff are currently preparing all meals for the residents in the centre. </p><p>-In relation to meals available during Ramadan, the normal practice was that a selected group of residents prepared the specialist meals in the main kitchen for all residents who are observing Ramadan in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Accommodation Centre. However, this year when management approached the residents who usually cook for the people observing Ramadan they indicated that they preferred not to be involved on this occasion. Instead, the centre chefs are preparing the specialist meals for residents to the best of their ability and using Halal meats. Special dates and drinks, herbs and spices, which are traditional during Ramadan, are also provided on a weekly basis to residents.  </p><p>-All medical prescriptions are being delivered to the centre by local Community Garda&iacute;. </p><p>-The playground is currently closed in order to adhere to social and physical distancing requirements.  </p><p>More generally, residents in all centres have been made aware of the need to practice social and physical distancing and good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Translations of public health advice have been provided to centres. During this time, centres have been asked to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser is in place for all centres and this is distributed as needed. Other PPE is also distributed as needed and in line with HPSC guidelines on its appropriate use in residential settings.</p></reply>

We are working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate.</p><p>All accommodation centres, including Ciuin House, are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>. That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.  </p><p>Shared bedrooms and communal living space are provided in numerous settings. Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. </p><p>The direction from the HSE is that during the COVID crisis non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.</p><p>The established procedure across all Centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department has opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and Dundalk, with a total capacity of 299 rooms. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. </p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Caherciveen and Tullamore.  </p><p>We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any of our centres. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.  </p><p>All residents aged 65 or older and those advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness have been cocooned due to their particular vulnerability to this virus.  </p><p>We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website <i>www.accommodationcentres.ie</i>. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. With Ramadan underway, we have also prepared and circulated information for centre managers and residents with practical supports on observing Ramadan during the current COVID restrictions.</p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings. </p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.</p><p>Generally, residents of Centres are subject to the same current public health measures as the rest of the population, for example, the right to exercise within a 5km radius, attend medical appointments or to shop for food or other necessities as set out in Government guidelines. However, as with everyone else, where a public health issue arises, Public Health officials may advise that residents stay in their centre and restrict movement for a time while they monitor the situation. </p><p>Healthcare workers living in Direct Provision accommodation are eligible to apply for accommodation under the HSE&rsquo;s Temporary Accommodation Scheme announced on 10 April 2020.  We are actively encouraging all healthcare workers living in our centres to apply for this temporary accommodation for their protection and that of other centre residents and staff. We have provided information, forms and guidance. We have also asked the NGO community to support this initiative and to help to bring it to the attention of residents through their support networks.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Department takes any complaints from residents very seriously and all residents are made fully aware of their ability to contact the Department at any time in confidence. If a complaint is not resolved to the satisfaction of the resident, they can also avail of the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children, as appropriate. If the Deputy wishes to raise any specific concerns regarding this particular centre with me, I would be happy to have my officials follow up.</p><p>In the meantime, the Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to work closely with the HSE and centre management during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.</p></reply>

That has always been our priority.</p><p>I do appreciate that the circumstances in which the Skellig Accommodation Centre was opened did not allow for full engagement with local representatives, communities and services; to inform and reassure them and to answer their questions. That is certainly something that I, Minister Flanagan and our officials regret. But, during a public health emergency the decision to move people to a dedicated accommodation centre was seen as an appropriate positive response. </p><p>All centres are following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at its website <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>.  That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic. My Department is working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate.</p><p>At the very outset of the crisis, my Department discussed with the HSE the fact that we were accommodating some people in commercial hotels that the Department did not have exclusive use of. This was seen as higher risk at that time in the early stages of the pandemic.</p><p>For that reason, we needed to move people to dedicated accommodation centres where they could receive the full set of State supports and services. To do this, we needed to open more accommodation. The Skellig Star hotel in Cahersiveen had been offered to us and was available for immediate occupancy.</p><p>We also opened new centres in Rosslare Harbour and Tullamore and temporary accommodation in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.</p><p>In total, 600 people were relocated to support social and physical distancing including just over 100 people to the new centre in Cahersiveen.</p><p>The residents arrived in Caherciveen on March 18th and 19th.  Some of them did come from a hotel in Dublin at which a case of COVID-19 was subsequently confirmed in an unrelated guest.  My Department was not told of that confirmed case until it was brought to Minister Flanagan&rsquo;s attention by Deputy Catherine Murphy on 6 April 2020.</p><p>From subsequent discussions with management at the hotel, our understanding is that the guest involved had only stayed at the hotel for one night in early March when they fell ill. The guest was removed to hospital and their close contacts were asked by the HSE to self-isolate for 14 days as is the norm. No one that we were accommodating in the hotel was approached as a traced contact, and there was no indication whatsoever that anyone we relocated from that hotel was in any way unwell, was awaiting a test or a test result.  In fact, it was well over a fortnight after they arrived before any of our residents in Cahersiveen began to show symptoms and were confirmed as positive for COVID 19.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, medical information such as testing, test results and the release of data relating to same are matters for the HSE in a public health context. We can confirm that, in line with our agreed policy with the HSE, anyone who has tested positive has been moved to a dedicated self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. Everyone else in the centre was asked to self-isolate while the HSE continued to monitor the situation. Thankfully, the HSE has confirmed that that period of self-isolation has ended today (20 May 2020) and all residents are now subject to the same restrictions as anyone else under Phase 1 of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap.  </p><p>There are currently 69 residents (including 9 children) onsite in the centre, which has capacity for 150 residents, and 56 bedrooms. Residents are a mix of single people and small sized families. All single residents have been offered their own bedroom and all bedrooms in the centre are en suite. Some residents have declined this offer and have indicated that they wish to self-isolate with their roommate as a family unit. We continue to encourage these residents to accept the offer of their own room at this time.</p><p>Guidance has been provided by the HSE to centre management on the enhanced cleaning arrangements required at this time including through an onsite visit by a HSE infection control specialist. This applies to bedrooms, corridors, staircases, the dining room, kitchen, laundry room, lift, public toilets and reception and public areas. This is being strictly adhered to by centre management and staff.</p><p>My Department is working closely with the HSE and centre management to provide additional supports for residents during this time. There is a HSE Community Development Worker onsite at the Centre seven days a week to monitor the health of residents.  This person is supported by a wider healthcare team.  Additional outdoor space has been opened up with some seating provided and, exercise equipment has been set up in the outdoor area for residents&rsquo; use. This outdoor equipment has been installed with the knowledge and support of HSE public health, and will be operated under their direction for safe use.</p><p>The residents are currently provided with three meals and snacks daily. However, in line with the overall policy objectives for accommodation centres, the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period. In the meantime, the chefs in the centre are working with the residents to find out about preferred meals and staff have been asked to source and provide ethnic snacks for residents. Kettles have been provided in rooms so that residents can make refreshments throughout the day rather than using communal facilities and meals are also being delivered to rooms.

Under the Finance (1909-10) Act 1910, all retailer&rsquo;s licences expire on 30 September, and are renewable. </p>  <p>  Licensed premises to which on-licences are attached, including public houses, are unable to operate under current Covid 19 emergency provisions.</p>  <p>  Simplified and streamlined procedures for the renewal of licences are set out in section 4 of the Courts (No.2) Act 1986. Since enactment of that legislation, an applicant does not have to apply to the annual licensing District Court for a certificate as to their good character and the peaceable and orderly manner in which the premises have been operated. Where premises have been licensed in the immediately preceding year, licences may, on application prior to expiry of the existing licence, be renewed by the Revenue Commissioners without production of any such court certificate unless an objection to such renewal has been lodged in the District Court. Applications must be accompanied by the relevant excise duty and a tax clearance certificate under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. </p>  <p>  In practice, the great majority of licenses are renewed annually by the Revenue Commissioners without undue delay or excessive cost to the licensee. </p>  <p>  Rates of duty applicable to licence renewal are applied by the Revenue Commissioners under the Finance Acts. I am informed that the excise duty applicable to renewal of a public house licence is based on the annual turnover of the premises, less excluded turnover. The latter refers to turnover which is not related to the sale of intoxicating liquor or arising from the provision of meals. </p>  <p>  It appears therefore that reduced turnover due to non-operation of such premises under current Covid 19 emergency provisions  may result in reduced rates of duty on renewal of licences in due course.</p></reply>

In addition, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands.  This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles among the various Garda divisions.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 2020 to date and as of 12 May, 6 additional vehicles have been assigned to the Westmeath Division, of which 1 car was assigned to the Athlone District and 5 cars were assigned to the Mullingar District. </p><p>I am further informed that in 2020 to date and as of 12 May, 4 additional vehicles have been assigned to the Roscommon-Longford Division, of which 2 cars have been assigned to the Roscommon District and 2 cars have been assigned to the Longford District. </p><p>The following table, conveyed to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the vehicles attached to Roscommon/ Longford Division and Westmeath Division as at 12 May 2020, including the allocations identified in this response.  <table>    <tr>       <th>ROSCOMMON-LONGFORD DIVISION</th>       <th>Cars</th>       <th>Vans</th>       <th>Bikes</th>       <th>4x4</th>       <th>*Others</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CASTLEREA DISTRICT</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>GRANARD DISTRICT</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LONGFORD DISTRICT</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ROSCOMMON DISTRICT</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>WESTMEATH DIVISION</th>       <th>Cars</th>       <th>Vans</th>       <th>Bikes</th>       <th>4x4</th>       <th>*Others</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ATHLONE   DISTRICT</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MULLINGAR   DISTRICT</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>62</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>57</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>78</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*The category 'Others' refers to MPV, SUV, Minibus or Prisoner Conveyance Vehicles  </p><p>It may be noted that significant capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with the Courts Service.</p>  <p>  In response to the current public health emergency, a series of important measures were announced on Monday the 16th March and, most recently on Friday 8th May, by the Chief Justice and the President of the District Court. The measures are focused on ensuring essential access to the administration of justice in a manner fully respecting public safety and considering government public health advice.</p>  <p>  It is in the context of these measures that Judge Brian O'Shea, the District Judge assigned to Wexford, has directed that all business be moved from Gorey to Wexford courthouse until the end of this term.  I understand that the Courts Service has sent an email to the local court users to inform them of the revised arrangements</p>  <p>  This an interim measure to allow for the use of videolink technology (particularly to avoid the unnecessary transport of prisoners during the pandemic) and to facilitate greater social distancing in a larger court building.  </p>  <p>  The Courts Service expect business to resume as normal in Gorey once circumstances permit and the situation will continue to be kept under tight review.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the current public health emergency is causing a great deal of anxiety for everyone and I am grateful for the efforts of all, including users of our courts, in supporting efforts to ensure continuity of administration of justice while upholding the public health measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </p></reply>

GYDPs are community based, multi-agency, crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour. They aim to support young people to develop and mature through positive interventions and interactions with a local project.  GYDPs provide a range of education and training programmes e.g. academic support, IT, employment preparation and specific job training. </p><p>Since 2015, GYDPs have been co-funded under the Programme for Employability Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) of the European Social Fund (ESF) 2014-2020.</p><p>My Department is pursuing an ambitious programme for the future development of GYDP services, working closely with community organisations and with expert support from the Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice project in the University of Limerick. </p><p>The funding provided for Garda Youth Diversion Projects in the years 2018 to date is set out in the following table.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Amount</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;13.7m (expenditure)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;15.8m (expenditure)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;18.3m (allocation)</td>    </tr> </table> The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026 has recently been published for public consultation by my colleague the Minister for State David Stanton.  An online questionnaire is available until the end of June to allow members of the public, including of course young people, to express their views.  Further information is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

Passengers arriving by plane or ferry are requested to self-isolate for 14 days. They are provided with an information leaflet explaining the request and with a form to complete setting out their contact details and where they will self-isolate.</p>  <p>  In the current climate we are operating in a situation where people should only be travelling where it is essential, and the numbers arriving into Ireland are very small, the majority of which are Irish citizens returning home. Any person intending to travel who may not be in a position to self-isolate should, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, reconsider their need to travel to Ireland at this time. There are a limited number of exempt categories of passengers, for example supply chain workers (such as pilots, hauliers or maritime crew members) or passengers who are transiting en route to another jurisdiction including Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  On behalf of the health authorities, the collection of public health passenger locator forms and the system of spot checks and follow up calls are being rolled out on an administrative basis by officials from the Border Management Unit (BMU) of my Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). The BMU operate the scheme at Dublin Airport on behalf of the health authorities, which, at this time, is the principal route through which people are entering the State by air.  </p>  <p>  The BMU at Dublin Airport, on behalf of the health authorities, has established a system to follow-up on all arrivals at a proportionate rate of a minimum of 70%, after removal of the exempt categories of passengers. The cohort of passengers failing to answer initial phone calls are followed up with repeated further telephone contacts. The first calls are made two days after passengers have arrived into the State. For any passengers staying in the State for up to 14 days or more, a second call will be made on day 10 to ensure they are still residing at the address provided and self-isolating.   </p></reply>

We are working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate. </p><p>All accommodation centres are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>. That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.  </p><p>Shared bedrooms and communal living space are provided in numerous settings. Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. </p><p>The direction from the HSE is that during the COVID crisis non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.</p><p>The established procedure across all Centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department has opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and Dundalk, with a total capacity of 299 rooms. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. </p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Caherciveen and Tullamore.  </p><p>We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any of our centres. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.  </p><p>All residents aged 65 or older and those advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness have been cocooned due to their particular vulnerability to this virus.  </p><p>We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website <i>www.accommodationcentres.ie</i>. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. With Ramadan underway, we have also prepared and circulated information for centre managers and residents with practical supports on observing Ramadan during the current COVID restrictions.</p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings. </p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.</p><p>Generally, residents of Centres are subject to the same current public health measures as the rest of the population, for example, the right to exercise within a 5km radius, attend medical appointments or to shop for food or other necessities as set out in Government guidelines. However, as with everyone else, where a public health issue arises, Public Health officials may advise that residents stay in their centre and restrict movement for a time while they monitor the situation. </p><p>Healthcare workers living in Direct Provision accommodation are eligible to apply for accommodation under the HSE&rsquo;s Temporary Accommodation Scheme announced on 10 April 2020.  We are actively encouraging all healthcare workers living in our centres to apply for this temporary accommodation for their protection and that of other centre residents and staff. We have provided information, forms and guidance. We have also asked the NGO community to support this initiative and to help to bring it to the attention of residents through their support networks.</p><p>We will continue to work closely with the HSE and centre management during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.</p></reply>

For international English language students, this means that they will continue to be able to work if they so wish, but they must also re-enrol in an on-line course of study to adhere to the conditions of their permission. Officials from my Department have engaged with MEI (Marketing English in Ireland), the representative body for the majority of language schools in Ireland. They have confirmed that most colleges are now offering on-line courses, and students should contact their college directly to make any necessary arrangements.</p><p>In relation to persons with existing permission under Directive 2004/38/EC (Free Movement Directive), the automatic renewal is subject to the requirement that the person is complying with the requirements of the Directive. </p><p>The Registration Office in Burgh Quay and all Registration Offices for non-Dublin residents operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain temporarily closed due to COVID-19. Consequently, the requirement to present at a registration office to register a new permission or renew a current permission is also temporarily suspended. </p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage the Deputy to view our updates on the Immigration Service website at:</p><p><i></i></p><p>A detailed Frequently Asked Questions document on the COVID-19 impact on immigration and international protection can also be found on the website.

More details about this service can be found at <i>www.legalaidboard.ie</i>, while other free parent support services which provide help and advice are available from <i>www.onefamily.ie</i>and <i>www.treoir.ie</i><b><i></i></b></p><p>The Judiciary and the Courts Service have advised that the District Court will continue to hear urgent matters in all District Court Districts throughout the country as before, and will resume hearings of certain other urgent matters.  Urgent matters are now extended to include additional areas in Criminal, Family, and Child Care Law.  In the area of Family Law the President of the District Court announced 8 May changes for matters which can be dealt with.<b></b></p><p>These include the following:  <b></b></p><p>- Applications and hearings for breach of maintenance or access that have occurred during the emergency period or applications and hearings for temporary guardianship orders.<b></b></p><p><b>- </b>Remote call-overs and hearings may be conducted in some courts.<b></b></p><p><b>- </b>Consent orders that do not require the hearing of evidence may be applied for by email by the applicant&rsquo;s solicitor exhibiting consent in writing from the respondent&rsquo;s solicitor.  <b></b></p><p>Following consideration by an assigned Judge orders will issue from the Court Office as appropriate without the need for the parties or their legal representatives to attend court.</p><p>In the current exceptional circumstances, while court offices are still open, they are only open for essential business, and by appointment only.  According to the Practice Direction of the President of the District Court, a case which does not come into the defined urgent category can be treated as urgent if a good case can be made, and this will be decided, by the Court, on a case by case basis.  The full details of the statement from the President of the District Court can be found on the website of the Courts Service.  <b></b></p><p>I hope this information is of some help to families and I would like to emphasise that I am appealing to everyone to remember at all times that the welfare of the child is paramount.</p></reply>

Covid-19 in a prison setting would present significant challenges for prison management in terms of controlling the spread of the virus amongst staff and prisoners, and the provision of appropriate medical treatment to affected persons and the maintenance of staffing levels.</p><p>A significant amount of work has been carried out by the Irish Prison Service to address this challenge, informed and guided by the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Council of Europe. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, in March this year, I approved a number of actions to assist the Irish Prison Service to reduce the numbers of prisoners in custody, including the temporary release of low-risk prisoners, in order to ensure effective infection control measure were possible. </p><p>In the first instance, the approach adopted included granting temporary release to low risk prisoners who were serving sentences of less than 12 months for non-violent offences. Subsequently, prisoners assessed as low risk who had less than 6 months to serve were also granted temporary release from some prisons depending on the risks present.</p><p>I am informed that all prisoners granted temporary release were assessed on a case-by-case basis.  The primary factor in the consideration of any prisoner for early release remains public safety and risks assessed included any convictions for domestic abuse, such as breach of barring orders which present significant risks at the present time. I am informed that, on 19 May 2020 there were 752 prisoners in custody with less than 6 months remaining on their sentence. It is important to note, however, that many of these prisoners will not be eligible for temporary release due to the nature of their offence, the risk to public safety or further charges pending which remand them to custody beyond the expiration of their current sentence.</p><p>As a result of the measures taken, I am informed that an initial 470 prisoners were granted temporary release and that, since then, further periods of temporary release have been granted resulting in a total of over 600 prisoners receiving temporary release, including community return, since the outset of this pandemic. As the Deputy will appreciate, the size of the prison population changes on a daily basis, as new committals and remands are made by the courts and releases occur as prisoners reach the end of their sentences. However, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that, due to the granting of temporary release and a reduced number of committals from the Courts, the prison population has reduced from 4,235 on 11 March 2020 to 3,763 on 20 May 2020. This represents a reduction of 472 or just over 11% over this period.</p><p>I am informed that the following table sets out the prison population and the number of prisoners on temporary release for dates within the period in 2019 and 2020 referred to by the Deputy.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Date</th>       <th>Total Prison Population </th>       <th>Number on Temporary Release </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11 March 2019</td>       <td>3984</td>       <td>217</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20 May 2019</td>       <td>3999</td>       <td>243</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11 March 2020</td>       <td>4235</td>       <td>343</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20 May 2020</td>       <td>3763</td>       <td>427</td>    </tr> </table> As the Deputy will appreciate, given the current number of prisoners in custody, the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners. I am informed that single-cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of less than 3,000 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety. I am further informed that, in some cases, prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity. I understand that family members and friends often elect or are assigned a shared cell. I am further informed that shared cell accommodation can in certain cases be very beneficial from a management point of view, particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm, and that there will always be a need for certain prisoners to be accommodated together.</p><p>I am informed that information regarding in-cell occupancy is collated by the Irish Prison Service on a quarterly basis. The data for the April Census is currently being finalised for publication. I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the number of prisoners sharing cells has been reduced by 146 from 1,892 in January 2020 to 1,746 in April 2020.  </p><p>The Deputy may be interested to note that this and a wide range of other statistical information is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service at <i>www.irishprisons.ie</i></p></reply>

Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. </p><p>The direction from the HSE is that during the COVID crisis non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.</p><p>The established procedure across all Centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department has opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and Dundalk, with a total capacity of 299 rooms. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. </p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Caherciveen and Tullamore.  </p><p>We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any of our centres. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.  </p><p>All residents aged 65 or older and those advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness have been cocooned due to their particular vulnerability to this virus.  </p><p>We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website <i>www.accommodationcentres.ie</i>. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. With Ramadan underway, we have also prepared and circulated information for centre managers and residents with practical supports on observing Ramadan during the current COVID restrictions.</p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings. </p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.</p><p>Generally, residents of Centres are subject to the same current public health measures as the rest of the population, for example, the right to exercise within a 5km radius, attend medical appointments or to shop for food or other necessities as set out in Government guidelines. However, as with everyone else, where a public health issue arises, Public Health officials may advise that residents stay in their centre and restrict movement for a time while they monitor the situation. </p><p>Healthcare workers living in Direct Provision accommodation are eligible to apply for accommodation under the HSE&rsquo;s Temporary Accommodation Scheme announced on 10 April 2020.  We are actively encouraging all healthcare workers living in our centres to apply for this temporary accommodation for their protection and that of other centre residents and staff. We have provided information, forms and guidance. We have also asked the NGO community to support this initiative and to help to bring it to the attention of residents through their support networks.</p><p>We will continue to work closely with the HSE and centre management during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.</p></reply>

Generally, new international protection applicants are initially accommodated in Baleseskin before being allocated accommodation in one of our network of centres around the State. In Balseskin, applicants are offered health screening by a permanent onsite HSE medical team. All public health responses required in Balseskin at this time are being led by the HSE team. In line with our agreed policy with the HSE, anyone with a positive result, and their close contacts identified by contact tracing, are asked to isolate and the most appropriate setting for their needs is identified, be that on-site self-isolation or transferring to an off-site isolation facility.  The HSE makes the decision on the appropriate location based on the medical needs of the individual. </p><p>There are currently approximately 310 residents being accommodated onsite in Balseskin, which has capacity for 537 residents.

Additionally, all centres are currently closed to any visitors to protect residents and staff. As soon as the HSE advises that it is appropriate to commence inspections again, relevant officials in the Immigration Service will resume this process. During this time, to ensure that we are in regular contact with our centres, a dedicated communications team within IPAS has been established. This team undertakes daily calls with all centre managers across our network of permanent and temporary centres. Feedback from these conversations is reflected in the newsletters circulated to all centre managers to promote shared learning and best practice. The daily calls also ensure that any issues or concerns can be raised without delay for appropriate resolution for the benefit of residents and staff. In addition, residents also have the option to contact IPAS staff directly via email and can also raise concerns with the Office of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children. </p>  <p>  Inspections in our accommodation centres look at a wide range of issues such as fire safety issues, food hygiene, food quality, information provision, general security and emergency details, child protection issues, provision of TV and Wi-Fi services, staff rosters and the upkeep of all communal areas and bedrooms. Any issue identified is communicated in writing to the contractor and the contractor is required to address any issue identified immediately.  Officials from the Immigration Service follow up to ensure that relevant issues have been addressed.</p>  <p>  All accommodation centres are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website www.hpsc.ie.

By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any centre. We intend to continue this policy after the crisis. All residents over the age of 65 and those advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness have been cocooned. </p>  <p>  More specifically in relation to the Skellig Accommodation Centre in Caherciveen, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a public health situation, the response to which is being led by HSE Public Health, as is appropriate. Where cases of Covid-19 arise in the community, the HSE&rsquo;s Outbreak Control Team (OCT) manage the response. In addition to health professionals, this OCT for the centre also includes representatives from my Department and from centre management. </p>  <p>  In line with the agreed policy with the HSE, anyone from the centre with a positive COVID-19 result has been transferred to an offsite self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. The advice for the remaining residents in the Skellig Accommodation Centre to quarantine is public health advice, provided by public health authorities.  The HSE has confirmed that there should be no movement into or out of the centre at this time, unless directed by public health. The purpose of this HSE guidance is to protect the health of all residents, staff and the wider community.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 69 residents (including 9 children) onsite in the centre, which has capacity for 150 residents, and 56 bedrooms. Residents are a mix of single people and small sized families. All single residents have been offered their own bedroom and all bedrooms in the centre are en suite. Some residents have declined this offer and have indicated that they wish to self-isolate with their roommate as a family unit. We continue to encourage these residents to accept the offer of their own room at this time. </p>  <p>  Guidance has been provided by the HSE to centre management on the enhanced cleaning arrangements required at this time including through an onsite visit by a HSE infection control specialist. This applies to bedrooms, corridors, staircases, the dining room, kitchen, laundry room, lift, public toilets and reception and public areas. This is being strictly adhered to by centre management and staff. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the HSE and centre management to provide additional supports for residents during this time. There is a HSE Community Development Worker onsite at the Centre seven days a week to monitor the health of residents.  This person is supported by a wider healthcare team.  Additional outdoor space has been opened up with some seating provided and, exercise equipment has been set up in the outdoor area for residents&rsquo; use. This outdoor equipment has been installed with the knowledge and support of HSE public health, and will be operated under their direction for safe use.</p>  <p>  The residents are currently provided with three meals and snacks daily. However, in line with the overall policy objectives for accommodation centres, the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period. In the meantime, the chefs in the centre are working with the residents to find out about preferred meals and staff have been asked to source and provide ethnic snacks for residents. Kettles have been provided in rooms so that residents can make refreshments throughout the day rather than using communal facilities and meals are also being delivered to rooms. The centre has a good Wi-Fi service and phone credit has also been provided for residents so that they can keep in touch with family and friends. </p>  <p>  The current restrictions are especially difficult for children. In addition to the upgrades to the outdoor space, toys, puzzles and tablets have been being provided for children and laptops have also been provided for residents&rsquo; use. The Tusla official seconded to work with my Department to see what additional supports they need and to discuss any concerns they might have. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department began virtual clinics with residents earlier this week and a telephone support service for residents is also being established with the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my Department, the HSE and centre managers will continue to work closely together during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff of accommodation centres as a priority.</p></reply>

This consultation has been carried out to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field, so that the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective in dealing with unacceptable incidents. </p>  <p>  There has been strong engagement by the public with this topic. The Department has received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including approximately 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department has carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.  This research is currently being finalised and is expected to be published shortly. </p>  <p>  My officials are analysing all of these materials, as well as other relevant legal and policy information, to ensure that any legislative proposals which are made are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting freedom of expression. </p>  <p>  There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the approach being taken - including research and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to contribute their expertise and experience - will help to ensure that the legislation will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, including members of the LGBTI+ community, now as well as into the future.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that a Committee is being appointed to oversee the implementation of the Strategy and details of its membership will soon be announced.  In addition and in line with the commitments in the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, my Department has commenced work on a mapping of LGBTI+ community services.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.1360.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000132#WRJJ01600"><p>I can inform the Deputy  that the number of citizenship applications currently being processed is 17,954 of which 3,629 are 24 months or more in the process i.e. 20% approx.</p>  <p>  Any person may apply for Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process, providing they satisfy the statutory conditions for naturalisation.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied the applicant satisfies the statutory conditions which are that the applicant must &ndash;</p>  <p>  - Be of full age or be a minor born in the State;</p>  <p>  - Be of good character;</p>  <p>  - Have had a period of 1 year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the 8 years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to 4 years (5 years in total);</p>  <p>  - Intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and</p>  <p>  - Have made a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State and undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</p>  <p>  All applicants for a certificate of naturalisation aged 16 years and older are subject to a criminal records check carried out by the National Vetting Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This is an essential step in the process. </p>  <p>  An applicant's good character is assessed in a number of ways; including but not limited to: </p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vetting; </p>  <p>  - Home Country Police clearance; and </p>  <p>  - Adherence to the laws and regulations of the State, including regarding revenue matters. social welfare matters and in relation to driving offences. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that everyone&rsquo;s case is different, for example, many applicants provide dog licences as an indication as to their adherence to the laws of the land, whereas others provide fishing licences and permits. An increasing number of applicants provide tax clearance certificates. In fact, my Department officials and the Revenue Commissioners have collaborated on making this process easier by the provision of a Citizenship e-tax clearance selection within the drop down list on the Revenue website.  Accordingly, the good character assessment cannot be captured in a prescriptive list, rather the entirety of the case will be assessed on its own merits.  </p>  <p>  Other applicants, in addition to providing evidence of their adherence to the rules of the State, go further and provide evidence as to their active contribution to their communities. This can take many forms including letters from members of their communities relating to their involvement in their communities, e.g. volunteering on schools committees, local development committees, fund raising, volunteering in charities, faith communities, sports and social organisations, etc. These acts of active Citizenship are to be commended. However, my officials fully understand that everyone&rsquo;s circumstances are different and applicants may not be in a position to be active in their communities for various reasons. </p>  <p>  I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy would agree that the rich tapestry of a person's interactions with the State and their involvement in community life is unique to the individual and is not something that lends itself to a rigidly prescriptive list. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the next scheduled citizenship ceremony due to take place in the INEC in Killarney in July 2020 has unfortunately been postponed due to the current restrictions. I have instructed my officials to examine feasible mechanisms and processes whereby procedures such as citizenship ceremonies can take place while fully complying with the criteria outlined in the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Deputy may be aware of a challenge taken in the High Court last year by an applicant who was refused a certificate of naturalisation due to his absences from the State during the last year continuous prior to the date of his application. The outcome of this ruling &ndash; which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal &ndash; resulted in significant delays to the processing of naturalisation applications last year.</p>  <p>  The restrictions attendant to the current COVID-19 pandemic have regrettably resulted in significant challenges to the delivery of normal services. As a result of these restrictions, the   Citizenship Division of Immigration Service Delivery, along with many other public and private sector organisations is experiencing significant disruption in delivering its core functions. Working within these restrictions, public safety and the wellbeing of staff are of course both urgent priorities.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the matter is receiving ongoing attention and as soon as a practical plan is in place for the re-commencement of normal service delivery, notifications will be placed on our website (www.inis.gov.ie).  </p></reply>

In many cases where it is not possible to proceed with a wedding reception due to these restrictions, the couple and the hotel will be able to agree on an alternative date and the question of a refund will not arise.  </p><p>Where a couple have placed a deposit with a hotel or other wedding venue, they have entered into a contract with the hotel or venue concerned. Whether a couple are entitled to a refund of their deposit where it is not possible to reschedule the wedding will depend in the first instance on the terms and conditions of their contract.  Couples who find themselves in this situation should first check the terms and conditions of their contract with the hotel or venue, and in particular the terms relating to cancellations and the refund of deposits and other pre-payments. If a term of the contract provides for the refund of deposits in the event of a cancellation, the business may not subsequently change that term without the consumer&rsquo;s agreement.  While I fully appreciate that hotels are facing severe financial pressures at present, they should deal fairly with consumers who find it necessary to cancel contracts for weddings or other functions and are seeking a refund of their deposits.  </p><p>The terms of standard form contracts of the kind that typically govern weddings and other functions are subject to assessment for unfairness under the Regulations on unfair terms in consumer contracts.  The aim of the Regulations is to protect consumers against the abuse of power by sellers and suppliers, in particular by means of one-sided contract terms. The Regulations provide for example that among the terms that may be regarded as unfair are terms that permit sellers or suppliers to retain sums paid by the consumer where the latter decides not to perform the contract without providing for the consumer to receive compensation of an equivalent amount from the seller or supplier where the latter is the party cancelling the contract.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of the Regulations on the control of unfair terms in standard form consumer contracts.  Information on matters relating to consumer contracts, including on cancellations and refunds for wedding and other contracts, can be accessed on the CCPC website at <i></i>.</p><p>The enormous disruption to commercial activity caused by Covid-19 has thrown up many difficult situations for consumers and businesses. If current consumer law proves not to have provided adequate protection for consumers in these situations, I will consider and, where justified, bring forward proposals to strengthen that law where I can do so without contravening EU consumer protection legislation. Later this year I will publish the Scheme of a comprehensive, consolidated Consumer Rights Bill that will set out rights and remedies for consumer contracts for goods, services, digital content and will include proposals to strengthen the existing provisions on unfair terms in consumer contracts. This Bill will provide an opportunity to address any gaps in consumer protection revealed by the application by businesses of the terms of consumer contracts in cases arising from Covid-19. </p></reply>

The scheme was developed by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It leverages a guarantee from the European Investment Fund (EIF) and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through participating finance providers. </p>  <p>  The scheme has been well received, and as at 8 May there have been 3,502 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 3,327 have been approved. The strong uptake of the scheme has meant that the initial funding of &euro;300m has now been almost fully subscribed. To date, 1,045 applicants have progressed to sanction under the scheme. </p>  <p>  On 8 April, I announced a &euro;200 million expansion to the scheme.</p>  <p>  The FGLS is underpinned by a 64% counter-guarantee from the European Investment Fund. This counter-guarantee provides significant risk protection to the Exchequer against potential losses from the loan guarantee scheme.  The FGLS was established using the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018. This Act allows for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into agreements with the European Investment Fund (EIF) to facilitate access to finance for qualifying enterprises. </p>  <p>  There is a limit of &euro;75 million set out in the Act on the total value of agreements (for First Loss payments) that the relevant Ministers can enter into with the EIF. Capacity currently remains within the aggregate limit set out in the Act to allow for an agreement with the EIF in relation to the planned &euro;200m expansion of the FGLS. Officials of my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance, and the SBCI are working to ensure this is available as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  However, the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group recently announced, as part of the European Union response to COVID-19, that it would be providing &euro;25 billion in guarantees to underpin &euro;200 billion in funding for member States to mitigate against COVID-19. For Ireland to be able to enter into additional agreements with the EIF, so as to leverage these EIB guarantees, will require an amendment to the aggregate limit set out in the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018.</p>  <p>  So, while there is no legislation required to allow the pillar banks to issue loans under the Future Growth Loan Scheme, legislation changes would be required for further expansions of the FGLS beyond that which I have already announced.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have been working urgently alongside the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting of legislation to amend the aggregate limit for agreements within the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018. The intention is that it will be progressed through the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency once a new Government is formed.</p></reply>

For Ireland to be able to enter into additional agreements with the EIF, so as to leverage these EIB guarantees, will require an amendment to the aggregate limit set out in the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have been working urgently alongside the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting of legislation to amend the aggregate limit for agreements within the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018. The intention is that it will be progressed through the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency once a new Government is formed.</p></reply>

The Protocol is a living document which will evolve with changing  with Public Health advice.</p><p>Under the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, the HSA has full powers to oversee compliance with the health, safety and wellbeing of workers in their place of work.  While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through human contact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.  Neither health, safety nor welfare are narrowly defined in the 2005 Act, so the HSA has all of the powers that it needs.</p><p>Section 27 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 prohibits an employer from penalising or threatening to penalise an employee with respect to any terms or condition of his/her employment, where the employee is exercising any right under safety and health legislation. The enforcement of the Section 27 of the Health and Safety Act is a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>In relation to the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) this body does not have legal enforcement powers in relation to occupational safety and health. However, the NSAI has developed very useful guidance for businesses in the context of operating safely taking account of the range of COVID-19 public health measures. The NSAI has published three guidance documents;</p><p>- COVID-19 Workplace Protection and Improvement Guide</p><p>- COVID-19 Retail Protection and Improvement Guide</p><p>- Guidance on Manufacturing and Importing PPE and Medical Devices</p><p>Further sectoral guidance will be considered as the Roadmap progresses. Separately, the Health and Safety Authority is currently preparing to publish a range of follow-on supports for businesses/employers as well as workers/worker representatives. These include:</p><p>- Checklist for Employers with details on control measures, induction etc.</p><p>- Checklist for workers</p><p>- Checklist for Worker Representative</p><p>- Templates for Return to Work Form/Covid Response Plan</p><p>Phase 1 of the reopening of the economy began on Monday last and, the HSA and other inspectors are out there advising and guiding employers on how to respect the Protocol.  Helping businesses to comply is the overall goal of the HSA.  However if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved</p></reply>

The study examined the implications of Brexit for the Irish economy and trade, quantifying the impact of possible new barriers to trade which might emerge as a result of Brexit. </p><p>The study also provided analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy. Five sectors were identified that account for 90% of the impact and these are: Agri-food, Pharma-chemicals, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Air Transport. The rise of non-tariff barriers due to regulatory divergence is the main factor driving the results as opposed to the imposition of the tariff regimes of the EU and the UK on their respective imports/goods.</p><p>This analysis was undertaken on the basis of no policy action being taken although this of course is not the case given the extensive Brexit mitigation actions put in place across Government and across all sectors of the economy in the past few years. </p><p>All of the scenarios examined in the 2018 study produce a result that is less favourable than a non-Brexit scenario. The scenarios considered reflected four of the possible outcomes from the future relationship between the EU and the UK &ndash; an EEA scenario, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a Customs Union, or a worst-case, no trade deal, WTO scenario. </p><p>The WTO scenario was found to have the most negative impact on the Irish economy gradually reducing GDP growth by 7% by 2030; an EEA scenario would be least damaging gradually reducing GDP growth by 2.8% by 2030. The study found that regardless of the scenario modelled, the Irish economy was still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030. Brexit would have a dampening impact, however, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. </p><p>Following the adoption of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Revised Political Declaration (RPD) on the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK last year, my Department undertook further Brexit analysis with Copenhagen Economics. Under this latest study, two additional scenarios for a Free Trade Agreement were examined to take account of the provisions of the RPD published in January 2020. This latest study is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie.  </p><p>Overall, the findings from this study suggest that a Brexit outcome based on the RPD is likely to reduce Irish GDP by between 3.2% and 3.9% by 2030 compared with a baseline where the UK remains a member of the EU. This compares to a negative impact of 7% in the no deal (WTO basis) modelled in the previous Copenhagen Economics study.</p><p>In response to the various Brexit analysis and studies undertaken across Government I have, over the course of the last three budgets put in place through the enterprise agencies, an extensive suite of enterprise supports to assist businesses to meet the challenges presented by Brexit. They range from liquidity support through short-term and long-term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties. The majority of enterprise supports are open to all businesses, including SMEs, and not just those that are clients of the enterprise agencies.</p><p>Of course most recently businesses have been beset by the huge challenges that COVID-19 has brought about. Government has responded swiftly by making available a myriad of supports to help businesses deal with the crisis presented by this pandemic. </p><p>As we begin the phased reopening of the economy this week in line with the Government's COVID-19 recovery plan, I am acutely aware too that businesses must not lose sight of the Brexit-related challenges that remain. This is particularly highlighted by the challenging negotiations that are currently ongoing between the EU and the UK to reach an agreement on the future trading relationship, and the ever-present danger of a no trade deal scenario. </p><p>As our economy recovers post the Covid-19 pandemic, I encourage businesses more than ever to avail of the Government supports that are widely available. Full details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.dbei.gov.ie</i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.1447.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000133#WRKK02300"><p>The issues businesses are facing in respect of commercial rents / leases have been raised with me through the Enterprise Forum and Retail Forum, both of which I chair, and other channels.</p><p>These are difficult times and many companies have had to temporarily close their businesses and/or premise(s), curtail their activities or make alternative work arrangements due to COVID-19 restrictions. I am keenly aware that some businesses, particularly in the retail sector, are concerned that some landlords are continuing to insist on the payment of rents and leases as normal despite their premises being closed.</p><p>At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance or security costs, that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank/lender will accept. The Minister for Finance raised the broader issue of rents in meetings with the pillar banks. He referenced this in his announcement of 18 March concerning an arrangement with the banks to the effect that any landlord who has agreed a deal with the banks on foot of the arrangement will be expected to pass the benefit on to their tenants. I reiterated this in the D&aacute;il on 30 April last.</p><p>While commercial leases are primarily a contractual matter for the tenant and the landlord, the Government has urged landlords to demonstrate forbearance in these extraordinary times and to play their part, as everyone must, in helping the country through this difficult period. I would encourage tenants and landlords to engage with each other on this matter and come to some arrangement as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed.</p><p>I have asked my officials to raise the matter of commercial rents and leases across a number of Government Departments. An initial inter-departmental discussion has already taken place and I understand further engagement is underway with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.</p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants. </p><p>The matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents has been raised with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed by Government. I have just received a response in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. The difficulties stem from a variety of legal bases including statutory, constitutional, contract and common law. I have asked my officials to consider the advice.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. I would like to point out that, on 2 May, the Government announced an additional suite of measures to further support small, medium and larger business that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. These included:</p><p>-A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver/rebate from 2019;</p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates; </p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms; and</p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.</p><p>These supports acknowledge that impacted businesses need time and space to restructure and resume activity, without the added pressures of trying to repay legacy debts, such as commercial rents, when revenues are just beginning to return.</p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at <i>www.gov.ie</i>or on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i></i>).</p></reply>

In April of this year I increased support for two online trading initiatives to a total of &euro;7.6m &ndash; the first for micro enterprises in partnership with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Richard Bruton TD, and the second for retailers with 10 or more employees.</p><p>Firstly, in conjunction with Minister Bruton's Department of Climate Action and the Environment, I have increased support for the Trading Online Voucher Scheme which is available to all micro enterprises with less than 10 employees, including those in the retail sector through the Local Enterprise Office network nationwide. The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Vouchers are a key government grant to help small and micro enterprises, with very limited or no e-commerce presence, to get online, boost their sales and reach new markets &ndash; particularly during this difficult period, when so many small businesses are closed to the public. However, the value of the Trading Online Voucher will stand to businesses for years to come, boosting revenue, and helping sustain and create jobs into the future. </p><p>The Voucher can be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to websites or developing new apps for customers, with co-funding from the business currently set at just 10 percent. The Voucher can also be used towards subscriptions to low-cost online retail platform solutions to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online. Training and further business supports are also provided along with the Scheme.</p><p>Flexibilities to the Trading Online Voucher scheme  are now in place allowing businesses apply for a second voucher where they have successfully utilised their first one, which brings the overall total voucher amount available up to &euro;5,000 for each eligible business.  </p><p>To qualify for the scheme, businesses must have:</p><p>- limited or no e-commerce presence</p><p>- no more than 10 employees;</p><p>- less than &euro;2m in turnover; </p><p>- be trading for at least 6 months and </p><p>- be located in the region of the local enterprise office to whom they are applying (additional T&amp;amp;Cs apply)</p><p>Further details about the expanding Trading Online Voucher Scheme are available at <i></i></p><p>The Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme is complementary to the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) Trading Online Voucher Scheme. The objective of the Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector which have started an online journey, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. </p><p>My Department proposed this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must employ 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. </p><p>This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way.  The total fund size will be up to &euro;2 million under this call. Further details on this Scheme available at </p><p>I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness.</p></reply>

This fund for smaller businesses provides &euro;25,000 and &euro;50,000 in repayable advances, depending on size and turnover of company. This fund will provide liquidity to enable these enterprises to steer a pathway towards recovery and to introduce measures in response to the controls and health and safety requirements in line with changing work patterns and protocols and guidelines being introduced as we begin the re-opening of the economy. </p>  <p>  On 15 May last, the Government also agreed the arrangements for the new &euro;250m &ldquo;Restart Grant&rdquo; for micro enterprises and small businesses.  The "Restart Grant" is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. It will be a critically important tool to support small businesses to reopen their doors and get back on their feet. This grant will enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business. </p>  <p>  The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  Applications for the "Restart Grant" can be made online to all local authorities from Friday 22 May.</p>  <p>  In addition to the extensive package of liquidity measures announced, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p>  <p>  In line with its statutory responsibility to enforce specific consumer protection legislative provisions, officers from the CCPC have been monitoring pricing compliance in both online and on-premises retail markets within three areas:</p>  <p>  1. Trader obligations under S.I. No. 639 of 2002, European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations. </p>  <p>  2. Trader obligations under S.I. No. 484 of 2013 European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations.</p>  <p>  3. Trader obligations under The Consumer Protection Act 2007.</p>  <p>  The provisions outlined above are primarily concerned with ensuring that products are properly priced in accordance with the regulations and that consumers are not being misled by being charged more for a product than the advertised price. </p>  <p>  In the course of our monitoring activities we have conducted 110 store visits and 730 spot price checks on a range of consumer products. Our information to date would indicate that compliance levels with the obligations referred to above are currently not a cause for concern. Monitoring activities in that respect will continue.</p>  <p>  With respect to emerging trends, the number of contacts received by the CCPC from the general public relating to concerns about price increases and product availability have been very low. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19.  In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable under the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p></reply>

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.</p>  <p>  The Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists are subject to twice-yearly review which is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process and involves consideration of the research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  Submissions to the review process are also considered by the Economic Migration Policy Interdepartmental Group chaired by this Department and which includes the Department of Health. A review of the lists is currently underway and is expected to be finalised before the end of June 2020.</p>  <p>  The Employment Permits system has an important role in ensuring that key medical staff are available for our health services at this critical juncture as the country tackles this emerging situation. As a result, my Department has been prioritising the processing of employment permit applications for medical personnel and these applications continue to be prioritised. I have also facilitated the access of diploma qualified nurses and radiographers to Critical Skills Employment Permits and made improvements in the assignment of work permits to doctors on rotation. </p>  <p>  Since mid-March 1,404 employment permits have been granted to medical personnel, comprising 745 permits for Nurses, 642 permits for Doctors and 17 permits for Radiographers. Some occupations such as Healthcare Assistants are currently on the Ineligible Occupations List and, following the completion of the most recent review in December 2019, were not proposed for amendment at that time.</p>  <p>  In light of the COVID-19 crisis and following the submission of a new business case from Nursing Home representatives regarding the removal of healthcare assistants from the ineligible occupation list, discussions have commenced  between officials of my Department and the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  I also understand that the Department of Health and HSE are engaging with the private and voluntary nursing homes sector, in the context of addressing the COVID 19 emergency. In addition, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has rolled out a scheme to increase national take up of newly emerging employment opportunities. In light of this, I am advised that it was agreed that a change to the employment permits lists in this regard would not be pursued at this time but may however be revisited at a later date. </p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15 May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday 18 May. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can re-open under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie.</p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate.</p><p>The Protocol is available at </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or <i>wcu@hsa.ie</i>.</p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>On 8 May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30 June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000. </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country, I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to flex the plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.</p></reply>

The Government remained poised to react swiftly to the developing landscape for enterprises and will continue to keep the supports provided for enterprise under review.</p><p><b>Table 1: Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme uptake by business size:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of Employees </th>       <th>Number of Loans </th>       <th>Value of Loans</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Less than 10</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>&euro;7,176,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11 - 50</td>       <td>46</td>       <td>&euro;8,384,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>51-250</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>&euro;5,700,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>133</td>       <td>&euro;21,260,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Table 1 provides details of the first &euro;21.26m of loans progressed to sanction under this scheme, sorted by the size of the applicant businesses.</p><p><b>Table 2: Future Growth Loan Scheme uptake by business size:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of Employees </th>       <th>Number of Loans </th>       <th>Value of Loans</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Less than 10</td>       <td>720</td>       <td>&euro;116,243,376</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11 - 49</td>       <td>271</td>       <td>&euro;79,859,660</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>50-249*</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>&euro;25,840,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>1043</td>       <td>&euro;221,943,536</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Table 2 provides details of the first &euro;222m of loans progressed to sanction under this scheme, sorted by the size of the applicant businesses.</p><p>*Please note that the number of businesses of more than 250 employees that have benefitted from the scheme is small and these have been included in the category of businesses with 50-249 employees to avoid any potential confidentiality issues.</p><p><b></b>Note: The employment data in the table above for EI supports is based on the Annual Employment Survey 2019.

The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. </p><p>It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following my further announcement on April 8 this Scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250 million in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450 million.</p><p>The scheme features a two-stage application process. Businesses must first confirm their eligibility with the SBCI. Successful applicants will be issued an eligibility reference number, which they can then use to apply for a loan with one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures. </p><p>Up to 10 May, there has been a total of 2,118 applications received to the COVID-19 WCS, of which 2,017 candidates were eligible, 13 ineligible and 88 applications are currently in process.

Given the cost burden to businesses even with these subsidised rates of interest I decided to apply a substantial reduction in the interest rate to 4.5% on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI.  This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.</p>  <p>  As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan.</p>  <p>  The types of businesses normally supported, if they could obtain unsecured bank funding, would normally attract a significantly higher rate of interest due to the unsecured nature of this lending and the inherent risk.  Microfinance Ireland is a not-for-profit lender and is loss making due to the nature of the risk it is mandated to take.  </p>  <p>  There were 484 applications received under the Microfinance Ireland loan scheme from the 19 March 2020 up to 13 May 2020.  There were 283 applications approved for a value of &euro;7,985,762 and 103 applications deemed ineligible/declined.  The remainder of applications are in progress within MFI's application process.</p></reply>

The Health and Safety Authority will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p>  <p>  The Protocol provides that within the workplace every employer will prepare a COVID-19 specific Response Plan and appoint at least one lead COVID-19 worker representative. The Protocol also provides that this Plan will be developed in consultation with workers. Existing safety representatives in the workplace appointed under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, can play a valuable role in this regard. I am satisfied that this approach will ensure the necessary collaboration and co-operation between employers and employees who share the common goal of keeping workplaces safe.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the reopening of the economy began on Monday last and, as I said at the time, the HSA and other inspectors are out there advising and guiding employers on how to respect the Protocol.  Helping businesses to comply is the overall goal of the HSA.  However if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved.</p>  <p>  A high-level consultative stakeholder forum, under the aegis of LEEF, has been established to oversee the implementation of the Protocol as the economy opens up, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap.  The forum will include membership from the various bodies with responsibility for health and safety at work, and for public health more generally.</p></reply>

This now includes a specific fund for smaller businesses of &euro;25,000 and &euro;50,000, depending on size and turnover of company.  This fund will be operated by Enterprise Ireland and provide liquidity to enable these enterprises to steer a pathway towards recovery and to introduce measures in response to the controls and health and safety requirements in line with changing work patterns and protocols and guidelines being introduced as we begin the re-opening of the economy.</p>  <p>  These supports together with the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness.</p>  <p>  On Friday 15 May last, the Government agreed the arrangements for the new &euro;250m &ldquo;Restart Grant&rdquo; for micro enterprises and small businesses.  The Restart Grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. Eligible businesses will receive a Restart Grant equivalent to their commercial rates assessment for 2019 (excluding arrears), subject to a minimum grant of &euro;2,000 and a maximum of &euro;10,000. This grant will provide funding to enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19.  In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable under the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15th May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18th. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at <i></i>. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or <i>wcu@hsa.ie</i>. </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. </p><p>On 8th May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30th June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.</p><p>For a full list of supports for business please see<i></i>. </p><p>These supports were developed and put in place in light of feedback I received while engaging with businesses. Since this crisis began, I have convened numerous meetings of the Enterprise and Retail forums, which I chair, and met other representatives of employers and employees and the response back has been very positive. I will continue to maintain that dialogue with stakeholders, including representatives of the hairdressing sector, so that we can work towards getting people back to work safely.</p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country. I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to amends its plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources. </p><p>In my view, circumventing current restrictions represents a willful act which increases the risk of spreading COVID-19 and undermines our ambitions to protect our people and our economy by unwinding restrictions safely.  Addressing the shadow economy is an important part of ensuring fairness and a level playing field for all businesses and workers in our economy, especially at a time when we are trying to ensure that we can safely and gradually return to work and productivity.  While the Workplace  Relations Commission (WRC) works with the Department of Employment and Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to address the challenges posed by the shadow economy, the Revenue Commissioners lead in this matter and further information in this regard is available at<i> </i></p></reply>

In current circumstances where the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 Travel Advisory advises &lsquo;against all non-essential travel overseas until further notice&rsquo; and where restrictions on entry by non-nationals into other countries are widely in force, it can be taken that such unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances apply generally. </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection is responsible for the enforcement of section 18A of the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act 1995.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation has responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the insolvency protection provisions of the 1995 Act and related enactments, principally the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act 1982. As the 1995 Act and these related enactments were enacted on the basis of Bills initiated, or Statutory Instruments signed, by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Transport, Tourism has the lead role for consumer protection in the package travel area.</p></reply>

I can assure the workers impacted that there are Government supports in place to help them through this time. Neither I nor my Department has had contact with the management of Debenhams.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the High Court has appointed joint liquidators of Debenhams Retail (Ireland) Limited. In this context, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have no statutory power to intervene in a court-supervised liquidation.  The liquidation process in this instance will be subject to oversight of the High Court.</p>  <p>  My Department has agreed a Job Loss Response Protocol with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will lead on this.  The protocol puts in place all the efforts to assist the workers. It includes welfare entitlements, job-search assistance and upskilling needs/opportunities.</p>  <p>  My colleague Minister Regina Doherty and her Department, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility for providing support for the workers who have unfortunately lost their jobs due to the closure of the Debenhams Irish stores. </p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment is available for all persons who have become unemployed as a result of COVID-19 and is also payable with redundancy. Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and Benefit are also options for financial aid for those persons now unemployed as a result of the closure of Debenhams Irish stores. </p>  <p>  In the case of any concession staff who are self-employed, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment applies if their trading income has collapsed to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time employment if it is offered to them. If a person subsequently applies for Jobseekers Benefit Self-Employed, that claim will be considered separately under the rules of that Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation and continues to be fully operational and available to any interested parties who may require it.  If employees of Debenhams have concerns or complaints regarding their employment rights the Customer Service Section of the WRC provides information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, and how to obtain redress where appropriate.</p></reply>

Costs may include ongoing operational fixed costs, stock depreciation, opportunity costs in terms of declining revenues, costs associated with preparing workplaces to align with public health and physical distancing guidelines, and so forth. There are also of course human costs associated with the letting go of staff and reduced social contact. </p>  <p>  These costs, and other impacts, will be contingent on the particular situation for every business and will be influenced by factors such as sectoral dimensions; the relevance and impact of current restrictions; the relevant phasing in the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business; the adaptations made by the business, for example using e-commerce channels; the uptake of available supports; and available sub-supply and customer demand. </p>  <p>  With so many variables, and the challenges of having timely data for same across the breadth of the enterprise base, monthly estimates are not available.</p>  <p>  Considering the Stability Programme Update (SPU) published recently by the Department of Finance, and notwithstanding that there is a huge degree of uncertainty, it is clear that the economy has suffered a severe shock without historical precedent. Under the Department&rsquo;s central scenario, GDP is projected to decline by over 10% in 2020. Some 220,000 jobs will be lost with the unemployment rate exceeding 25% in the second quarter of the year. Based on the analysis in the SPU and other detailed sectoral and labour market analysis it is clear that as of now the most-heavily impacted sectors are accommodation and food, construction, and other personal services.  Other sectors where the impacts are significant but somewhat less severe include the manufacturing sector, administrative and support services, wholesale and retail trade and transport and storage. This pattern of sectoral impacts is similar to that observed in other countries. Sector where remote working is not feasible or that rely on personal contact with consumers are hugely exposed to the necessary travel and other restrictions that containment of the virus requires.</p>  <p>  The phased reopening of the economy will see a slow return to economic activity although it is anticipated that it will take considerable time before the economy returns to the levels which pertained prior to COVID-19. Therefore, the Government will continue to focus on assisting the enterprise sector through financial and advisory supports as well as continuing to develop new measures which help address the particular challenges across enterprise sectors as they arise and as sectors reopen.</p></reply>

The scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. </p>  <p>  It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following my further announcement on April 8 this Scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250 million in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this Scheme to &euro;450 million.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) negatively impacted by Covid-19. Loans under the Scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m and are for periods of up to three years. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. </p>  <p>  The Scheme features a two-stage application process. Businesses must first confirm their eligibility with the SBCI. Successful applicants will be issued an eligibility reference number, which they can then use to apply for a loan with one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures. </p>  <p>  Up to 4th May, there has been a total of 2,127 applications received to the COVID-19 WCS, of which 1,834 candidates were eligible, 9 ineligible and 284 applications are currently in process. Of the total approved, 299 were from food businesses. Of those sanctioned loans, 24 were to food businesses to a total value of &euro;3.2m.</p>  <p>  As expected, there is lag in seeing the volume of eligibility applications being translated into loan approvals. This is because the eligibility application and the loan approval are sequential, and there is due diligence required in assessing loans which does take time. However, the ramp up in loans being processed is now becoming more visible with 100 of the 156 loans approved under this scheme approved in the two weeks up to 4th May. </p></reply>

My Department  developed this scheme in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>Finance provided under the scheme is competitively priced and offered at favourable terms, for example no security required for loans up to &euro;500,000. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019 across all sectors and regions including in exporting businesses and family businesses.</p><p>The FGLS features a two-stage application process. Applicants must first confirm their eligibility under the scheme with the SBCI. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful candidates are issued an eligibility reference number.</p><p>Businesses can then use this number to apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.</p><p>Up to 4 May, there has been a total of 3,449 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 3,286 have been approved for eligibility under the scheme. To date, 1043 loans have progressed to sanction to a total value of &euro;222m (with further loans in the pipeline for sanctioning at one of the lenders).</p><p>The initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses. On 8 April, I announced a further expansion of this scheme and my Department is now working through the details of a significant expansion to bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>The table below provides details of eligibility applications and loans progressed to sanction under this scheme by farmers and food businesses up to 4 May 2020.

The Health and Safety Authority will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p>  <p>  The Protocol provides that within the workplace every employer will prepare a COVID-19 specific Response Plan and appoint at least one lead COVID-19 worker representative. The Protocol also provides that this Plan will be developed in consultation with workers. Existing safety representatives in the workplace appointed under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, can play a valuable role in this regard. I am satisfied that this approach will ensure the necessary collaboration and co-operation between employers and employees who share the common goal of keeping workplaces safe.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the reopening of the economy began on Monday last and, the HSA and other inspectors are out there advising and guiding employers on how to respect the Protocol.  Helping businesses to comply is the overall goal of the HSA.  However if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the Protocol gives employers and employees the practical tools to re-open businesses, return to work safely and to operate in a safe manner as the phased re-opening of our economy kicks in in the months ahead.</p></reply>

While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through human contact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.  Neither health, safety nor welfare are narrowly defined in the 2005 Act, so the HSA has all of the powers that it needs.</p>  <p>  As we have seen with the general public health measures that we have all been asked to observe, most people are complying with the rules. We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings. I am expecting employers and workers, in line with what is set out in the Protocol, to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying the clear measures set out in the Protocol, for the health and safety of all concerned. The HSA inspectors cannot be expected to go into every business in the country. That would be entirely unrealistic and unachievable. What they will do is a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSA Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline. If, following contact from a worker, and engagement with the employer, they feel that an inspection is warranted, they will follow up with an on-site visit. However if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved.</p></reply>

Some of these are involved in the management and scheduling of inspections, and others are involved in carrying out a range statutory activity including market surveillance of products (including PPE) and chemicals and investigations into workplace fatalities and accidents, so not all of these inspectors can be deployed in the field at the same time. However, the HSA is currently deploying all its available inspectors across sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol.  The HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities.  While details such as Service Level Agreements etc. are currently being finalised, I can say that the numbers of additional resources working with the HSA will be in the hundreds, from across the system.  These will be specialist officials who already have sectoral business inspection or monitoring responsibilities.  Compliance with the Covid Return to Work Safely Protocol will become part of their normal inspection regime.  It will start shortly with some 200 or so officers from the Environmental Health Service, and this number will increase steadily as officials from other parts of the system, with varying sectoral inspection and oversight responsibilities are brought on board, in line with the Government Roadmap.  I can assure you that the Government will not be found wanting in resourcing this important work.</p><p>As we have seen with the general public health measures over the past two months, most people are complying with the rules. We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings.</p><p>I am expecting employers and workers, in line with what is set out in the Protocol, to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying the clear measures set out in the Protocol, for the health and safety of all concerned.</p><p>Even with the enhanced cohort of inspectors available to the HSA, they cannot be expected to go into every business in the country. That would be entirely unrealistic and unachievable. What they will do is a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSA Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline. <i>wcu@hsa.ie</i>and Tel: 1890 289 389.</p><p>Information on the current resources of the Health and Safety Authority is attached in tabular form.</p></reply>

Free mentoring and online training are also available for all SMEs. This package is a significant step-up in the supports available for all businesses in all sectors at this very difficult time. The measures have been developed to meet the varying needs of Irish enterprise and they are very specifically targeted by size, sector and need.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new package of liquidity measures I announced are detailed below, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p>  <p>   In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p>  <p>  The key measures which constitute the &euro;1 billion in liquidity measures as I announced are set out below. </p>  <p>  The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme was announced on 11 March and opened for eligibility applications on 23 March. The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following my further announcement on April 8 this Scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250 million in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450 million.</p>  <p>  Up to 4 May, there has been a total of 2,127 applications received to the COVID-19 WCS, of which 1,834 candidates were eligible, 9 ineligible and 284 applications are currently in process. Of those, 156 loans have progressed to sanction to a total value of &euro;28.02m.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) though participating lenders. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019 across all sectors and regions including in exporting businesses and family businesses.</p>  <p>  Up to 4 May, there has been a total of 3,449 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 3,286 have been approved for eligibility under the scheme. The initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses. On 8 April, I announced a further expansion of this scheme and my Department is now working through the details of a significant expansion to bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  A new &euro;2,500 Business Continuity Voucher is available through Local Enterprise Offices and is designed for businesses across every sector that employ up to 50 people. It can be used by companies to develop short-term and long-term strategies to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the &euro;150m of funding capacity in the Government&rsquo;s Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p>  <p>  For microenterprises (under 10 employees) and businesses with over 10 employees, Microfinance Ireland (MFI) are administering special COVID-19 Loans, with an additional &euro;13m in capital support bringing its total lending capacity up to &euro;20m for the coming period. There is also a substantial reduction in interest rates on these loans from 7.8% to 4.5%. Loans can be made up to &euro;50,000 with no repayments required and no interest charged in the first six months.</p>  <p>  The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher Scheme for microenterprises is being expanded - an additional &euro;3.3m is being provided to the scheme bringing the total available to &euro;5.6m. The scheme is also being made more flexible - allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one; and allowing subscriptions to low-cost online retailing platform solutions to quickly establish a retailing presence online.</p>  <p>  The &euro;180m Sustaining Enterprise Fund is specifically aimed at all firms with 10 or more employees in the manufacturing and international services sectors impacted by COVID-19 that are vulnerable but viable. The Fund will be operated by Enterprise Ireland, providing repayable advances of up to &euro;800,000 as agreed with the EU under new State Aid rules and, together with leveraged lending from the financial markets, should see up to &euro;500m of additional investment in vulnerable but viable firms. These grants will only be repayable if and when a business returns to financial good health.</p>  <p>  A Business Financial Planning Grant from Enterprise Ireland to the value of &euro;5,000 to assist companies to develop a Business Sustainment Plan and to engage the services of an approved Financial Consultant.</p>  <p>  A new &euro;2,500 LEAN Business Improvement Grant from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to help companies quickly access expertise to review and optimise operations at a time of crisis and identify the key measures needed to ensure continued viability.</p>  <p>  A new &euro;2m Online Retail Scheme from Enterprise Ireland will be open to retailers employing over 10 people. The objective of the Scheme is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand for a competitive online offer. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. </p>  <p>   On Saturday 2 May last, I also announced a further suite of measures to support small, medium and larger business that are negatively impacted by Covid-19 with Minister Paschal Donohoe, T.D., Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and Minister Eoghan Murphy, T.D.,  Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. This package of support followed the publication of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business, which sets out a five-stage plan to ease the Covid-19 restrictions and reopen Ireland&rsquo;s economy and society. The new measures we announced included:</p>  <p>  - A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates/waiver rebate from 2019;</p>  <p>  - A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms;</p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;</p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt; and,</p>  <p>  - A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue provide full services to the public.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Shane Ross T.D., Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport may be able to provide more specific guidelines or supports designed to suit private bus operators.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.1607.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000135#WRMM03400"><p>The issues businesses are facing in respect of commercial rents/leases have been raised with me through the Enterprise Forum and Retail Forum, both of which I chair, and other channels.</p><p>These are difficult times and many companies have had to temporarily close their businesses and/or premise(s), curtail their activities or make alternative work arrangements due to COVID-19 restrictions. I am keenly aware that some businesses, particularly in the retail sector, are concerned that some landlords are continuing to insist on the payment of rents and leases as normal despite their premises being closed.</p><p>At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance or security costs, that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank / lender will accept. The Minister for Finance raised the broader issue of rents in meetings with the pillar banks. He referenced this in his announcement of 18<sup>th</sup>March concerning an arrangement with the banks to the effect that any landlord who has agreed a deal with the banks on foot of the arrangement will be expected to pass the benefit on to their tenants. I reiterated this in the D&aacute;il on 30<sup>th</sup>April last.</p><p>While commercial leases are primarily a contractual matter for the tenant and the landlord, the Government has urged landlords to demonstrate forbearance in these extraordinary times and to play their part, as everyone must, in helping the country through this difficult period. I would encourage tenants and landlords to engage with each other on this matter and come to some arrangement as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed.</p><p>I have asked my officials to raise the matter of commercial rents and leases across a number of Government Departments. An initial inter-departmental discussion has already taken place and I understand further engagement is underway with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.</p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants. </p><p>The matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents has been raised with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed by Government. I have just received a response in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. The difficulties stem from a variety of legal bases including statutory, constitutional, contract and common law. I have asked my officials to consider the advice.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. I would like to point out that, on 2<sup>nd</sup>May, the Government announced an additional suite of measures to further support small, medium and larger business that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. These included:</p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver/rebate from 2019;</p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates; - A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms; and</p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.</p><p>These supports acknowledge that impacted businesses need time and space to restructure and resume activity, without the added pressures of trying to repay legacy debts, such as commercial rents, when revenues are just beginning to return.</p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at <i>www.gov.ie</i>or on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i></i>).</p></reply>

While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through human contact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.  Neither health, safety nor welfare are narrowly defined in the 2005 Act, so the HSA has all of the powers that it needs.</p>  <p>  The HSA is deploying all its available inspectors across sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol.  The HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities.  As we have seen with the general public health measures over the past two months, most people are complying with the rules. We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings.</p>  <p>  I am expecting employers and workers, in line with what is set out in the Protocol, to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying the clear measures set out in the Protocol, for the health and safety of all concerned.</p>  <p>  Even with the enhanced cohort of inspectors available to the HSA, they cannot be expected to go into every business in the country. That would be entirely unrealistic and unachievable. What they will do is a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSAs Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline. </p>  <p>  If, following contact from a worker, and follow-up engagement with the employer, they feel that an inspection is warranted, they will follow up with an on-site visit.  </p>  <p>  Importantly, if, on foot of an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action - up to and including the closure of a workplace - will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved.</p></reply>

Of necessity, the legislation and the scheme itself were developed very quickly to support the urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees that have been seriously affected by the pandemic.  </p><p>The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself simply cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees.</p><p>The core principles of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash; </p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p><p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020.</p><p>The changes to Revenue&rsquo;s systems required to fully implement the TWSS have been delivered incrementally since the scheme commenced on 26 March 2020. The latest phase of the scheme implements the revised subsidy rates, as determined by the Minister for Finance, in accordance with the legislation and is effective from 4 May 2020 for most employees. This phase is based on providing employers with details of the maximum personal subsidy amount to be paid to individual employees based on their previous average net weekly pay.</p><p>On 15 April 2020, the Minister for Finance announced further updates to the TWSS. Included in the updates were measures to increase the wage subsidy for certain lower paid employees.  In effect, for those employees with previous net pay of less than &euro;586 per week, the amount of the temporary wage subsidy shall not exceed &euro;410 per week in accordance with the following principles:</p><p>- an 85% subsidy shall be payable in the case of employees whose average net weekly pay does not exceed &euro;412; and </p><p>- a flat rate subsidy of up to &euro;350 shall be payable in the case of employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;412 but not more than &euro;500.</p><p>In addition, where an employer wishes to pay a greater level of top-up, in respect of employees with net pay of less than &euro;412 per week, in order to bring the employee&rsquo;s pay to &euro;350 per week, then tapering would not be applied to the subsidy.</p><p>These changes to the TWSS mean that more employees will now receive a subsidy of &euro;350 per week, and those with previous net pay below &euro;412 per week will now receive a greater level of subsidy. </p><p>These new rates have been fully operational for payroll submissions made on or after 4 May 2020, with a pay date on or after that same date.  </p><p>The changes announced allow the concentration of resources to protect incomes, in a proportionate way having regard to available resources, employer contribution and the broader suite of COVID-19 related supports put in place by the Government.</p><p>Currently, the Minister for Finance has no plans to change the average wage calculation to a different period.</p></reply>

The timeline for the resumption of work remains dependent on  public health advice and the facility&rsquo;s completion date will be revised accordingly.</p>  <p>  In addition to the RPP, the IDA continues to target further investment for Monaghan and the wider region through its regional office in neighbouring Cavan. As part of its strategy to promote the area, the IDA is focusing on the specific sectors of agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The Agency's staff regularly engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Monaghan - including local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base and the indigenous sector - as part of efforts to generate new investment. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the level of foreign direct investment in County Monaghan continues to improve. From 2017 to 2019, Monaghan reported a twofold increase in employment by IDA Ireland client companies with 168 net new jobs added during this period. I am confident that the new ATU in Knockaconny will stimulate further investment and job creation for the people of Monaghan and the wider Border region. </p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15<sup>th</sup>May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18<sup>th</sup>. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can re-open under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie.</p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate.</p><p>The Protocol is available at  <i></i></p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or <i>wcu@hsa.ie</i>.</p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see <i></i>. </p><p>On 8<sup>th</sup>May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000. </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country, I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to flex the plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.</p></reply>

I have been assured that the CIF operating procedure report has been amended to fully reflect the occupational health and safety actions required by the Return to Work Safely Protocol. I welcome the level of detail in the CIF operating procedure document which is specific to the construction sector and covers the use of vehicles in the sector. </p>  <p>  My expectation is that employers and workers, in line with what is set out in the Protocol, to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying the clear measures set out in the Protocol to ensure the health and safety of all concerned is protected.</p></reply>

the increasingly complex environment within which the ODCE operates.  </p><p>That restructuring has included the seeking of sanction for the recruitment of a substantial number of additional professional staff, and following receipt of sanction, the recruitment of eight accounting professionals (one of whom was promoted to Enforcement Portfolio Manager), two Enforcement Portfolio Managers and a Digital Forensics Specialist, together with significant investment in a digital forensics laboratory, training and development. The recruitment and assimilation of a large number of new professional staff into a multi-disciplinary organisation that undertakes complex work in a fast-moving environment is a project that requires careful management. As such, the Director is of the view that it is preferable to allow that process to fully bed down before filling the Corporate Compliance manager vacancy. The Director is further conscious of the fact that the transition of the ODCE to an independent Agency will give rise to additional expertise requirements and, as such, is of the view that it is prudent that those considerations should be factored into developing the role, and associated skill set, required of the appointee.</p><p>My Office is actively engaging with PAS in relation to filling the Professional Accountant Grade 1 posts.</p></reply>

The scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The scheme is operated by the SBCI through participating finance providers. It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following my announcement on 8 April, this scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m.</p><p>There has been strong appetite for the scheme such that as of 10 May 2020, there have been a total of 2,118 applications received to the COVID-19 WCS, of which 2,017 candidates were eligible and 13 ineligible. 88 applications are currently in process. Of those, 189 loans have progressed to sanction to a total value of &euro;33.03 million.</p><p>Based on data currently available, Table 1 of the attached document provides details of the first &euro;21.26 million of loan approvals under this scheme by county. Due to the newness of the scheme, drawdown data is not yet available.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) though participating lenders. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019, resulting in a rapid take up of the scheme.</p><p>As at 8 May 2020, the scheme has received 3,502 eligibility applications, with 3,327 approved, 160 currently in process and 16 deemed ineligible. The initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS scheme has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses. One of the participating financial providers lenders has remaining capacity and businesses seeking loan approval are being directed towards this lender.</p><p>On 8 April 2020, I announced that this scheme would be expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to Covid-19-impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>Based on data available for the first &euro;93.047 million of loans drawn down under the Future Growth Loan Scheme, 100% of these were by SMEs. Table 2 of the attached document provides details of &euro;93.047 million worth of loans drawn down under this scheme on a per-county basis.</p><p>The Covid-19 Loan available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI) was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding during the Covid-19 crisis.  Microenterprises are enterprises with less than ten employees.</p><p>These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period.  These loans are available at an interest rate of 4.5% to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees.  An interest rate of 5.5% is applied to loans which are sought directly from MFI.</p><p>Table 3 of the attached document provides a breakdown by county of loans sanctioned and drawn down under this scheme.</p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme is available to Covid-19 impacted businesses, it supports loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years.  The Scheme offers a partial Government guarantee of 80% to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  The scheme is designed to support a range of debt products appropriate to the borrowing needs of SMEs. Term loans and other products such stocking facilities, performance bonds will be covered by the Scheme.</p><p>The interest rate charged on the loan will be the banks' SME lending rates. In addition, the borrower pays a premium which partially covers the cost of providing the guarantee. The premium can vary but is currently 0.5%.  It may be possible to avail of between a three to six-month interest-only payment period, but this depends on the lender&rsquo;s assessment of the application.</p><p>An application to access the Credit Guarantee Scheme can be made through one of the participating lenders which are currently Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.  The Scheme is operated by SBCI, the Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process, which, is fully delegated to the participating lenders. The Credit Guarantee Scheme facilitates guarantees up to a maximum of &euro;150 million in any one year.</p><p>There have been no approved facilities arising from Covid-19 submitted to SBCI from financial providers.</p><p>On 2 May, Government also agreed a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available from AIB, BOI and Ulster Bank.  This scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment. It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. The guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.  The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers and will have interest rates below current market rates.  The implementation of this Scheme will require legislation, the drafting of which has been approved by Government.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19.</p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15 May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can re-open under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website <i>gov.ie</i>.</p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate.</p><p>The Protocol is available at<i></i></p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or <i>wcu@hsa.ie</i>.</p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see <i></i>.</p><p>On 8 May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30 June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000. </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country, I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to flex the plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase.

We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings.</p>  <p>  Even with the enhanced cohort of inspectors available to the HSA, they cannot be expected to go into every business in the country. That would be entirely unrealistic and unachievable. What they will do is a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSAs Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline.</p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the reopening of the economy began on Monday last and, the HSA and other inspectors are out there advising and guiding employers on how to respect the Protocol.  Helping businesses to comply is the overall goal of the HSA.  However if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved.</p>  <p>  All matters will be kept under review as the phased re-opening of the economy gets underway over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

These reviews are evidence based and are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, a public consultation process, input from the relevant Government Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department. Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and , in the current context, COVID 19.  </p>  <p>  Clearly the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to severely impact our economy, will cause us to look closely at the evolving challenges that present in the labour market for some time to come.  Based on the evidence, submissions received, consultation with key stakeholders and the input of the Interdepartmental Group any changes proposed to the employment permits regime will be submitted for my consideration and approval. </p>  <p>  A fundamental review of Economic Migration Policy, in 2018, indicated that the employment permits system, while providing a robust basis for the management of economic migration, the current legislation imposed a degree of inflexibility on the operation of the system. The review overseen by the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, included a public consultation process and an international benchmarking exercise. The Review&rsquo;s recommendations included the drafting of a new bill to adjust the legislative structure of the system, to allow for swift responses to changes in labour supply and demand, or employment practices. Government approval has been secured for the General Scheme and work has commenced on the development of the legislation. </p></reply>

The work of the Forum will continue to focus on the future development and long-term viability of the retail sector, including considerations about town centre renewal and enhancement through the Framework for Town Centre Renewal, in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development and other relevant Departments, as well as through Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>The Government will continue to actively engage with business owners and representative bodies. Local Authorities, who have longstanding experience in dealing with ratepayers, are assessing the impact of COVID-19 by engaging directly with individual ratepayers, recognising that there may be impacts on sectors outside of those initially identified as being most under threat.</p><p>The supports announced on 2nd May include a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses and a restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver/rebate from 2019. </p><p>These new supports acknowledge that affected businesses need time and space to restructure and resume activity, without the added pressures of trying to repay legacy debts, such as commercial rents, when revenues are just beginning to return.</p><p>Through the Enterprise Forum and Retail Forum, both of which I chair, I am hearing from stakeholders about these issues and I have asked my officials to raise the matter across a number of Government Departments. </p><p>I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.</p><p>Mr. Dolan may be interested in talking to his Local Enterprise Office regarding the Trading Online Voucher Scheme which is available to all micro enterprises with less than 10 employees, including those in the retail sector. The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Vouchers are a key Government grant to help small and micro enterprises, with very limited or no e-commerce presence, to get online, boost their sales and reach new markets &ndash; particularly during this difficult period, when so many small businesses are closed to the public. </p><p>However, the value of the Trading Online Voucher will stand to businesses for years to come, boosting revenue, and helping sustain and create jobs into the future. </p><p>The Voucher can be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to websites or developing new apps for customers, with co-funding from the business currently set at just 10 percent. The Voucher can also be used towards subscriptions to low-cost online retail platform solutions to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online. Training and further business supports are also provided along with the Scheme. </p><p>Further details about the expanding Trading Online Voucher Scheme are available at </p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is designed to support employers and workers to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, when the economy begins to re-open.  The Protocol and other guidance and templates from the HSA are available here . </p><p>I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector in developing their viability, their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness.</p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15 May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can re-open under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website <i>gov.ie</i>.</p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. </p><p>The Protocol is available at <i></i></p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see . </p><p>On 8 May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30 June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000. </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country, I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to flex the plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.</p></reply>

My immediate concern is for the workers and families who have been impacted by this announcement. Many of these workers have been with the company for many years, which makes this news all the more difficult.</p>  <p>  The IDA have been in contact with senior management at National Pen and will continue to work closely with the company to support and maintain the Dundalk operation. The company has stated that it has experienced a significant decline in demand for its products. It has advised the IDA that the steps being taken now are necessary to secure the long-term future of the business and preserve the positions of the majority of the workers at the Dundalk operation. </p>  <p>  It is important to remember that, despite the loss of these roles, National Pen will continue to be a significant employer in the region. The company has confirmed that it remains committed to operating in Ireland and will retain 380 staff in Dundalk. </p>  <p>  The Government will make every State support available to employees impacted by this announcement. My Department, the Department of Social Protection, as well as our State Agencies, will all be doing their utmost to help workers transition and find new employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has already made the company aware of the Government supports that are available. I understand that the IDA will also be working with National Pen&rsquo;s HR team to connect staff with other clients in the IDA portfolio in due course. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s economy, as we all know, is outward-facing, export-orientated and reliant to a large degree on global FDI. This means that when a multinational company makes decisions, either as result of Covid-19 or for other business reasons, we unfortunately can feel the impact here.</p>  <p>  However, the employment situation in Louth has been positive in recent years with over 4,400 staff employed in IDA firms in Louth, a more than threefold increase on 2010. The pipeline of new jobs has included significant investments from Wuxi Biologic, Panasonic, Wuxi Vaccines and PCI Pharma. </p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15 May the Government announced that we would move to move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday 18 May. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can re -open under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. </p><p>The Protocol is available at </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme,  grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see . </p><p>On 8 May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30 June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000. </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country, I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to flex the plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.</p></reply>

This fund for smaller businesses provides &euro;25,000 and &euro;50,000 in repayable advances, depending on size and turnover of company. This fund will provide liquidity to enable these enterprises to steer a pathway towards recovery and to introduce measures in response to the controls and health and safety requirements in line with changing work patterns and protocols and guidelines being introduced as we begin the re-opening of the economy.</p>  <p>  On 15 May last, the Government also agreed the arrangements for the new &euro;250m &ldquo;Restart Grant&rdquo; for micro enterprises and small businesses.  The "Restart Grant"  is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. It will be a critically important tool to support small businesses to reopen their doors and get back on their feet. This grant will enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business.</p>  <p>  The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  Applications for the "Restart Grant" can be made online to all local authorities from Friday 22 May.</p>  <p>  In addition to the extensive package of liquidity measures announced, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19.  In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable under the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p></reply>

The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages, however, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.</p><p>In order to ensure that the employment permits system is responsive to changes in economic circumstances and labour market conditions, it is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists for the purpose of granting an employment permit, which are subject to twice yearly review. These reviews, which are evidence based and are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, as well as a public consultation process and input from the relevant Government Departments as well as the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department. Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19.  </p><p>At the end of April 2020 there was a 6% increase in the number of applications received over the same period in 2019, and there was a 15% increase in the number of permits issued over the same period in 2019.  Since the COVID-19 crisis began, the Department has been prioritising the processing of employment permit applications for medical personnel and these applications continue to be prioritised.  Since mid-March, this has resulted in 1,404 employment permits issuing to medical personnel, accounting for approx. 37% of  permits issued in that period.</p><p>The statistics request by the Deputy are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Permits Issued</th>       <th>Permits Issued</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>2020 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jan </td>       <td>1,556 </td>       <td>1,349 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Feb  </td>       <td>1,196 </td>       <td>1,447 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March </td>       <td>1,155 </td>       <td>1,228 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April </td>       <td>1,112 </td>       <td>1,769 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May </td>       <td>1,359 </td>       <td>831 (at COB 15th May)</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has implemented a contingency plan to ensure that the Employment Permit system continues to operate throughout the crisis.

The Protocol was drafted in close consultation with the social partners under the auspices of the Labour and Employer Economic Forum and agreed with them.</p>  <p>  Compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol is being led by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), who have overall responsibility for ensuring the health, safety and welfare at work of all workers. While the HSA has an overall complement of about 100 in the inspectorate grade, between 60 and 70 of these will initially be deployed across sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol. The HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities. These will be warranted by me, using powers in the 2005 Act, to carry out COVID-19 inspections under the Protocol, as the economy opens up in line with the Government Roadmap.</p>  <p>  As we have seen with the general public health measures over the past two months, most people are complying with the rules. We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.1775.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000137#WROO06800"><p>The issues businesses are facing in respect of commercial rents / leases have been raised with me through the Enterprise Forum and Retail Forum, both of which I chair, and other channels.</p><p>These are difficult times and many companies have had to temporarily close their businesses and/or premise(s), curtail their activities or make alternative work arrangements due to COVID-19 restrictions. I am keenly aware that some businesses are concerned that some landlords are continuing to insist on the payment of rents and leases as normal despite their premises being closed.</p><p>At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance or security costs, that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank / lender will accept. The Minister for Finance raised the broader issue of rents in meetings with the pillar banks. He referenced this in his announcement of 18 March concerning an arrangement with the banks to the effect that any landlord who has agreed a deal with the banks on foot of the arrangement will be expected to pass the benefit on to their tenants. I reiterated this in the D&aacute;il on 30 April last.</p><p>While commercial leases are primarily a contractual matter for the tenant and the landlord, the Government has urged landlords to demonstrate forbearance in these extraordinary times and to play their part, as everyone must, in helping the country through this difficult period. I would encourage tenants and landlords to engage with each other on this matter and come to some arrangement as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed.</p><p>I have asked my officials to raise the matter of commercial rents and leases across a number of Government Departments. An initial inter-departmental discussion has already taken place and I understand further engagement is underway with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.</p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants.</p><p>The matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents has been raised with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed by Government. I have just received a response in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. I have asked my officials to consider this advice.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>I would like to point out that the Government has introduced a range of measures aimed at supporting businesses including:</p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme supports loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years. Applications can be made to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. Eligibility criteria apply.</p><p>- Microenterprises can access COVID-19 Business Loans of up to &euro;50,000 from Microfinance Ireland. The terms include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. Businesses can apply through their Local Enterprise Office or directly online at www.microfinanceireland.ie. </p><p>- The new &euro;450m SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme for eligible businesses supports loans from &euro;25,000 up to &euro;1.5 million (first &euro;500,000 unsecured). Applications can be made through the SBCI website at www.sbci.gov.ie.  </p><p>- An additional &euro;200 million in COVID-19 funding for the Future Growth Loan Scheme, which will be released in tranches, will provide longer-term loans to COVID-19 impacted businesses.</p><p>- The new Sustaining Enterprise Fund of up to &euro;180 million is specifically aimed at firms with 10 or more employees impacted by COVID-19 that are vulnerable but viable. The fund is operated by Enterprise Ireland, providing repayable advances of up to &euro;800,000 as agreed with the EU under new State Aid rules.</p><p>On 2 May, a number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted were introduced. These included:</p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver/rebate from 2019 (see below for more information);</p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;</p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt;</p><p>- A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue provide full services to the public.</p><p>These supports acknowledge that impacted businesses need time and space to restructure and resume activity, without the added pressures of trying to repay legacy debts, such as commercial rents, when revenues are just beginning to return.</p><p>On Friday 15th May last, the Government agreed the arrangements for the new &euro;250m &ldquo;Restart Grant&rdquo; for micro enterprises and small businesses.  The Restart Grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. Eligible businesses will receive a Restart Grant equivalent to their commercial rates assessment for 2019 (excluding arrears), subject to a minimum grant of &euro;2,000 and a maximum of &euro;10,000.</p><p>This grant will provide funding to enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business.</p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at www.gov.ie or on my Department&rsquo;s website ().</p></reply>

The Protocol was drafted in close consultation with the social partners under the auspices of the Labour and Employer Economic Forum and agreed with them. </p>  <p>  Compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol is being led by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), who have overall responsibility for ensuring the health, safety and welfare at work of all workers. </p>  <p>  The HSA is deploying all its available inspectors across sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol.  The HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities.  As we have seen with the general public health measures over the past two months, most people are complying with the rules. We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings. </p>  <p>  I am expecting employers and workers, in line with what is set out in the Protocol, to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying the clear measures set out in the Protocol, for the health and safety of all concerned.</p>  <p>  Even with the enhanced cohort of inspectors available to the HSA, they cannot be expected to go into every business in the country. That would be entirely unrealistic and unachievable. What they will do is a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSAs Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline. </p>  <p>  If, following contact from a worker, and follow-up engagement with the employer, they feel that an inspection is warranted, they will follow up with an on-site visit.  </p>  <p>  Importantly, if, on foot of an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action - up to and including the closure of a workplace - will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved, and we have already seen this in the case of the meat processing plants. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the steps that we have taken are giving both employers and employees the confidence to re-open businesses and return to work. </p></reply>

It is chaired by the Chief Medical Officer. The NPHET oversees and provides national direction, guidance, support and expert advice on the development and implementation of a strategy to contain COVID-19 in Ireland.  It is not a permanent structure, but rather is established in response to emerging public health emergencies.  </p><p>The NPHET is a long -standing mechanism, which has been utilised over many years to provide a forum to steer strategic approaches to public health emergencies in Ireland and to mobilise the necessary health service responses.  This is consistent with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under World Health Organisation International Health Regulations, where States are required to establish multidisciplinary /multisectoral teams to respond to events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. </p><p>The National Action Plan on COVID-19, published on 16 March, 2020 states that Ireland&rsquo;s approach will be to &ldquo;continue to deliver a public health-led evidence-based Government-wide response to COVID-19, including enabling the NPHET to advise across Government, drive immediate actions, and steer contingency planning, as well as appropriate and proportionate decision-making&rdquo;.</p><p><b></b>The composition of any particular NPHET established will depend on the nature of the particular public health threat in question.  There are currently 31 multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral members on the NPHET.

The Chief Clinical Officer, National Director of Acute Operations and National Director for Community Operations are among the 11 representatives of the HSE on NPHET, as are the Interim Director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the National Clinical Director, Health Protection. The NPHET also communicates directly with the HSE National Crisis Management Team which leads and manages the HSE&rsquo;s response.</p><p>In addition, the NPHET benefits from the insights of medical professionals working at the frontline of the COVID-19 response through the members representing the Irish College of General Practitioners, and from the disciplines of intensive care, infectious diseases, virology, psychiatry and geriatrics. </p><p>It is important to note that while NPHET is coordinating Ireland&rsquo;s public health response to COVID-19 it is supported by nine sub-groups including Acute Hospitals; Vulnerable People; Irish Epidemiological Modelling; Health Sector Workforce and others. The NPHET is also supported in developing its recommendations by an Expert Advisory Group. All told, there are in excess of 200 people representing over 50 organisations across academia, Government, community &amp;amp; voluntary sectors as well as the breadth of the health system. Each provides their clinical, policy, and operational expertise to inform the advice that is presented to Government in response to the pandemic. The full governance arrangements for the NPHET were published by the Government on 28 April last at </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the NPHET is not an executive body in and of itself. Its members are drawn from across the public, voluntary and medical sectors and its remit is to provide me as Minister for Health, and the Government, with appropriate public health advice. </p><p>Those members of the NPHET who are officials of the Department of Health are accountable to the Secretary General of the Department and to me. The CEO of the HSE, Mr Paul Reid, has nominated the HSE officials sitting on the NPHET, and a similar situation prevails with regard to the other organisations represented on the NPHET.</p><p>The composition of any NPHET is dependent upon the nature of the threat being faced. In the current situation, in the face of a highly infectious and fast moving disease, where the understanding of the epidemiology of the virus is constantly evolving, it requires the flexibility to alter its membership on an ongoing basis and at pace in order to ensure that the appropriate expertise is available to deliver the best possible advice to myself and the Government.</p><p>I am in continuous contact with the Secretary General of the Department, the Chief Medical Officer and the Management Board of the Department and am consistently briefed on the innovative and flexible approach that is being adopted in responding to this devastating new global public health threat.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

International and national evidence shows that those over 70 years and people with specific underlying health conditions are groups with an elevated risk for COVID-19. On this basis, it is recommended that the cocooning measures for the over 70s and for those in at risk groups be continued&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Any future changes to the current public health measures and recommendations in place will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria set out in the Roadmap and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.  </p>  <p>   On 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  In relation to vulnerable or at risk workers the Protocol advises that if an at-risk or vulnerable worker cannot work from home and must be in the workplace, employers must make sure that they are preferentially supported to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres. However, employers should enable vulnerable workers to work from home where possible.</p>  <p>  The Protocol is not static. There will be ongoing engagement at a national level between stakeholders on its implementation and it is subject to change in line with the latest public health advice or other developments in order to maximise the protection it will afford in our workplaces.</p></reply>

This programme is part of a range of measures and supports that have been put in place for this sector. The programme of testing for nursing homes involved the testing of all staff and residents in facilities where there was an outbreak and the testing of all staff in facilities that had no cases. </p>  <p>  In addition, current guidance requires the testing of all staff and residents when a new case emerges in a facility that has not yet had a case. Analysis from the current mass testing programme will help inform and guide future testing strategy for long term residential care facilities. I understand that this will be considered by NPHET in the coming week. It is important to note that testing should always be informed by a public health risk assessment and directed by Public Health.</p>  <p>  Up to 13 May, the HSE advise that over 90,900 tests have been completed under the residential care facilities mass testing programme which includes nursing homes. It also advises that testing under this programme has now been completed in nursing homes (577 sites). Turnaround times have improved significantly but there remain examples of delays which is unsatisfactory. I am confident that the HSE is putting in place the measures to reduce turnaround times and we&rsquo;re seeing continuing improvement. It continues to streamline the process and to automate where possible so as to reach its target to have an average turnaround time of 1-3 days from referral to result. </p></reply>

International and national evidence shows that those over 70 years and people with specific underlying health conditions are groups with an elevated risk for COVID-19. On this basis, it is recommended that the cocooning measures for the over 70s and for those in at risk groups be continued&rdquo;.</p><p>The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows: </p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria: </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease, </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c.

It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19. </p><p>In relation to vulnerable or at risk workers the Protocol advises that if an at risk or vulnerable worker cannot work from home and must be in the workplace, employers must make sure that they are preferentially supported to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres. However, employers should enable vulnerable workers to work from home where possible.</p><p>The Protocol is not static. There will be ongoing engagement at a national level between stakeholders on its implementation and it is subject to change in line with the latest public health advice or other developments in order to maximise the protection it will afford in our workplaces.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p>  <p>  A major part of the Government's Action Plan was to substantially increase the capacity of healthcare facilities to cope with the anticipated additional demand. As part of the Action Plan to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. The arrangement is in place for 3 months up to the end of June, with an option to extend it. Under the Heads of Terms to the agreement, a decision to extend the arrangement must be notified to the private hospitals by the end of this month. The arrangement is currently under review and depending on the outcome, a decision will be made on whether or not to extend it. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. </p>  <p>  In line with the expert advice, delivery of essential non-Covid care has continued to date, although at significantly lower volumes than previously. In particular, the delivery of cancer care, urgent surgery and trauma services are areas in which care continues to be delivered, often in alternative locations and using innovative methods of care delivery. Where possible, hospitals are working to provide services in a different way, which includes virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. Cancer services are continuing with prioritisation of time-sensitive treatment, and the ongoing review of the location of the delivery of cancer services. </p>  <p>  The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-covid care, for patients and healthcare workers, and support safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the Expert Advisory Subgroup of NPHET (EAG) and approved in principle by NPHET. This guidance includes, for example, guidance on screening, swabbing and use of PPE. </p>  <p>  In collaboration with my Department&rsquo;s communications team, research to understand why some people are avoiding interacting with health services has been initiated. Findings from a survey and focus groups commissioned by the Department indicate that fear of infection is one of the primary factors influencing peoples' reluctance in attending for acute services.  This data has informed the development of an advertisement campaign reassuring the public that GP services and EDs are available and open for business, with changes made to accommodate patients safely in the context of Covid-19. The campaign commenced on Monday 11th May, through national and local radio and social media, supported by local spokespeople and will be revised or concluded in line with impact seen on the ground.</p>  <p>  In terms of understanding the impact of COVID-19 on waiting lists, the HSE and my Department are actively working to build methodologies for gathering relevant data to try to facilitate not only a better understanding of the health system at this time, but to try to model growing service demands as the year progresses and as the health system continues to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Outpatient waiting list at the end of April shows an increase of 5,636 in comparison to the end of March. The figure for those waiting less than 3 months has fallen by 24,076 in the same period, a reflection of the decrease in referrals by GPs. Meanwhile, the number of patients awaiting an Inpatient or Day Case (IPDC) procedure increased by 8,595 at the end of April when compared to the end of March waiting list.  During the same period the number on the &lsquo;To Come In&rsquo; (TCI) list (those with an appointment for a procedure in the next six weeks) has reduced by 5,427.  Accordingly, a large part of the increase in the IPDC waiting list relates to patients moving back to the Active waiting list from the TCI list.  While the IPDC waiting list figure at the end of April is indicative of fewer patients being treated, it is of note that there were also fewer patients seen in Outpatient clinics in the same period and as a consequence fewer patients were referred for procedures.</p></reply>

The impact of any imported cases on disease spread would be all the greater in the context of easing of domestic restrictions and the resultant increased movement and contact between people. In addition, a significant increase in the number of cases in Ireland as a result of importation could have an impact on public compliance with public health guidance and restrictions. Ultimately, the suppression of community transmission which has been achieved and which should allow for greater resumption of social and economic life in Ireland could be endangered. </p>  <p>  To date, Ireland has introduced a range of travel related measures including issuing advice against non-essential international travel on 13th March.  As of 24th April, passengers arriving into Ireland from overseas are expected to complete the Public Health Passenger Locator Form and to self-isolate for 14 days. Self-isolation means staying indoors and avoiding contact with other people and is a more stringent measure than the stay at home requirements that apply to the wider public. </p>  <p>  Intensive work is underway by my Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, to finalise regulations to come into effect in the coming days that will make it mandatory for passengers arriving to the State from overseas to present a completed Public Health Passenger Locator Form. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments, is also developing proposals to strengthen the 14 days self-isolation arrangements for travellers from overseas. These proposals will include possible enforcement measures.  The issue of imposing mandatory quarantine for a 14 day period, to be considered as the situation evolves, was mentioned in the Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that self-isolation arrangements will continue to apply to passengers arriving from overseas, irrespective of the country from which they are travelling. Passengers transiting to another jurisdiction and who will not be residing in the State, including transiting to Northern Ireland, will be exempt.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria: </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease, </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period. </p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens  and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc. </p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.</p></reply>

It is an equality issue. Government has had a whole of Government approach to disability for a number of years. The Department of Justice and Equality is the lead for policy coordination for disability and  equality.</p>  <p>  Our National Disability Inclusion Strategy captures a wide range of actions across Government Departments that will impact on the lives of people with disabilities and is to be viewed as a blueprint for an inclusive, accessible and equal country that incorporates issues that affect quality of life, health, education and transport;</p>  <p>  Underpinning the Strategy is a vision of an Irish society in which people with disabilities across the lifecycle enjoy equal rights and opportunities to participate in social and cultural life, can work if they want to do so, have choice and control over how they live their lives, and can reach their full potential.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I published a mid-term review of the Strategy. When the Strategy concludes in 2021, my aim is for Ireland to be a better place for people with disabilities to live in, a place where people with disabilities are involved and consulted with on matters and decisions that affect their lives. It should be a country where people with disabilities can enjoy full equality, participate fully in our society, and enjoy a quality of life on a par with the rest of the population.</p>  <p>  The NDIS provides a framework in which we can work to achieve this aim.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria: </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,  </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions. </p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period. </p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens  and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc. </p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p>  <p>  A major part of the Government's Action Plan was to substantially increase the capacity of healthcare facilities to cope with the anticipated additional demand. As part of the Action Plan to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. A Heads of Terms of an Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. The arrangement is in place for 3 months up to the end of June, with an option to extend it. Under the Heads of Terms to the agreement, a decision to extend the arrangement must be notified to the private hospitals by the end of this month. The arrangement is currently under review and depending on the outcome, a decision will be made on whether or not to extend it. </p></reply>

A testing and tracing process with sufficient capacity and quick turnaround is one of a number of core criteria in determining when it is safe for countries to reduce restrictive public health measures. </p>  <p>  The HSE, together with the Department of Health and other bodies, has worked hard in the last two months to develop Ireland&rsquo;s testing and tracing process, to expand capacity and to reduce turnaround times. </p>  <p>  A designated team, led by a senior manager reporting directly to the CEO, has been established in the HSE to oversee the development, management and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s testing and contact tracing process. This includes responsibility for the scaling up of capacity and the speeding up of turnaround times with a clear focus on achieving ambitious targets and continuous improvement. On 14 May the HSE launched its Roadmap for testing and tracing with clear targets and arrange of actions to achieve these targets.</p>  <p>  The work of the HSE on testing and contact tracing is informed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The NPHET oversees and will continue to provide national direction, guidance, support and expert advice on the development and implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to contain COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made over the last two months. 47 community testing centres have been established; over 40 laboratories are processing tests; 9 new contact tracing centres have been set up and some 1,700 public servants have been trained in contact tracing to support the work of public health departments. A quick testing referral pathway for GPs is in place, and new IT systems have been developed or modified. </p>  <p>  Ireland's testing strategy has evolved as our testing capacity has grown. A number of changes have been made to the case definition so that anyone presenting with acute respiratory infection comprising the sudden onset of least one of the following symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath) can be referred for testing. A mass testing programme across nursing homes, mental health and disability facilities is nearing completion, and, as of this week, all close contacts of someone with Covid-19 will be automatically referred for testing. Our strategy is to target testing at those groups or populations where the virus is most likely to be and where it will do most harm.</p>  <p>  The HSE advise that from this week it has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day. Turnaround times have continued to improve and the HSE advise that it is on target to complete the testing process from referral to the completion of contact tracing within 3 days or less in 90% cases. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise these systems and capacity have been developed from a standing start and to recognise the tremendous work which has gone in to getting us to the point we are now at. It is also important to recognise the context in which this is happening: Ireland is already testing at a higher rate than most countries and our targets are ambitious. Data published on 12 May shows Ireland ranks 4th highest out of 25 EU+UK countries in terms of tests completed as a percentage of the overall population. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work intensively to further develop processes and turnaround times across the testing and tracing pathway and a range of further improvements will be rolled out in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

It was for this reason that NDTP HSE have aimed to provide certainty regarding the changeover date to NCHDs as early as possible.  With regard to accommodation challenges, there is temporary accommodation available for healthcare workers and information on same is available on the HSE's website. Induction is extremely important when commencing a new job and NDTP, HSE are aware that local employers are preparing to deliver as much as possible of this on-line and by utilising resources such as HSE Land.</p>  <p>  This decision is being monitored, and obviously should there be a significant deterioration in relation to Covid-19, the decision will be reviewed accordingly. It is noted that the HSE intends that closer to the NCHD changeover, advice will issue from the National Health and Well Being Unit to NCHDs who are required to rotate and also to local Occupational Health Departments. Also, the early commencement for interns this week, rather than July, and Senior House Officers rotating primarily within their geographical area will assist the transition. Whilst it is acknowledged that none of these measures is a perfect solution, they will mitigate challenges and assist NCHDs during this time and through changeover.</p></reply>

Self-isolation means staying indoors and avoiding contact with other people and is a more stringent measure than the stay at home requirements that apply to the wider public. </p>  <p>  Intensive work is underway by my Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, to finalise regulations to come into effect in the coming days that will make it mandatory for passengers arriving to the State from overseas to present a completed Public Health Passenger Locator Form. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments, is also developing proposals to strengthen the 14 days self-isolation arrangements for travellers from overseas. These proposals will include possible enforcement measures.  The issue of imposing mandatory quarantine for a 14 day period, to be considered as the situation evolves, was mentioned in the Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that self-isolation arrangements will continue to apply to passengers arriving from overseas, irrespective of the country from which they are travelling. Passengers transiting to another jurisdiction and who will not be residing in the State, including transiting to Northern Ireland, will be exempt. </p></reply>

The strategy aims to provide an integrated public health approach to drug and alcohol use, focused on reducing the harms for individuals, families and communities and promoting rehabilitation and recovery.  </p>  <p>  The strategy contains 50 actions for delivery between 2017 to 2020. The implementation of these actions is monitored though the national oversight structures, supported by the coordinated system of monitoring, research and evaluation set out in the strategy.</p>  <p>  The Department is preparing to carry out a mid-term review of the strategy at the end of 2020. This will provide an opportunity to reflect on progress in implementing the strategy, with scope to develop further actions between 2021 and 2025 to address emerging needs. All stakeholders will have an opportunity to contribute to this review through their participation in the oversight structures.  </p>  <p>  I believe that the national drug strategy is a dynamic process, with the flexibility to adapt to needs that may emerge over the lifetime of the strategy. The mid-term review is an opportunity to reflect on progress and to identify new challenges. The review is timely as it will allow policy to take into account the impact of Covid-19 on people who use drugs and on drugs and alcohol services and to plan accordingly for the remaining five years of the strategy.</p></reply>

This is based on estimates provided by the participating hospitals and will be adjusted based on verified actual costs validly incurred over the period. As the hospitals are private enterprises, the detailed information regarding payments to individual hospitals or hospital groups is commercially sensitive and therefore in line with the Heads of Terms regarding confidentiality these details will not be published.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The impact of any imported cases on disease spread would be all the greater in the context of easing of domestic restrictions and the resultant increased movement and contact between people. In addition, a significant increase in the number of cases in Ireland as a result of importation could have an impact on public compliance with public health guidance and restrictions. Ultimately, the suppression of community transmission which has been achieved and which should allow for greater resumption of social and economic life in Ireland could be endangered. </p>  <p>  To date, Ireland has introduced a range of travel related measures including issuing advice against non-essential international travel on 13th March.  As of 24th April, passengers arriving into Ireland from overseas are expected to complete the Public Health Passenger Locator Form and to self-isolate for 14 days. Self-isolation means staying indoors and avoiding contact with other people and is a more stringent measure than the stay at home requirements that apply to the wider public. </p>  <p>  Intensive work is underway by my Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, to finalise regulations to come into effect in the coming days that will make it mandatory for passengers arriving to the State from overseas to present a completed Public Health Passenger Locator Form. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments, is also developing proposals to strengthen the 14 days self-isolation arrangements for travellers from overseas. These proposals will include possible enforcement measures.  The issue of imposing mandatory quarantine for a 14 day period, to be considered as the situation evolves, was mentioned in the Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that self-isolation arrangements will continue to apply to passengers arriving from overseas, irrespective of the country from which they are travelling. Passengers transiting to another jurisdiction and who will not be residing in the State, including transiting to Northern Ireland, will be exempt.</p></reply>

It facilitates the sharing of information between the Department of Health and its agencies, including the HSE. It provides a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to public health emergencies. This approach is in line with the advice of the World Health Organization.   </p>  <p>  HSE guidelines aim to assist staff in residential care facilities, including nursing homes, in their management of COVID-19 cases, including in relation to decisions on transfer of residents, to hospitals, where appropriate.   </p>  <p>  The HSE through the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has developed an extensive body of guidance and support tools to assist staff in residential care facilities, including nursing homes, in their management of COVID-19 cases, including in relation to decisions on transfer of residents, to hospitals, where appropriate. The current relevant guidelines are the &ldquo;Interim Public Health and Infection Prevention Control Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of COVID-19 Cases and Outbreaks in Residential Care Facilities and Similar Units" (version 4.1 dated 4 May 2020).</p>  <p>  The advice states that &ldquo;People with confirmed COVID-19 should not be transferred to a residential care facility [RCF] until 14 days after onset of symptoms with the last 5 days free of fever. In addition, they should have two nasopharyngeal samples taken at least 24 hours apart reported as not detected.  Residents who fulfil the above criteria are not infectious and do not need any special considerations in terms of placement within the RCF.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  The advice notes that: &ldquo;For those hospitalised patients with a persistent positive PCR test for COVID-19, IPC precautions should be kept in place for another 7 days (i.e. for a total of 21 days) and then removed, provided the patient has no symptoms consistent with ongoing COVID-19 infection at this point. No further retesting is required, as the risk of transmission is extremely low at this point. After 21 days, they can then be discharged from hospital to residential settings, if well enough for discharge.&rdquo;</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:  </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease, </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.  </p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period. </p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens  and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc. </p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p></reply>

Article 2(1) places an obligation on the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  The Ethical Framework for Decision Making in a Pandemic published by the Department of Health on 27th  March seeks to ensure that public health measures in response to a pandemic are implemented  in a manner that is equitable, reasonable, proportionate, in compliance with national and international law (including the ECHR) and which does not discriminate against particular groups or individuals. The ethical framework sets out clear ethical principles that will guide people in acting so as to produce the greatest good, to ensure the best use of resources and to ensure fairness.  It also sets out the values or principles governing how decisions are going to be made. </p>  <p>  The positive obligation of Article 2 finds its expression in particular in the ethical principles of minimising harm, duty to provide care and reciprocity contained in the Framework. Building on the Framework, on April 7th the Department published the &ldquo;Ethical Considerations Relating to Critical Care in the context of COVID-19&rdquo;.  In line with the principle of minimising harm, the document discusses the duty to use limited resources prudently and fairly to minimise the loss of life and suffering and produce the maximal benefit possible for individuals served by those interventions. The document makes clear that everyone is morally equally; that every life matters and that everyone should receive care. As per the procedural values outlines in the framework, any allocation procedure must be fair, clinically justified, transparent and documented. In recognition of the duty of care that State has regarding healthcare workers, the Department issued a paper entitled &ldquo;Ethical Considerations for PPE Use by Health Care Workers in a Pandemic&rdquo; on 21 April 21st  which considers to what extent health care workers have an obligation to provide, or participate in the provision of, a medical intervention where there are constraints on supplies of PPE.</p></reply>

The National Cancer Control Programme reports that attendance remains relatively high.  Radiation oncology is continuing at approximately 80% capacity.

The patients will remain under the care of their existing consultant, if the consultant is already employed by the HSE or if the consultant is a whole-time private practice practitioner who accepts the HSE&rsquo;s offer of a temporary contract.</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the Government&rsquo; s National Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group and it is envisaged that private hospitals will play a key role in providing this care. </p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:  </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.  </p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.  </p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.  </p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks. </p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.  </p><p>In general, with the exception of public health matters, the responsibility for providing guidance and advice in relation to a particular sector or on a specific activity remains with the Government Department with responsibility for that sector or activity.</p></reply>

The outcomes from this work, aims to provide the intelligence to support more robust and effective discussions and decisions on health workforce resourcing to meet population health needs into the future.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of the workforce planning actions link directly with the Slaintecare action to build a sustainable, resilient workforce that is supported and enabled to deliver the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.   </p>  <p>  In relation to workforce planning efforts during the current pandemic, there are numerous initiatives taking place to maximise the health workforce to meet the needs of the service during this time.  These include increasing the hours of part time staff, rehiring retired clinicians, employment of students and recent graduates, redeployment of staff and encouraging those on career break to return early.     </p>  <p>  The Be on Call for Ireland initiative is a further means being used to create reserve pools of &lsquo;job ready&rsquo; health care professionals&rsquo; to use &lsquo;as and when&rsquo; they are needed for the response to COVID-19.  Those contracted via this initiative are offered a short term contract, which may be reviewed at a later date once the impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system is understood.  </p>  <p>  Concerning nursing education, between  2017 and 2019  the number of  undergraduate training places for nursing and midwifery increased by 260 , from 1,570 to 1,830. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the first group of  these additional students will be due to graduate in 2021 and be in a position to join the nursing and midwifery workforce.  </p>  <p>  Concerning future nursing pay, the 2019 Nursing Agreement provides for an Expert Review of the Nursing Profession. This Review shall examine those outstanding union claims as detailed in the Labour Court recommendation (LCR21900/21901). Department officials are currently examining how this Review can commence its activities in the current environment and I am looking forward to seeing a date set for this Review in the near future. </p>  <p>  Concerning the implementation of the pay measures contained in the Nursing Agreement, in July 2019 the HSE commenced the implementation of those pay measures. The HSE has since issued all circulars to activate these measures including adjustments to allowances and the opening up of the applications process to the new Enhanced Nurse Scale. The HSE has advised that progress has been made in completing the roll out of these measures and many nurses and midwives will have already benefited from these changes. The HSE has also advised that, where it has identified locations where implementation is incomplete, they are working with those locations (including Hospital Groups and CHOs) to complete the process. For the avoidance of doubt, I would like to reassure those nurses and midwives that are due to benefit from this measures that all monies due to them shall be paid to them. </p>  <p>  The preliminary data for April indicates that approx. 4,800 / 38% of applicants to the Enhanced Nurse / Midwife role have been appointed in acute operations. Some Hospital Groups have made considerable progress in appointing successful applicants to the new roles (c.50% of successful applicants in two hospital groups and 97% of successful applicants at CHI have been appointed) while at other locations, progress has been slower. My officials have requested the HSE to prioritise the continued implementation of the agreement. </p>  <p>  For the latest status on the implementation of these payments, I have referred this matter to the HSE for direct answer and reply.   </p></reply>

In anticipation of the projected surge in Covid-19 cases and the expected impact on the health care system, a major part of the Action Plan was to urgently ramp up capacity for acute hospital care facilities.  A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential additional acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. The terms of the arrangement reflected the expected Covid-19 pandemic at time of signing. It is in place for three months up to the end of June, with an option to extend it. Under the Terms to the agreement a decision to extend the arrangement must be notified to the private hospitals by the end of this month.  The arrangement is currently under review and depending on the outcome a decision will be made on whether to extend or not.   Any decision regarding an extension would have to be considered in the context of the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic and the most effective use of resources in tackling it. Therefore, while there is an option to extend the arrangement, it is not intended that the arrangement will be permanent.  </p>  <p>  Acute hospital preparedness for Covid-19 has focused on bed capacity, on protection of non-Covid care, and on a number of other areas including infection control. In line with the Action Plan delivery of essential non-Covid care has continued. In particular, the delivery of cancer care, urgent surgery and trauma services are areas in which care continues to be delivered, including in private hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19  care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, from now on, in regard to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of non-urgent scheduled acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p>  <p>  Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-Covid-19 care, for patients and healthcare workers, to support the safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the NPHET&rsquo;s Expert Advisory Subgroup and approved in principle by NPHET. </p>  <p>  As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 care side by side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid-19 acute care. The trajectory of the disease means that there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of more routine non-Covid-19 care and it is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in the provision of such care. </p></reply>

The Mulvey Agreement was an agreement between the NMH and the SVHG which was finalised in November 2016, following extensive mediation discussions. This Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - NMH at Elm Park DAC - and ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the new hospital without religious, ethnic or other distinction. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the SVHG, the NMH, the HSE and the Chief State Solicitor's Office in relation to the legal framework.  The new hospital, which will remain in State ownership, will be built on a site leased from the SVHG. The State will provide an Operating Licence to the NMH at Elm Park DAC and the SVHG to facilitate the provision of health services in the new building.  </p></reply>

In this regard, where an outbreak of COVID 19 is confirmed families are contacted and kept informed of their loved ones&rsquo; medical status. </p><p>Under the governance of the HSE&rsquo;s National Integrated Operations Hub chaired by the Chief Operations Officer, Disability Operations has a team in place with the responsibility for providing supports and capacity building training for the sector in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, a range of guidance material has been developed. The following web link is the central repository for disability specific guidance material during the  COVID 19 emergency:  </p><p><i> </i></p><p>It contains guidance on:</p><p>1. Alternative models of care (non-residential) </p><p>2. Streamlined hospital passport for people with disabilities who are admitted to hospital </p><p>3. Use of PPE in Disability Services</p><p>4. Supporting adults in a community residence/at home</p><p>5. Supporting children in a community residence/at home </p><p>In addition, a series of &ldquo;webinar&rdquo; training modules to assist frontline staff during the COVID 19 emergency period are available.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens  and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p><p>In general, with the exception of public health matters, the responsibility for providing guidance and advice in relation to a particular sector or on a specific activity remains with the Government Department with responsibility for that sector or activity.</p></reply>

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable improvements to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. Since then the numbers waiting have improved and at the end of April 2020, they stood at 5,831, a reduction of 42%. In the same period the number of patients waiting over 9 months for a cataract procedure fell by 83% from 4,249 to 705. The ophthalmology Inpatient/Daycase and Outpatient waiting lists, as well as the cataract waiting list for end April 2020, are provided for the Deputy below. </p><p>In this context it should be noted that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan in Response to COVID-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently working together to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time. </p><p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p><p>The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p><p>In relation to the treatment for the person concerned, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations between the HSE, supported by my Department, and the private hospitals, an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. The details of the arrangement are contained in the Heads of Terms, which I laid before the Oireachtas on 16 April. </p>  <p>  The decision to take over the use of private hospitals as part of the Covid-19 response has implications for private health insurers and their customers. Each of the private health insurers have since announced measures which are focused towards assisting health insurance customers impacted by the Covid-19 national response, which include partial refunds or reductions to the amount of premium payable during the period of the agreement.   </p>  <p>  The Health Insurance Authority, as the independent statutory regulator of the private health insurance market, advises individuals to check with their own insurance company to find out more information regarding the specific measures that are available to them. Consumers who have concerns about their individual policies can also contact consumer advisors at the Authority for further information (at email address info@hia.ie). </p>  <p>  The arrangement with private hospitals is in place for 3 months up to the end of June, with an option to extend it. Under the Heads of Terms to the agreement a decision to extend the arrangement must be notified to the private hospitals by the end of this month.  The arrangement is currently under review and, depending on the outcome, a decision will be made on whether or not to extend it. </p></reply>

The phone numbers of the hotline are as follows: Call Save: 076 1064408 Phone: 01 6072379</p>  <p>  Details of suspected breaches of animal welfare can also be emailed to animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie.</p></reply>

While there have been calls for an extension to the transition period, including from significant sectors in the UK, the UK Government response continues to be that the transition period will end on 31 December 2020, and that they will not seek an extension. I do not believe that it is helpful to speculate further on the matter at this juncture, other than to note, of course, that an extension is a matter for agreement by both parties in accordance with the timelines laid out.  </p>  <p>  We remain fully abreast of stakeholder concerns in these negotiations and I can assure the Deputy that my Department officials and I are continuing to work within a whole of Government effort to ensure the best possible outcome for the agri-food and fisheries sectors.</p></reply>

While significant progress has been made, final agreement has not yet been reached.  Before the new CAP can be implemented, it will be necessary to reach overall agreement within the Council, and then with the European Parliament and Commission.  Neither the EU Council nor the Parliament have reached agreement on a partial general approach. </p>  <p>  It seems clear at this stage that agreement will not be reached by the end of 2020 and that transitional regulations will be required.  Both the Council and the Parliament have agreed on their position in relation to the transitional period and therefore trilogue discussions between the Council, the Parliament and the Croatian Presidency are expected to take place in June.   </p>  <p>  I have worked hard with my European counterparts, and with Commissioners Hogan and Wojciechowski, to build consensus around the need to maintain a strong CAP budget post-2020.  However, I am aware that there are divergent views amongst Member States on the appropriate level for the budget.  Some, including Ireland, have indicated their willingness to increase their national contributions, once they contribute towards areas of added European value, while others feel equally strongly that the current proposals would be too costly. </p>  <p>  There is still some way to go before agreement can be achieved, but I can assure the Deputy that my Department and I will continue to ensure that protecting the CAP budget remains a key priority for Ireland in these negotiations.</p>  <p>  Agreement on the next MFF is a matter for Heads of State and Government, and requires unanimity by all Member States at the European Council.  The proposed budget must also be agreed by the European Parliament. </p></reply>

The closure of many markets and disruption of established distribution channels, particularly to restaurants and the food service industry domestically and internationally, has seen market demand and sale prices drop very substantially in many of our key markets. However, there are still markets open, both domestically and internationally, and it is important that we continue to supply these markets to maintain food supply, service our established customers and be in a position to take advantage of increased demand as markets open up.  That reopening of markets may commence now that some countries are commencing a phased re-opening from lockdowns, but may take some months to return to a level of normality.</p><p>As part of the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative, the European Union has enacted a new Regulation 2020/560 amending the provisions of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (508/2014) to enable Member States to use their EMFF Operational Programmes to address the impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic on their seafood sectors.  Regrettably, no additional EU funds were made available to accompany the EU initiative.  EMFF Programmes operate over the 2014-20 period and since the Pandemic has hit at a time when EMFF Programmes are coming to an end, Ireland like many other Member States has limited funds remainingI continue to lobby Commissioner Sinkevicius to make additional EU funds available.  However, it is important to note that any EMFF interventions to support our seafood sector during the Pandemic must be funded in the first instance through funds voted for 2020, and EU co-funding is only received retrospectively in 2021.</p><p>I have met with representatives of our fisheries and processing sectors on a number of occasions, most recently on 29 April, to hear their views on the impacts of the Pandemic and how the EMFF Programme may support them during this difficult period.  Representation included the four fisheries producer organisations, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, the fisheries cooperatives and the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association.  There was a positive and constructive engagement, with a broad consensus from industry representatives that aid for temporary tie-up of fishing vessels should be the priority, enabling some vessels to tie-up, while others fished to meet market demands.  There was little support for a storage aid scheme, with those in favour of it wanting it used only to subsidise the cost of cold storage of fish already in storage.  Otherwise, fishing representatives feared that it would create an overhang on the markets and contribute to continued poor market prices when markets recover.  Clearly, using scarce funds for a measure with little industry support, and one that would do nothing to support fishermen going forward, would be a poor use of resources.</p><p>Throughout my discussions with fishing representatives, I have emphasised to them the cross sectoral supports being made available by Government at very significant cost, including the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the Covid-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the Future Growth Loan Scheme, Micro-Finance Ireland Covid-19 Business Loan, Credit Guarantee Scheme and Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme, made available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  I have also highlighted to industry the loan holiday arrangements from the banking sector.  </p><p>In  line with the strong preference of fishing representatives, I announced on 8 May a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme for fishing vessels in the Polyvalent, Beam Trawl and Specific segments of the fleet, to be implemented under Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme 2014-20.  The Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme will be operational from 1 June and will be available to the inshore fleet and to larger vessels.  It will allow vessel owners to voluntarily opt to tie up for a maximum of two months over the period June to August.  </p><p>The Scheme will support the fixed costs incurred by the vessel owners and is designed to complement the Covid-19 wage supports and loan arrangements already being provided by Government to the fishing sector and indeed other sectors of our economy.  The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme are outlined in the table below and range from &euro;6,000 per month for a maximum of two months for the very largest vessels over 24 metres, to &euro;500 per month for a maximum of two months for the very smallest vessels under 6 metres in length.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Size of vessel</th>       <th>Payment over 1-month tie-up period</th>       <th>Payment over 2-month tie-up period</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt;

Any vessel not receiving support to tie-up in any particular month may continue to fish. </p><p>In order to limit the benefits of the Scheme to active vessels, an applicant vessel must have carried out fishing activities at sea for at least 120 days over the 2-year period 2018/19 and have made total first sales of fish to a minimum value of &euro;5,000 in the calendar year 2019, by reference to the Irish Sales Note System administered by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.</p></reply>

However, I also reiterated my ongoing concerns regarding the depth and potential duration of the crisis, and made it clear that these actions can only be the first step.  In particular, I called for additional funding to be made available in the form of exceptional aid for livestock producers.  </p>  <p>  I also called for the CAP post-2020 budget to be fully restored in the next Multiannual Financial Framework.  The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the important role farmers play in putting food on European tables. They are also expected to contribute to achieving higher levels of climate ambition post-2020, and so we must ensure that we have a CAP budget that is fit for purpose. </p></reply>

Ireland's top five export partners for seafood are France, the UK, Spain, Italy and China - all of whom have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While trade to China has begun to reopen and there is demand from the Spanish market in particular and to a much lower degree from the French market, it is clear that this is far below normal levels and the market situation overall remains challenging.</p>  <p>  It has been brought to my attention that there are reports circulating that some wholesalers and retailers in France are being pressured not to stock product from non-domestic sources.  The Irish Embassy in Paris is aware of these concerns and continues to monitor this situation closely.  It is important to note that the closure of the French Food service sector, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, has greatly reduced demand for fish in France. It is expected that the easing of some of the French COVID-19 measures from 11 May will lead to the phased re-opening of the food sector in France but it is still unclear as to when restaurants will reopen for business. </p>  <p>  On a more general note, I have stressed the importance of maintaining the Single Market to the EU Commissioners for Agriculture and Fisheries and to my counterparts in other Member States. </p>  <p>  Of course, there is a small minority who have called for action that would subvert the single market.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that any such action would be very much against the best interests of Irish farmers and fishers.  </p></reply>

I expect the Commission to reflect carefully on the Council discussions, and I look forward to seeing further proposals that will ensure a robust and timely response to the difficulties that look set to continue to affect the agric- food and fisheries sectors over the medium term.</p>  <p>  In relation to fisheries, other Member States shared their issues and concerns about the markets.  Some Member States expressed concern that their available EMFF funding was substantially committed and made clear that, without additional financial resources, they would have difficulty adequately supporting their sectors.  Together, we stressed that the Commission should explore all available options.  As a practical measure, I asked the Commissioner to increase the allowed level of uncaught quota that may be carried over to 2021 for certain stocks in line with scientific advice.  </p>  <p>I announced a temporary voluntary fleet tie-up scheme for fishing vessels in the Polyvalent, Beam Trawl and Specific segments of the fishing fleet which is now open for applications. Eligible vessels will be supported to voluntarily opt to tie up for one or two of the next three months, operational from 1 June 2020 and availability will be extended to the inshore fleet and to larger vessels.  The Scheme will be implemented under Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme 2014-20, co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Union.</p>  <p>   This new Covid-19 Voluntary Fleet Tie-up Scheme will support the fixed costs incurred by owners of fishing vessels while tied-up. The Scheme is designed to complement the Covid-19 wage supports and loan arrangements already being provided by Government to the fishing sector and indeed other sectors of our economy.   </p>  <p>  There are still markets open both domestically and internationally and it is important that we continue to supply these markets to maintain food supply, service our established customers and be in a position to take advantage of increased demand as markets open up. To that extent, we want to see a continuing level of fishing by our fishing fleet. However, to temporarily facilitate the industry to better match fishing activity with market demand, I introduced this temporary scheme to support a portion of our fleet who voluntarily choose to tie up, while others continue fishing.</p></reply>

I understand that Teagasc will shortly publish analysis of a range of  scenarios examining in detail the possible income effects arising from the current COVID pandemic. </p><p>The agri-food sector is an essential part of the economic and social fabric of Ireland, especially in rural and coastal areas, and I am acutely aware of the issues presented to the agri-food sector in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. My Department and I are working to ensure that business and services to farmers can continue, keeping food and other processing facilities operational, ensuring that payments and commercial activities that are necessary to protect farm incomes can continue. </p><p>There are likely to be significant economic impacts for the agri-food sector, arising from reduced demand in key markets around the world.  The loss of high value food service customers is already of significant immediate concern.</p><p>The response to the economic impacts on the sector should include a strong, shared EU response, using the instruments available in the Common Agricultural Policy. I have already highlighted to Commissioner Wojciechowski the serious consequences for farmers and the food industry and the need to ensure that the full range of market supports available under the Common Market Organisation Regulation are made available. These supports include Aids to Private Storage and Exceptional Aid measures, flexibilities when it comes to on-farm inspections and early payment of the Basic Payment Scheme. </p><p>Following Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in leading an agreed EU-27 statement on the need for further supports, the Commission have introduced Aids to Private Storage for Dairy (MP, Butter, Cheese), Beef and Sheepmeat.Private Storage Aid (PSA) is a risk management tool / safety net available to EU producers of certain agricultural products under the CMO regulation (1308/2013). The aim is to facilitate producers to store the product for a stipulated temporary storage period. </p><p>I am also working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that all businesses, including those in the agri-food sector, get access to suitable supports, and the measures in place are being kept under review. </p><p>Working with my colleague Minister Humphreys, I have ensured that 40% of the &euro;250 million COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme will be available for food businesses. Similarly, 40% of an additional &euro;200 million tranche of the Future Growth Loan Scheme will be ring fenced to provide long-term investment support for primary producers and food businesses. I continue to liaise with the banks on liquidity for the primary sector, and also want to highlight the availability of working capital assistance to farmers and fishers through Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan. We will continue to keep the finance needs of the whole agri-food sector under review.</p><p>I have already provided an additional &euro;20m in supports for the beef sector in Budget 2020, on top of the &euro;20 million provided last year for the BEEP pilot. This year&rsquo;s scheme &ndash; the Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme (Sucklers) is a straightforward scheme, which can deliver a significant cash-flow injection,<b></b>and I am pleased to announce that over 27,000 farmers applied by the closing date of 15/05/20.</p><p>Conscious of the cash flow pressures on farms at present, I have brought forward &euro;26m in GLAS payments by a month, and these funds were paid recently.  Balancing payments to participants in the Organic Farming Scheme have also been brought forward.  I have also increased funding in my Department&rsquo;s Calf Welfare Investment Scheme from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million, to assist farmers with extra calves. A range of practical flexibilities have been introduced in departmental schemes, including, for example, the extension of completion deadlines for TAMS by 3 months, and the submission for Nitrates records to the end of June. My Department has also worked to ensure that the supply chain continues to function. Critical state services in dairy and meat processing plants continue to function so that farmers have an outlet for their produce, a protocol has been developed for the continued operation of marts, albeit on a limited basis, and the critical certification and other services required to support exports of live animals and products continue to operate. </p><p>My Department and agencies will continue to monitor the impacts on the agri-food sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector. Senior officials from my Department remain in constant contact with stakeholders right across the sector to share information on emerging issues and contingency planning, and we will continue to develop appropriate supports as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

However, in mid-2019, following assessment of the results of Ireland&rsquo;s 2018 bovine TB Programme, the Commission notified Ireland of its intention to reduce 2018 Programme funding by 10%, or &euro;975,000.</p>  <p>  The Department has engaged extensively with the EU Commission on the matter. While acknowledging that there had been a significantly improved TB situation in Ireland over the past decade, the situation has deteriorated to some extent in 2018 and 2019.  Continuing cooperation between farmers, farm organisations, Private Veterinary Practitioners and the Department will be required to reduce disease spread and more effectively target the high-risk factors associated with bTB transmission,  in order to bring disease trends back on a downward trajectory. </p></reply>

This is a function managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Therefore, the question of compensation does not arise in the context of any schemes or measures introduced by my Department and any issues arising should be directed to my colleague with responsibility for that Department, Minister Madigan. </p>  <p>  Many of these designations are for species or habitats where conservation is also encouraged under various schemes operated by my Department. The GLAS scheme, for example, is Ireland&rsquo;s main agri-environment scheme with close to 50,000 participant farmers. While GLAS is a voluntary scheme, applicants with Commonage or Farmland Habitat on designated land were obligated to include these lands in their application. GLAS participants receive payments for the management of these actions over the five year term of their contract. </p>  <p>  Similarly, some of the EIP/locally-led schemes are also for species or habitats designated such as the &euro;25m hen harrier scheme or the &euro;10m freshwater pearl mussel scheme. These actions and schemes are are a vital part of Ireland's overall environmental obligations and recognise the contribution which farmers can make to achieving these. </p>  <p>  All of these schemes are part of our current Rural Development Programme which is currently closed to new schemes and entrants as the funds are fully committed.  Negotiations are underway at EU level on transitional measures and schemes for 2021 and possibly longer, pending finalisation of the next CAP programme. My Department is already engaged in detailed stakeholder consultation on these issues and on shaping the schemes under the next Programme.</p></reply>

The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP). The Habitats Directive (Article 6.3) requires that where a plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on a Natura site, either individually or in-combination with other plans or projects, it must undergo an appropriate assessment of its implications for that Natura site. The changes now introduced were in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These changes are unavoidable and are largely beyond the control of my Department.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, the situation with regard to felling licences has significantly improved since the start of 2020. Since January, 685 felling licences were issued up to 15th May.  These licences cover over 6,000 ha and a volume in excess of nearly 1.7 million m<sup>3</sup>.  My Department continues to issue new felling licences on a weekly basis.  </p><p>I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and significant resources have been devoted to introducing a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements.  My Department is now meeting those needs as follows:</p><p>- New forestry inspectors and additional administrative staff have been assigned to licensing.

Any livestock mart wishing to engage in limited activities to facilitate the buying and selling of livestock was asked to submit for approval a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) demonstrating to the Department&rsquo;s satisfaction that the individual mart would be in a position to operate in full compliance with HSE guidelines in relation to hygiene and physical distancing. 80 of the 86 licensed marts submitted SOPs, and were approved to operate.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage constructively with marts and representative organisations. at this challenging time. In recent weeks a lot of preparatory work has been done, so that when considered appropriate in the context of the broader approach to Covid-19, further activities in marts can be facilitated while continuing to ensure the safety of mart staff and clients.</p>  <p>  With regard to the financial challenges currently faced by marts, I have engaged with the banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses and have stressed the need for the banks to support and work with their customers through this challenging period. All the banks have announced that they will offer flexibility to their customers, and that they may be able to provide payment breaks or emergency working capital facilities. The advice is that farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses should engage with their bank at an early stage to discuss emerging cash flow issues. I welcomed the recent announcement by Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland that their members, including the five main retail banks, have extended their payment break from three months to six months for those directly impacted by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  In terms of supports, agri-food businesses, including marts, are eligible for the wide range of supports put in place for businesses generally. This includes the National COVID-19 Income Support Scheme, encompassing both the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme and the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. The &euro;250 million SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, co-financed by my Department, has also been deployed to address liquidity and financing needs of eligible businesses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. For smaller businesses of less than 10 employees, Microfinance Ireland is also offering a COVID-19 Business Loan, providing working capital loans up to &euro;50,000. The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS), also co-financed by my Department, was launched last year and made &euro;300m of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses. Loans are competitively priced, for terms of 8-10 years, and support strategic long-term investment. As a result of the significant and sudden financial impact of the pandemic on businesses a second tranche of &euro;200million, with up to 40% available to the agri-food sector, will be made available through the banks, with details to be announced shortly.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has announced agreement of a further suite of measures to further support businesses that are negatively impacted by Covid-19. Work has commenced on a &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs, including agri-businesses, farmers and fishers, for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates. Other measures include a &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver/rebate from 2019; a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses; and the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading, during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue our close engagement with stakeholders across the agri-food in relation to the impact of Covid-19.</p></reply>

I have asked the commissioner to engage with all relevant stakeholders, including local community organisations, Bord na M&oacute;na, ESB, the Midlands Transition Team, Local Authorities, public representatives, and relevant trade unions and workers' representatives.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner will report to Government through me and I have asked him to consider specifically a number of matters in framing his recommendations including: the delivery of the just transition measures provided for in budget 2020; the optimal structures or processes to support co-ordinated and effective delivery, including developing liaison channels between institutions in the region and central Government; the implementation of other actions underway, or planned, by Departments and Agencies that could assist in the just transition; and any additional actions or measures that he considers appropriate for Government consideration. The Commissioner has also been invited to take account of relevant existing plans and programmes such as the Regional Enterprise Plan for the Midlands.</p>  <p>  I received the Commissioner's first progress report at the end of April and, following its consideration by relevant Government Departments, I intend to bring this report to Government and to publish it shortly. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner is undertaking his work on a part time basis, with administrative support provided by my Department. The Commissioner is also being supported in his engagements with stakeholders in the Midlands, as required, by the secretariat to the existing Midlands Regional Transition Team.  I intend to further consider these arrangements in the context of the envisaged ongoing role for the Commissioner in relation to just transition in the Midlands. </p>  <p>  The Government has committed significant resources in 2020, through allocating a portion of the additional carbon tax revenue to be raised on foot of Budget 2020, to measures to support the delivery of an effective just transition for the Midlands. This includes &euro;20 million for a new energy efficiency retrofitting scheme to be focused on the Midlands, &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation outside of the Bord na M&oacute;na estate, and &euro;6 million for a dedicated new just transition fund (with a further &euro;5m coming from ESB in 2020). The Government is also seeking to bring forward appropriate measures to support a much higher level of bog restoration on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs and to provide for a continued role for existing Bord na M&oacute;na workers on these bogs.</p></reply>

Therefore, the project referred to is not eligible to compete in the first RESS auction. For clarity, it is noted that if a project is connecting into another jurisdiction then the grid connection offer would be issued by the relevant system operator in that jurisdiction.  </p>  <p>  The RESS support is linked to the individual project successful in an auction, therefore, support payments are only made for energy produced by RESS projects.

It must also be considered in tandem with other sources of solid fuels used in homes across the country,   to ensure that any measures introduced would be effective in reducing emissions, as well as being fair, reasonable and enforceable. Stakeholder engagement will, therefore, play an important role in any such process.</p>  <p>  A number of measures to improve air quality and reduce emissions from wood burning have already been adopted. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has taken steps to raise the standard of wood used through the voluntary Wood Fuel Quality Assurance Scheme, as better quality wood with a low moisture content tends to have lower emissions.  </p>  <p>  Meanwhile, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has developed standards for solid biofuels, including wood biomass, under Technical Committee (TC) 335 Solid Biofuels, which Ireland has adopted. Although it is not a legal obligation for fuel suppliers to apply this standard, it is strongly recommended that consumers look for fuels meeting the standard when purchasing wood fuels. </p>  <p>  Also at EU level, Ireland supported the introduction of stringent emission standards from solid fuel space heaters under the Eco Design Directive (2009/125/EC). These standards will apply to all new stoves, and must be introduced by the year 2022. A number of manufacturers have already placed a range of &ldquo;Eco Design Stoves&rdquo; on the market.</p>  <p>  As regards the broader issue of Ireland's overall air quality, significant air quality gains will be realised as a consequence of many of the actions contained in the Climate Action Plan. The Department is also currently developing an all-of-Government Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national priorities, as well as EU and other international policy considerations. </p></reply>

It is vital that we ensure the people of rural Ireland have the same opportunities as the people in our towns and cities.</p>  <p>  The Question refers to a premises which is located in the AMBER area on the NBP High Speed Broadband Map which is available on my Department's website at www.broadband.gov.ie. The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). </p>  <p>  All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150Mbps from the outset. By the end of next year, NBI plans to pass approximately 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. </p>  <p>  With regard to the fibre installation close the premises mentioned in the Question, eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and not part of the planned State Intervention network. It is not funded by the State and is not planned, designed or directed by my Department in any capacity. The decision as to what areas and premises are served was made by eir internally and on a commercial basis. My Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that process.</p>  <p>  To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs) are scheduled to be connected to high speed broadband this year. This will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main NBP deployment.  The planned BCP locations, including schools, library hubs and local sports are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie.  It should be noted that some BCP locations may be subject to change. </p>  <p>  These BCPs will leverage the high speed broadband connection through a range of measures and initiatives, for example providing free public Wi-Fi, some will also have hot-desks, and some will be digital hub business centres where digital training, business information events and other SME supports are organised. The BCP delivery project is well underway and surveying of the BCP locations is progressing, which will facilitate detailed design and installation.</p></reply>

LULUCF includes activities associated with forestry, croplands, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other lands. Hedgerows, as landscape features within the cropland and grassland categories, can form part of the emission and removal estimates for these land use categories. It is important to note that emissions and removals of greenhouse gases associated with land based activities are reported in a different category to those associated with agricultural activity, in line with international reporting guidelines.    </p>  <p>  While such emissions are not currently accounted for in relation to the calculation of compliance with Ireland's emissions targets in the period to 2020, from 2021 onwards these emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets.

In that regard, officials from my Department have been engaging intensively with ComReg and with telecommunications industry.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently signed regulations enabling ComReg to release additional rights of use for radio spectrum on a temporary basis. This will provide flexibility for mobile network operators to create additional capacity for mobile phone and broadband services and accommodate the increased demand at this time.</p><p>In addition, on 15th of April 2020, I announced that all major telecommunications providers have committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during Covid 19 including:</p><p>1. Any fixed broadband customers who do not have unlimited usage already as standard will be given the opportunity, if they require, to upgrade their package (which may be on a temporary basis), with their current service provider.</p><p>2. Any customer who does not have fixed broadband and who relies solely on mobile access to the Internet will have the opportunity to avail of affordable unlimited mobile data access/package from their service provider.</p><p>3. Fair usage policies will not be automatically applied to unlimited fixed and mobile data packages.</p><p>4. Service providers may implement appropriate permitted traffic management measures to avoid network congestion.</p><p>5. Access to healthcare and educational resource websites identified by the Government will be zero-rated for all customers where technically feasible.</p><p>6. So that customers can remain connected during the crisis, service providers will engage with any customer that contacts them who is in financial difficulty as a result of Covid-19 and has difficulty paying their bills to agree the best way of keeping them connected to voice and data.</p><p>7. Service Providers will work with ComReg in the event of complaints raised to ComReg by consumers, who consider they are not being treated in accordance with these commitments.</p><p>In addition to these measures, operators have also independently implemented further supports for consumers, with one operator recently announcing a range of packages providing unlimited data while another operator has removed all limits on calls, text and data.</p><p>In relation to energy utilities, the supply of electricity and gas are also vital services for citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives.  Responsibility for the regulation of electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which is an independent regulator under domestic and EU regulatory legislation accountable to a Committee of the Oireachtas.  Among the CRU&rsquo;s responsibilities is that of consumer protection and, given that statutory function, the CRU has pro actively taken several measures to protect domestic consumers in light of the Covid-19 pandemic:</p><p>1. One very significant measure is the temporary moratorium on all domestic electricity and gas disconnections until 16 June 2020, prior to which the CRU will further assess the situation.</p><p>2. Another measure CRU has taken is to increase emergency credit levels for all gas domestic prepayment customers from &euro;10 to &euro;100, as such customers do not have the options that electricity prepayment customers have, to purchase credit online or over the phone.</p><p>3. In general where domestic customers have difficulty paying their electricity or gas bill CRU advises that customers should contact their supplier and seek to come to agreement on a payment plan. The CRU requires suppliers to arrange practical payment plans to assist these customers who have built up arrears and such arrangements must take into account the customer&rsquo;s circumstances and must be reasonable and affordable.</p><p>4. As regards non-domestic customers, CRU has recently implemented a temporary supply suspension scheme for those impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. The scheme is available to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME&rsquo;s) that have been closed due to COVID-19 restrictions. Any customer who opts to enter the scheme will have no energy or network charges billed for their business premises supply point for the duration that the measure is in place.</p><p>To further assist customers who are concerned about paying their electricity or gas bill during this time, CRU has provided a suite of useful information on their website which can be accessed at www.cru.ie/home/about-cru/energy/difficulty-paying-your-bill-covid-19/ and which is updated on an ongoing basis. The CRU has indicated that it is continuing to monitor the market and will take action where appropriate to protect customers.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provide a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions directly to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie<i></i>for timely direct reply.  </p></reply>

They concluded that efforts should be made to improve communication between the local communities and the mine and recommended that these communities should be included in plans for the closure of the mine by 2033, to ensure the delivery of a just transition for the region. The Embassy engaged with national Government, NGO partners, and Cerrej&oacute;n management to share feedback and continue to monitor the situation. </p>  <p>  The Embassy understands that measures have been put in place by Cerrej&oacute;n management to ensure a safe work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, with all bar essential operations ceased.

In that regard, officials from my Department have been engaging intensively with ComReg and with telecommunications industry. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently signed regulations enabling ComReg to release additional rights of use for radio spectrum on a temporary basis. This will provide flexibility for mobile network operators to create additional capacity for mobile phone and broadband services and accommodate the increased demand at this time.</p><p>In addition, on 15th of April 2020, I announced that all major telecommunications providers have committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch, study and work from home during Covid 19 including:</p><p>1. Any fixed broadband customers who do not have unlimited usage already as standard will be given the opportunity, if they require, to upgrade their package (which may be on a temporary basis), with their current service provider.</p><p>2. Any customer who does not have fixed broadband and who relies solely on mobile access to the Internet will have the opportunity to avail of affordable unlimited mobile data access/package from their service provider.</p><p>3. Fair usage policies will not be automatically applied to unlimited fixed and mobile data packages.</p><p>4. Service providers may implement appropriate permitted traffic management measures to avoid network congestion.</p><p>5. Access to healthcare and educational resource websites identified by the Government will be zero-rated for all customers where technically feasible.</p><p>6. So that customers can remain connected during the crisis, service providers will engage with any customer that contacts them who is in financial difficulty as a result of Covid-19 and has difficulty paying their bills to agree the best way of keeping them connected to voice and data.</p><p>7. Service Providers will work with ComReg in the event of complaints raised to ComReg by consumers, who consider they are not being treated in accordance with these commitments.</p><p>In addition to these measures, o  perators have also independently implemented further supports for consumers, with a number of operators recently announcing a range of packages providing unlimited data with one operator removing all limits on calls, text and data.</p><p>Telecommunications service providers, are regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which operates independently of my Department.  The telecommunications regulatory framework which ComReg implements, requires each provider to establish and operate a code of practice, including requirements for complaint handling.  Service Providers must implement these measures, at a minimum, to assist consumers (including businesses) when they need to contact them with a complaint. A copy of the code of practice, which includes the three ways in which consumers can contact service providers, can be accessed at:   .Any operator failing to comply with any of these requirements is a matter to be pursued by ComReg.</p><p>In relation to the use of automated services, the majority of operators use an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to route calls to the relevant customer support area.  Many of the IVRs also advise on the current call waiting times. The majority of operators also offer on-line and web chat functions for speedy resolution of standard queries, in addition to non- automated query handling as appropriate.</p><p>As mentioned above, Service Providers have committed to engaging with any customer that contacts them who is in financial difficulty as a result of Covid-19 and has difficulty paying their bills to agree the best way of keeping them connected to voice and data. Furthermore, Service Providers have also committed to working with ComReg in the event of complaints raised to ComReg by consumers, who consider they are not being treated in accordance with Covid-19 commitments.</p></reply>

Since 2000, approximately 400,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light. Approximately &euro;120 million has been allocated to residential and community energy efficiency schemes in 2020.  The SEAI and Department monitor the impact of the schemes on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  A recently published audit conducted by the European Court of Auditors assessed whether EU co-funded energy efficiency investments in buildings, including under Ireland&rsquo;s Warmer Homes Scheme, had cost-effectively helped the EU toward its 2020 energy saving target.  The primary aim of the Warmer Homes Scheme is to address energy poverty by delivering energy efficiency measures to those homeowners deemed to be in, or at risk of, such poverty.  The programme delivers many benefits to homeowners including improved comfort, quality of life, and health.  Since 2000, the scheme has provided upgrades to over 142,000 homes across Ireland, improving the lives of some of Ireland&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens. The Scheme underwent a significant change in mid-2018, expanding to include more extensive measures, including external wall insulation which is now funded under the scheme. This has resulted in deeper retrofits and greater energy savings for homeowners.  In 2018, 77% of homes upgraded under the scheme saw at least one energy consumption classification change. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the scope of the Court of Auditors report addresses EU funding of the scheme over the period 2014-2018 in terms of energy efficiency only and not other benefits such as energy poverty reductions, which is the primary aim of the scheme.  Furthermore,the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently undertaking a social impact assessment of the SEAI&rsquo;s energy poverty schemes, including the Warmer Homes Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan sets an ambitious target of 500,000 energy efficiency retrofits by 2030.  Achievement of this target will be supported by the Project Ireland 2040 allocation of &euro;3.7 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the Plan.  To deliver our target, a Retrofit Taskforce has been established which will develop a plan to implement a new retrofitting delivery model. The target for development of the plan is Q3 2020.  The audit findings will be considered in the context of the reform and development of energy efficiency schemes.</p></reply>

In this regard F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in conjunction with the relevant authorities, is currently preparing guidelines for the tourism sector.</p>  <p>  Minister Ross and I have appointed a Tourism Recovery Taskforce to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023. The Taskforce may consult with stakeholders to inform its deliberations and report back this year. The membership of the Taskforce is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

One such support is the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.  This Scheme allows employers to continue to pay their employees during the COVID-19 emergency. It aims, as we know, to keep employees registered with their employers, so that they will be able to get back to work quickly after the pandemic.  Shannon Group is availing of this Scheme. </p>  <p>  Details of the suite of Covid-19 Government Funding and Supports available have been notified to Shannon Group, including, the Working Capital Loan Scheme -  a &euro;200m Working Capital scheme for eligible businesses impacted by COVID-19; the Enterprise Support Scheme, under which a &euro;200m package is available from Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Response Plan;  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Support Hub which offers a suite of targeted supports for tourism businesses and a range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Local Enterprise Ireland, grant supports are available to firms to help with strategies to innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness.</p>  <p>  On 13 May 2020, the European Commission published a package of guidelines and recommendations to help Member States gradually lift travel restrictions while respecting necessary health precautions.    Officials in my Department are currently assessing these Guidelines together with further complementary draft guidance developed by the European Aviation Safety Agency. There is an ongoing process of consultation with stakeholders, including Shannon Airport, in the context of providing a means to allow industry to prepare the return to operations as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I fully appreciate and acknowledge the important role of Shannon Airport to the economy of the Midwest region and indeed nationally.  My Department continues to work closely with Shannon Group to ensure that the Company, including Shannon Airport, will be well positioned operationally to contribute to the post pandemic recovery.</p></reply>

My Department is guided by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and national experts in relation to the resumption of services.</p>  <p>  Driving instruction is proved by Instructors who are private individuals either self employed or who are employed by a Driving School.  </p>  <p>  The RSA cannot issue medical guidance to Approved Driving Instructors (ADI) on COVID 19 and how they operate their businesses. As they are not Road Safety Authority (RSA) employees, ADIs should protect themselves, their families and communities by following the official Government guidelines on hygiene and social distancing. As mostly sole traders each ADI has an individual responsibility for their own welfare and that of their families and customers. </p>  <p>  My officials and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) are working together on examining the possibility of resumption of the driving tests and other services as soon as is possible in light of the roadmap published by Government and the National Return to Work Safety Protocol. However, the driving test raises problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol in particular social distancing rules which requires the tester and the candidate to be within a 2 metres distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a confined space, which is not in itself a workspace under the control of the RSA. </p>  <p>  Bearing this in mind, car driver testing may not be able to resume until in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p></reply>

In order to provide early certainty to promoters of licensable events a decision was taken that all licensable events up to the end of August would not proceed.  No decision has yet been taken on sports events, such as the Aer Lingus College Football Classic game scheduled for 29<sup>th</sup>August 2020. Whatever public health advice applies in August will, of course, be abided by. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Businesses</i>, published on 1 May, sets out a gradual and stepped plan for easing the COVID-19 restrictions and returning to social and economic activity.  It is a flexible framework document which is entirely dependent on our success in suppressing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  In line with this Roadmap and its five-phase plan for easing restrictions, it is envisioned that spectator events that involve mass gatherings might be permitted in Phase 5 but &ldquo;only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions and where social distancing can be complied with&rdquo;.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the current position is that visitors from overseas need to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival into Ireland and subsequently abide by the relevant public health advice regarding travel within Ireland.</p></reply>

In many cases where it is not possible to proceed with a wedding reception due to these restrictions, the couple and the hotel will be able to agree on an alternative date and the question of a refund will not arise.  </p><p>Where a couple have placed a deposit with a hotel or other wedding venue, they have entered into a contract with the hotel or venue concerned. Whether a couple are entitled to a refund of their deposit where it is not possible to reschedule the wedding will depend in the first instance on the terms and conditions of their contract.  Couples who find themselves in this situation should first check the terms and conditions of their contract with the hotel or venue, and in particular the terms relating to cancellations and the refund of deposits and other pre-payments. If a term of the contract provides for the refund of deposits in the event of a cancellation, the business may not subsequently change that term without the consumer&rsquo;s agreement.  While I fully appreciate that hotels are facing severe financial pressures at present, they should deal fairly with consumers who find it necessary to cancel contracts for weddings or other functions and are seeking a refund of their deposits.  </p><p>The terms of standard form contracts of the kind that typically govern weddings and other functions are subject to assessment for unfairness under the Regulations on unfair terms in consumer contracts.  The aim of the Regulations is to protect consumers against the abuse of power by sellers and suppliers, in particular by means of one-sided contract terms. The Regulations provide for example that among the terms that may be regarded as unfair are terms that permit sellers or suppliers to retain sums paid by the consumer where the latter decides not to perform the contract without providing for the consumer to receive compensation of an equivalent amount from the seller or supplier where the latter is the party cancelling the contract.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of the Regulations on the control of unfair terms in standard form consumer contracts.  Information on matters relating to consumer contracts, including on cancellations and refunds for wedding and other contracts, can be accessed on the CCPC website at <i></i>.</p><p>The enormous disruption to commercial activity caused by Covid-19 has thrown up many difficult situations for consumers and businesses. If current consumer law proves not to have provided adequate protection for consumers in these situations, I will consider and, where justified, bring forward proposals to strengthen that law where I can do so without contravening EU consumer protection legislation. Later this year I will publish the Scheme of a comprehensive, consolidated Consumer Rights Bill that will set out rights and remedies for consumer contracts for goods, services, digital content and will include proposals to strengthen the existing provisions on unfair terms in consumer contracts. This Bill will provide an opportunity to address any gaps in consumer protection revealed by the application by businesses of the terms of consumer contracts in cases arising from Covid-19.</p></reply>

The purpose of the driving test is to set out the minimum level of knowledge, skill and competency that a learner must demonstrate in order to become a fully licensed driver. Until a learner can meet this standard and pass this test, they are not safe to take to our roads without appropriate supervision.  Hence the support that learner drivers need now is the same as it always has been - learning to drive with an experienced driver alongside.</p>  <p>  The driving test, like other public services provided by the Road Safety Authority (RSA), has been temporarily closed for public health reasons during the COVID crisis. </p>  <p>  The RSA undertook the appropriate risk assessments and is satisfied that it cannot, bearing in mind its responsibility for the health and safety of its employees and the general public,, undertake category B (car) driving tests on an emergency basis at this time.  In particular, a driver tester would be required to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes. They have looked at a number of approaches to mitigate this but have not identified a means to do within the public health guidance in force, and regrettably they have been unable to carry out car driving tests on an emergency basis.</p>  <p>  However, it may be possible to carry out driving tests in other categories of vehicles, like ambulances or buses, and the RSA assesses these on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of public services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publications of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safely Protocol agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  Until a date has been agreed with the relevant authorities whereby driver testing can be carried out safely and in accordance with the public health requirements, there is little point in providing provisional test dates.  The RSA has always provided urgent tests where the circumstances warrant it, and I expect this to be the case when the service is allowed to re-open. </p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p></reply>

The NTA has therefore taken action to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators and to make it easier for them to return to the industry when circumstances change. </p>  <p>  The NTA has engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those SPSV operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. Operators who avail of this facility will be able to either reduce their monthly premium or receive a refund from their insurer, depending on their individual arrangements with their insurer. </p>  <p>  To avail of this insurance reduction, SPSV operators must temporarily suspend their SPSV licences. Since the start of April about 5% of SPSV licences have been suspended. The suspension of a licence requires the removal and return of a vehicle&rsquo;s tamper-proof discs to the NTA in accordance with section 17 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013. A tamper-proof disc is evidence that an SPSV is genuine with a valid licence and appropriate insurance. It would therefore be inappropriate for an SPSV to display such a disc if its licence and insurance was suspended.</p>  <p>  The NTA is keen to facilitate the swift return to work of any SPSV operator who wishes to reactivate their licence following a temporary suspension.  I am informed that the NTA has a team available nationwide to reapply tamper-proof discs free of charge, that the process takes only minutes, and that a suitability inspection will not be required to apply duplicate tamper-proof discs to an SPSV.</p></reply>

Their situation is made particularly difficult as they are not in receipt of refunds from suppliers and future bookings have all but ceased.</p>  <p>  The idea behind the Refund Credit Note is that the tour operators/travel agents may offer customers the option of the Note, which can then be used to book a future holiday or redeemed for cash at a later date.  Importantly the customer may still opt for a cash refund, but if they accept the Refund Credit Note, it will work as follows:</p>  <p>  1.

The purpose of this group is to provide support to the tourism industry and to facilitate the timely sharing of information and insights to help improve the sector's understanding and response to the crisis.

In this regard F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in conjunction with the relevant authorities, is currently preparing guidelines for the tourism sector.</p>  <p>  Minister Ross and I have appointed a Tourism Recovery Taskforce to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023. The Taskforce may consult with stakeholders to inform its deliberations and report back this year. The membership of the Taskforce is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Their goal is to make bus transport faster and more reliable, thereby encouraging more people to switch from private cars to public transport. This will achieve the twin goals of reducing congestion and reducing pollution.</p>  <p>  In addition to buses, bus lanes may also be used by cyclists who, as vulnerable road users, are safer in bus lanes than in general traffic. The lanes may also, of course, be used by the emergency services. </p>  <p>  After the lanes were originally introduced it was decided to allow taxis to use them. This was a concession based on the fact that taxis are a form of public transport available for on-street hire, like buses, unlike private hire limousines. </p>  <p>  Since bus lanes were first introduced, there have been many requests to allow other classes of traffic to use the lanes. These have included requests on behalf of motorcyclists, multi-occupancy vehicles, electric vehicles, hired limousines, hackneys, and animal ambulances, among others. My predecessors and I have always rejected these requests. Any addition to them would reduce the quality and level of service for the ordinary commuter travelling by bus.  In addition, it would not enhance the safety of the cyclists using bus lanes.</p></reply>

Licence categories were then changed, with separate categories covering car (Category B) and car and trailer (Category BE).  People licensed to drive with trailer before 1989 were allowed to keep their old entitlements, simply by indicating this wish on the application form when renewing their licences. </p>  <p>  Where a pre-1989 licence holder did not indicate that they wished to retain the entitlement, the category was not included on the renewed licence.  However, the entitlement could be restored up to ten years after last holding it.  If the entitlement to drive with a trailer was allowed to lapse for longer than the ten years, the person was required to apply as a learner for the purposes of driving with a trailer. </p>  <p>  People who have a Category B licence, and who wish to acquire a Category BE licence, do not have to wait the usual 6 months before they can take the Category BE test.  This change came into effect as of 10 January 2012. It is of the utmost importance, from a safety perspective, that people are properly qualified and licensed to drive the vehicles they have charge of on our roads, taking account of the particular risks and hazards associated with the particular categories they wish to drive.</p></reply>

This is of course a concerning time for everyone in tourism. Minister Griffin and I have established an appropriate taskforce of industry, agency and departmental expertise tasked with producing a Tourism Recovery Plan. This plan will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can recover in the changed tourism environment following the Covid-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  In common with other sectors, tourism businesses are also availing of the wide range of Government supports put in place to respond to this crisis. My Department is continuing to liaise with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and industry representative bodies, to align the economy wide COVID-19 supports and initiatives with tourism and hospitality needs.</p></reply>

Measures introduced by the Government to date, which have benefitted national sporting organisations and their local sports clubs, include: </p>  <p>  - the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme; </p>  <p>  - the Pandemic Unemployment Payment; and </p>  <p>  - a series of enterprise supports including liquidity funding, loan schemes and grants\vouchers, as well as deferred tax payments and deferral of commercial rates. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties and challenges facing sporting organisations. A COVID-19 Sports Monitoring Group, chaired at Ministerial level, has been established to engage directly with the sporting bodies. Sport Ireland is also directly engaging with the sporting bodies on an ongoing basis in relation to the development of protocols to facilitate a safe return to training and competition.</p>  <p>  This extensive engagement with the sport sector has highlighted the significant, adverse impact of COVID-19 and the importance of implementing an appropriate and focused response to the challenges facing all strands of the sector, ranging from the local sporting organisations and clubs to the National Governing Bodies. It is accordingly intended to develop a Sport Recovery Action Plan, in consultation with the sector, aimed at minimising the impacts and preparing the sector to restart activity, as part of the national recovery and renewal.</p></reply>

As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no licence category for them. Therefore their use is strictly prohibited on public roads and in public places. Any changes to this require primary legislation would be a matter for a new Government to decide.</p>  <p>  Before legislating for the use of PPTS there should be appropriate infrastructure in place that does not endanger either other vulnerable road users or those using PPTs.</p>  <p>  In the current context, in several jurisdictions it has been noted that there were significant increases in demand on accident and emergency medical facilities due to PPTs. This would not be advisable here given the ongoing demands on our health service due to the Covid 19 pandemic and so any change that may create such additional demands would also have to be subject to consideration from that wider public health viewpoint.</p></reply>

Self-employed owner operators of SPSVs may also avail of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment of &euro;350 a week. </p>  <p>  I recognise that demand for SPSV services is particularly reliant on the tourism and hospitality sector, and since the onset of the Covid-19 Emergency and the introduction of restrictions as part of the necessary public health response, passenger demand for SPSV services has fallen radically and many SPSV operators have stopped working. The NTA has therefore taken action to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators and to make it easier for them to return to the industry when circumstances change.</p>  <p>  The NTA has extended licences expiring before 12 June 2020 by three months, waived late licence renewal fees, and temporarily relaxed rules around vehicle age limits. The NTA has also engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those SPSV operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. Operators who suspend their licences will be able to either reduce their monthly premium or receive a refund from their insurer, depending on their individual arrangements with their insurer.</p>  <p>  Finally, the transfer of SPSV licences, as suggested by the Deputy, is prohibited under section 14(1) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, uptake for the scheme among early learning and care and school aged care providers was much lower than expected, and so the scheme had to be cancelled.</p>  <p>  In commenting on the reasons for low take-up of the scheme by childcare providers, childcare provider organisations have referred to the lack of insurance cover for Covid-19 related claims which could be taken against them; to concerns about the difficulty of supporting staff remotely and lack of control of the environment in which their staff would be working; and the inability to provide staff with fixed lunch and rest breaks without any ongoing responsibility for the care of children.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that there were indeed challenges to the scheme from the beginning, however, my Department, refusing to take a risk averse position in unprecedented times, worked hard to make a scheme available. I believe that discussions about this scheme has assisted services, staff and my Department to focus on the obstacles that need to be addressed to facilitate services beginning a phased re-opening from 29 June. </p>  <p>  Since the cancellation of the scheme, there has been progress with regard to insurance. The primary insurer in the childcare sector has agreed that Covid-19 related claims will not be excluded from policies for services which reopen from 29 June. In terms of addressing the public health fears of the sector, the opening of other sectors on 18 May ,and recent research suggesting  that children may play only a minor role in spreading the virus,  should help to reduce childcare practitioners&rsquo; fears.</p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The Roadmap proposes the gradual re-opening of ELC/SAC services across all Phases. The Roadmap references a number of possible scenarios therein, including those referenced by the Deputy of some services re-opening for one day per week, for example. I would note however that the Roadmap provides a pathway towards re-opening rather than the detailed policies for re-opening.</p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy around capacity. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, </p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and development needs and for ELC and  SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred</p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for preschool children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. </p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given  likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. </p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every ELC and SAC service  around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  </p>  <p>  I hope the Deputy can appreciate that the issues raised are under consideration but that I cannot provide more detail at this time while proposals are in development. I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.</p></reply>

The re-opening of ELC and SAC services will be guided by public health advice  first and foremost, in accordance with the phases announced by the Government recently. </p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS), launched by my Department on 15 April, builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the childcare sector. The TWSCS layers on the  Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and operates in tandem to this scheme.  Hence, any decisions by the Department regarding the TWSCS will therefore be guided by Government decisions regarding the TWSS in the first instance. For the present, the TWSCS will run in parallel with Revenue operated TWSS to support the particular circumstances of this sector and to ensure that, once this crisis passes, ELC and SAC services will be in a position to re-open and return to their important work.</p>  <p>  A number of supports were available before COVID to improve the sustainability of services during normal times. These remain available now ; and it is expected that this will continue as normal when services can safely reopen. Financial supports are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  My Department has begun to consider whether this sustainability funding can be extended to private services during the pandemic. However, I hope the Deputy can appreciate that our immediate focus is the administration of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme which is in itself a significant sustainability measure, and to address  other urgent issues.</p>  <p>  My Department has made considerable investment in the sector in recent years. I want to preserve the fruits of this investment and I want to ensure that the ELC and SAC places are still there for parents when they are past these difficult times.</p></reply>

The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism, having regard to the best interests of children and to the needs of the most economically vulnerable. Those with the least income will get the highest subsidy<b>.  </b>Higher subsidies will be awarded to families with younger children, to reflect the higher cost of providing childcare for younger children because of the higher adult-child ratios required by the Early Years Regulations. We will also aim to support education, training and employment as routes out of poverty.</p><p>The intention behind the &lsquo;savers&rsquo; provision for the legacy schemes you mention was to ensure that no one would lose out in the initial transition to the Scheme, so families could remain on their current entitlements until they were no longer eligible or until they no longer required childcare.</p><p>By replacing the legacy schemes, including CCS/P, the NCS will increase the number of families who can avail of subsidised childcare, and remove many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to appropriately incentivise employment and education / training for parents. </p><p>Under Budget 2020, I negotiated additional funding to further enhance the NCS. The maximum number of subsidised hours available under the Scheme will increase from September 2020. Enhanced awards (for parents who are working, studying or training) will increase from 40 to 45 hours per week, and standard awards (for parents who are not working, studying or training) will increase from 15 to 20 hours per week. These measures are targeted at supporting children whose parents are not in work or study, and also working families needing school age childcare. They also respond to concerns expressed by one parent groups.</p><p>I would finally note that my Department will be continually monitoring the scheme and will examine any adjustments which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents.  In this regard, it should be emphasised that the NCS has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.</p></reply>

While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy around capacity. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  - Minimising  the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, </p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and      development needs and for ELC and SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred</p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for preschool children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as      the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child      ratios. </p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring  a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas.

Unfortunately, uptake for the scheme among early learning and care and school aged care providers was much lower than expected, and so the scheme had to be cancelled.</p>  <p>  In commenting on the reasons for low take-up of the scheme by childcare providers,  childcare provider organisations have referred to the lack of insurance cover for Covid-19 related claims which could be taken against them; to concerns about the difficulty of supporting staff remotely and lack of control of the environment in which their staff would be working; and the inability to provide staff with fixed lunch and rest breaks without any ongoing responsibility for the care of children.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that there were indeed challenges to the scheme from the beginning, however, my Department, refusing to take a risk averse position in unprecedented times, worked hard to make a scheme available.  I believe that discussions about this scheme has assisted services, staff and my Department to focus on the obstacles that need to be addressed to facilitate services beginning a phased re-opening from 29 June. </p>  <p>  Since the cancellation of the scheme, there has been progress with regard to insurance. The primary insurer in the childcare sector has agreed that Covid-19 related claims will not be excluded from policies for services which reopen from 29 June. In terms of addressing the public health fears of the sector, the opening of other sectors on 18 May ,and recent research suggesting  that children may play only a minor role in spreading the virus,  should help to reduce childcare practitioners&rsquo; fears.</p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC/SAC services are stated as follows: </p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. </p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. </p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy around capacity. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, and the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and development needs.</p>  <p>  -Providing early learning and childcare for preschool children, meeting parental demand for early learning and childcare as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for early learning and childcare before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified early learning and childcare practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention. </p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government.</p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every ELC and SAC service  around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months. I am committed to ensuring as far as is practicable that COVID does not add to the affordability issues already being experienced with regard to childcare in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.</p></reply>

The phase re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services. </p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government.</p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the fact that the public health situation might lead to reduced capacity in childcare services, which may create pressures for parents returning to work. My Department is working with the childcare sector on the phased provision of early learning and care and school-age childcare to ensure that services can re-open safely and support parents as effectively as possible. Where parents are making other arrangements for care, I would urge them to adhere to the latest public health advice from the HSE in doing so.</p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.</p></reply>

This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy around capacity. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, </p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and      development needs and for ELC and SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred</p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for preschool children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as      the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. </p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with  higher fees.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. </p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every ELC and SAC around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  </p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.</p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the importance of the ELC and SAC sector for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.</p>  <p>  Recognising this, I launched the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) on 15 April. This scheme is a very significant measure to support the sector. The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: </p>  <p>  - to support the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p>  <p>  - to provide parents with a reassurance that if their ELC and SAC provider signs up to the scheme, they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, and they will maintain their ELC / SAC place when services resume and</p>  <p>  - to give Early Learning and Care practitioners security and to retain these vital Educators in the sector. </p>  <p>  The TWSCS is a supplement to the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), to enhance its provisions for the particular needs of the ELC and SAC sector. It is effective from 6 April 2020 for services who have signed up and completed the necessary application process.</p>  <p>  The TWSCS provides participating service providers with a payment to be used towards ongoing overhead costs. This payment is backdated to 6 April 2020. </p>  <p>  The TWSCS also provides payments to top-up wages of eligible ELC and SAC staff, supplementing the subsidy provided under the TWSS. In line with the Revenue guidance on their scheme, the TWSS cannot be applied retrospectively. An employer must not amend a payroll submission already reported to Revenue in order to qualify for the scheme. However, where ELC and SAC providers have provided top-ups to the maximum additional payment an employer can make to receive full wage subsidy under the Revenue scheme, and this is reflected on payrolls submitted to Revenue since 6 April 2020, my Department will reimburse the providers for these additional payments.</p></reply>

The report was submitted to the Board of Management of Oberstown in February 2017 and to me in March 2017.</p>  <p>  The Board of Oberstown took independent legal advice on the question of publication of the review, which stated that there were legal risks around publication. Following careful examination, the Board was not in a position to satisfy itself, or me, that fair procedures had been applied before the report was finalised and submitted. In light of the legal risks associated with publication, the Board, with great reluctance, decided not to publish the report. The Board considered it necessary to strike the balance between the public interest in publishing the report and avoiding the substantial legal risks associated with such publication. The Board published the recommendations of the review in full, together with a detailed Board response to each recommendation.</p>  <p>  I also sought the advice of the Attorney General, who advised that publication of the report was fraught with legal risk. Following detailed consideration of the complex matters involved I concluded that it was not appropriate to publish the full report. This remains the position. </p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The future phases of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC/SAC services are stated as follows: </p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. </p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. </p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for swift action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will allow for sufficient time and planning to make best use of public funding to support the safe and sustainable re-opening of the sector. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to enable as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing and costing proposals for reopening in line with the Roadmap.

In recognition of the whole of government approach required, in July 2018, the Taoiseach launched the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19. The Action Plan involves a wide range of actions, across six Government Departments &ndash; Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health; and Business Enterprise and Innovation, recognising that online safety is not the responsibility of just one Department and signifying the range and breadth of the issues involved. </p>  <p>  Children First operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs committed to amending the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the completion of a Child Safeguarding Statement. An addendum to the Guidance, clarifying the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements, was finalised and published on the Department&rsquo;s website in January 2019. In addition, Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.</p>  <p>  As part of the government response to Covid-19, in late April, I as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs launched a range of supports for parents and children to support them during this challenging time. The first initiative is a new online gov.ie resource for parents, entitled &lsquo;Parents Centre&rsquo;, which brings together high quality information and online resources for parents into one portal. Parents Centre provides links to a wide variety of material including around learning, parenting and supports that are available. It also includes links to Webwise, an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills, which is the key internet safety online access point for parents in Ireland.  As a response to Covid-19, the Webwise Parents Hub has recently been updated with online safety advice for parents, including around screen time as well as with the publication of &lsquo;A Parent&rsquo;s Guide for a Better Internet&rsquo;, covering topics including managing technology use at home, social networking tips and dealing with cyberbullying.</p>  <p>  The second initiative is &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s Play Ireland&rsquo;, an online portal on gov.ie, providing access to a range of play resources for children. It is intended that the ideas on the website will encourage parents to support their children to use their imagination including ideas on how to use resources that can be found at home. The portal contains a section on screen time which includes tips for families on how to find a reasonable balance between time spent on screens and time for other types of play and activities, including family time. Additional resources will be continually developed and added to the &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s Play Ireland&rsquo; portal.</p>  <p>Computer apps and games, and in-app purchases on games and apps, are subject to the provisions of general consumer protection legislation which is the responsibility of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. I have been informed by her Department that Directive (EU) 2019/770 on contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services (the &lsquo;Digital Content Directive&rsquo;) introduces new protections for consumers and sets out a range of quality and other requirements with which digital content and digital services must comply along with remedies for consumers where these requirements are not met. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation will transpose the Directive into Irish law by 1st July 2021 and the legislation will come into force with effect from 1st January 2022.</p></reply>

This scheme is a very significant measure to support the sector and reflects the particular impact the pandemic has had on early education and childcare providers.</p>  <p>I can confirm that as of 18 May, 3,815 childcare providers have signed up to participate in the TWSCS &ndash; this represents 84% of childcare providers. The TWSCS continues to remain open to providers to continue to sign up to and apply for supports under the TWSCS.</p>  <p>  The Department, and Pobal on behalf of the Department, continues to engage with the childcare sector in order to assist and inform providers on the TWSCS. For example, the Department has issued a Frequently Asked Questions document to assist providers in their understanding of the TWSCS and Pobal has issued a number of communications on the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP) to providers outlining the operation of and application process for the TWSCS.</p>  <p>  In addition, Pobal  operates an Early Years Provider Centre to respond to any queries that providers may have in relation to the TWSCS. The only substantive feedback received thus far has been with regard to clarification on certain scheme elements, such as interaction with the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. DCYA has worked with partners to address key issues and guidance material has been updated accordingly.</p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC/SAC services are stated as follows: </p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. </p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. </p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy around capacity. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, </p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and      development needs and for ELC and SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred</p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for preschool children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. </p>  <p>   -Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. </p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every early education and childcare service  around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  </p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.</p></reply>

This funding is allocated to the LAGs for the full period of the programme.</p><p>The remaining &euro;25 million is available for thematic schemes to be delivered at a national level and is allocated as projects are approved.  </p><p>Table 1 below provides details of all payments made to the LAGs on an annual basis.</p><p>Table 2 below provides details of:</p><p>- The budget allocations to the LAGs under the LEADER 2014-2020 programme, and</p><p>- The total spend by the LAGs broken down by:</p><p>- the cost of developing their Local Development Strategies at the outset of the programme (preparatory support); </p><p>- expenditure incurred on administration and on supporting the development of LEADER projects (administration &amp;amp; animation);</p><p>- funding provided to LEADER projects; and</p><p>- total spend expressed as a percentage of each LAG's budget allocation.</p><p>While the overall spend to date is 43% of the total allocation available to the LAGs, there continues to be a consistent increase in project payments over previous years. Over 1,400 project promoters, or 50%, have now received a Final Payment in respect of their project.  </p><p>Project approvals have also steadily increased, with 2,911 projects approved to date to a value of over &euro;112 million.  A further 401 projects, requesting funding of almost &euro;28 million, are at earlier stages in the approvals process.Project payments under the programme will continue to increase as approved works are completed and claims for payment submitted.  Payments can continue to be made beyond the 2014-2020 LEADER programming period in respect of projects approved before the end of 2020.</p><p>The figures provided do not include payments made under thematic schemes which are funded outside of the core budget allocated to each LAG. </p><p>Table 1: LEADER

With the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the measures we have had to take in response to the spread of Covid-19.  Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it must be difficult for Debenhams workers to now face redundancy.  I applaud their efforts to ensure that they get the best outcome possible from the situation.  I wish to assure the affected workers that my Department is available through its Intreo service to assist them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  I want to assure everybody that the my Department is assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.  Indeed over the past number of weeks officials from my Department have engaged with both officials from Mandate and with the Human Resource management team in Debenhams to ensure that all workers have received their due entitlements from my Department.  </p>  <p>  My officials are also available to assist these workers in the job search efforts over the period ahead and with advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors where work opportunities will become available as the economy improves over the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the redundancy and insolvency section of my Department has already engaged with the liquidators appointed to Debenhams and is continuing to work with them to ensure that all claims in respect of employees are dealt with expeditiously.</p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the liquidation of Debenhams there have been calls on the Government to intervene in or halt the liquidation of the company and to ensure that employees of Debenhams receive enhanced redundancy payments.  Employee representatives have also called for the 30 day mandatory consultation period to be extended.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been clear that she, as the Minister responsible for company law legislation, has no statutory power to intervene in a court supervised liquidation.  A company is permitted to initiate a voluntary winding up where it has complied with requirements of the Companies Act 2014.</p>  <p>  I have been asked by the Mandate Trade Union to utilise my powers in accordance with Section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  In this regard, I sought urgent legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to those powers as they pertain to a court appointed liquidator.  I received those advices yesterday and they are unequivocal. </p>  <p>  I am advised that I, as Minister, cannot exercise the powers in section 15 because those powers envisage engagement only with the employer.  As is clear from the statutory definition, a liquidator is not an employer for the purposes of this Act.  Therefore, there is no possibility of using the section 15 mechanism as suggested. </p>  <p>  While we don&rsquo;t have the power to ensure that Debenhams pay an enhanced redundancy package to its employees, an employer is obliged to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement as provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and that is all that can be legally enforced against an employer. </p>  <p>  As the company has been declared insolvent, the Department can provide a safety net for employees and the liquidator can submit claims for statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.  We will ensure that the statutory redundancy entitlement which is laid out in legislation will be paid.</p></reply>

The scheme is operated by the Revenue Commissioners and enables eligible employees, whose employers&rsquo; business activities have experienced significant negative disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to receive supports directly from their employer. It also ensures that employers retain employees during the pandemic in order to facilitate the business&rsquo; operations in getting back to normal once the crisis eases. The subsidy scheme is implemented by employers through their payroll system, with employees receiving the subsidy payment along with any other payments made by the employer.  It is a condition of this scheme that individuals cannot receive my Department&rsquo;s Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment at the same time as receiving payments under the Revenue TWSS or DCYA TWSCS.</p>  <p>  The One Parent Family Parent, a means tested payment and Working Family Payment  an income assessed payment take account of any earnings received by claimants.  This includes any amounts received by way of Revenue TWSS payments.  </p>  <p>  Childcare workers who are in receipt of the one parent family payment or the working family payment will continue to receive these payments during their temporary lay-off as a result of the Covid-19 related closures provided they continue to meet the eligibility conditions for these schemes. </p>  <p>  It is open to any customer who considers that their circumstances have changed to request a review of their claim. If this results in an increased rate of payment, this increase will be backdated accordingly.  A reduction in a rate of payment is normally only applied from a current date, unless there is evidence that a customer knowingly misled the Department or failed to report a change in their circumstances. </p>  <p>   I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Victims of domestic violence accommodation needs are met through this joined-up service delivery model provided by Tusla with the close involvement of the various housing authorities nationwide. </p>  <p>  A housing authority can provide, on a humanitarian basis, short-term emergency housing to persons who are unable to return to their homes because of domestic violence without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s waiting list for housing supports.  </p>  <p>  Generally, where a victim is not seeking to return to the family home, a social housing assessment by the housing authority is the appropriate response. Assessments should be conducted in a timely manner to ensure that victims do not end up residing in emergency accommodation, including refuge facilities, for long periods of time. Once a customer has successfully completed a housing needs assessment, they can then apply for HAP.</p>  <p>  As part of this response, Tusla funds and supports over 40 organisations providing support services to victims of domestic violence, including 20 refuges providing safe specialist emergency domestic violence accommodation. Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services, and in particular, Domestic Violence refuges have been identified as one of Tusla&rsquo;s three highest priority services in its crisis management responses to the period of Covid-19 public health measures. A range of supports have been put in place to assure continuity of essential services and there is ongoing systematic engagement between Tusla and service provider organisations around emerging needs.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of HAP, Rent Supplement continues to revert to original role of providing short-term support to those who have become temporarily unemployed and require income support to meet their tenancy cost whilst they seek alternative employment.  Rent supplement, by virtue of its short-term nature and its targeted customer cohort, is not considered the principal solution in meeting the accommodation needs of those fleeing domestic or sexual violence, in particular where, following a Housing Needs Assessment, HAP is an available option. </p>  <p>  There are no indications within my department that the rent supplement scheme is operating in a way that is preventing victims of domestic violence from getting the support they need, and Community Welfare Officers are using the full flexibility of the scheme to assist those in need during the current crisis.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, my department does provide support to customers of domestic violence. Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA), Exceptional Needs Payments (ENP) / Urgent Needs Payments (UNP) are available to meet essential once-off cost for customers who are unable to meet these out of their own resources. Where a person&rsquo;s safety and well-being are at risk due to domestic violence, department officials operating SWA have discretionary powers to provide ENPs / UNPs to address the person&rsquo;s immediate needs. It is expected that whilst the Department is providing support, the person concerned can transition safely to the relevant agencies and supports that provide the tailored support that they require.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to liaise with their colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs / Tusla, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government to ensure that victims of domestic violence have appropriate supports including access to local authority sponsored housing via HAP.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have a particular case in mind I would ask him/her to share the details with me and I will have it assessed without delay.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

This emergency payment was introduced to support persons aged between 18 and up to 66 years old who have lost their employment due to the downturn in economic activity caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and where they are not being paid by their employer. In order to qualify for the payment a person must have been in employment on or after the 6th March. The conditions around the payment to self-employed people are that they must have experienced a collapse of income and be available to take up other full-time work if it was available to them in order to qualify.</p>  <p>  People who do not meet these conditions may be eligible for support under the social insurance based jobseekers benefit schemes or the means tested jobseekers allowance scheme depending on their individual circumstances. People who are already in receipt of a jobseekers payment, which may include substitute teachers and exam invigilators, who were not employed on 6 March will continue to remain on this payment for as long as they are entitled to it.</p>  <p>  Where a person is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for financial support Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The scheme is operated by the Revenue Commissioners and enables eligible employees, whose employers&rsquo; business activities have experienced significant negative disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to receive supports directly from their employer. It also ensures that employers retain employees during the pandemic in order to facilitate the business&rsquo; operations in getting back to normal once the crisis eases. The subsidy scheme is implemented by employers through their payroll system, with employees receiving the subsidy payment along with any other payments made by the employer. The employer, however, is not entitled to the money in their own right and it cannot be used for any other purpose other than in accordance with the conditions of the scheme.</p>  <p>   It is a condition of the scheme that individuals cannot receive my Department&rsquo;s Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment at the same time as receiving payments under the Revenue TWSS.  However, it cannot be the case that employees are prevented from accessing financial support at this critical time by the actions or inactions of their employer. Accordingly, the individuals covered by the Deputy&rsquo;s question should apply for my Department&rsquo;s Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment if they have not already done so. Where arrears arise these will be processed in due course and individuals will be notified of the outcome.  In line with all other cases where arrears entitlements may exist, my Department is committed to reviewing cases as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

With the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the measures we have had to take in response to the spread of Covid-19.  Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it must be difficult for Debenhams workers to now face redundancy.  I applaud their efforts to ensure that they get the best outcome possible from the situation.  I wish to assure the affected workers that my Department is available through its Intreo service to assist them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  I want to assure everybody that the my Department is assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.  Indeed over the past number of weeks officials from my Department have engaged with both officials from Mandate and with the Human Resource management team in Debenhams to ensure that all workers have received their due entitlements from my Department.  </p>  <p>  My officials are also available to assist these workers in the job search efforts over the period ahead and with advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors where work opportunities will become available as the economy improves over the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the redundancy and insolvency section of my Department has already engaged with the liquidators appointed to Debenhams and is continuing to work with them to ensure that all claims in respect of employees are dealt with expeditiously.</p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the liquidation of Debenhams there have been calls on the Government to intervene in or halt the liquidation of the company and to ensure that employees of Debenhams receive enhanced redundancy payments.  Employee representatives have also called for the 30 day mandatory consultation period to be extended.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been clear that she, as the Minister responsible for company law legislation, has no statutory power to intervene in a court supervised liquidation.  A company is permitted to initiate a voluntary winding up where it has complied with requirements of the Companies Act 2014.</p>  <p>  I have been asked by the Mandate Trade Union to utilise my powers in accordance with Section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  In this regard, I sought urgent legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to those powers as they pertain to a court appointed liquidator.  I received those advices yesterday and they are unequivocal. </p>  <p>  I am advised that I, as Minister, cannot exercise the powers in section 15 because those powers envisage engagement only with the employer.  As is clear from the statutory definition, a liquidator is not an employer for the purposes of this Act.  Therefore, there is no possibility of using the section 15 mechanism as suggested. </p>  <p>  While we don&rsquo;t have the power to ensure that Debenhams pay an enhanced redundancy package to its employees, an employer is obliged to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement as provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and that is all that can be legally enforced against an employer. </p>  <p>  As the company has been declared insolvent, the Department can provide a safety net for employees and the liquidator can submit claims for statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.  We will ensure that the statutory redundancy entitlement which is laid out in legislation will be paid.</p></reply>

In order to assist customers, all aspects that would facilitate the processing of claims and provisions of payments were considered, both within existing payment scenarios and taking into account the introduction of new social distancing requirements.</p>  <p>  In response to the crisis, on 20 March a letter was issued to a small number of customers in Inishowen, Co.

The terms and conditions of individual employment contracts may provide additional specifics within those parameters such as stipulations in relation to the taking of minimum blocks of leave and the timing of leave. </p>  <p>  Section 20 of the Act of 1997 in essence provides that the employer determines the timing of an employee&rsquo;s annual leave, taking into consideration work and personal requirements.  It also provides that the employer should consult the employee or the relevant trade union at least one month in advance. </p>  <p>  Workers and employers, most of whom have now been engaging for several weeks in reaching reasonable arrangements and accommodations in the current extraordinary circumstances, are encouraged to continue doing so in a constructive manner.  Complaints in relation to employers attempting to impose more restrictive terms than are provided by statute or in the terms and conditions of the individual employment contract should be made to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  It is understood that the strong legislative provisions already in place allow sufficient flexibility for employees and employers to navigate current events in the context of annual leave and, therefore, no legislative amendments are proposed at this juncture.  </p>  <p>  My Department continuously monitors existing employment rights legislation to ensure that it continues to be relevant and fit for purpose and is updated to reflect international developments at European Union, Court of Justice and International Labour Organisation level. </p>  <p>  Where any new legislation is proposed, my Department engages in extensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders, to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the rights of workers and the interests of business.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The on-going payment of Mortgage Interest Supplement did not address the long term housing challenges for people in serious mortgage arrears; and,</p>  <p>  2. The Central Bank's Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides for an appropriate framework for customers, with the responsibility of forbearance for a customer&rsquo;s Mortgage difficulties resting with the mortgage service provider. </p>  <p>  Any change to this decision would need to be considered in the overall budgetary and policy context. The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported remains through on-going engagement with their lender to explore a sustainable and appropriate response from their lending institution. </p>  <p>  Under the CCMA (2013), measures and policies are in place to support customers in financial difficulty with their mortgage commitments.  The CCMA is issued by the Central Bank under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and ensures that the responsibility of forbearance remains with the mortgage service provider. </p>  <p>  The CCMA provides support for those that are in arrears, pre-arrears or those who fall under scope of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  Under the CCMA, lending institutions are encouraging customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity regarding their concerns and any particular circumstances which may impact on the customer&rsquo;s financial well-being. </p>  <p>  A cross-industry co-ordination Group, chaired by Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), is looking at all coronavirus related issues that may impact customers.  This includes both the overall economic impact of the coronavirus situation and its direct effect on customers.  A number of emergency measures have also been announced by individual lending bodies including increased overdraft facilities and increased credit card and cash withdrawal limits.</p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, also continues to provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These supports for jobseekers with disabilities have been designed to enable persons with a disability to achieve their employment ambitions by focusing on the individual person&rsquo;s ability and capacity, rather than on the disability.  The pre-employment and in-employment supports available include:</p><p><b>Employment Supports for Jobseekers with a Disability:</b></p><p>DEASP Intreo Service</p><p>Jobseekers (including jobseekers with disabilities) who seek support from their local Intreo Centre, will have a meeting arranged with a case officer with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available with a view to them achieving their employment ambitions.</p><p>Local Employment Service</p><p>The Department contracts for the provision of the Local Employment Service, which provides a local gateway, or access point, to the full range of services and facilities that are available to help jobseekers, including jobseekers with disabilities, to enter or return to employment.</p><p>EmployAbility Service.</p><p>The Department has contracts for the provision of the EmployAbility Service with 24 companies.  This is a specialist employment service designed to improve employment outcomes for jobseekers with a disability.  The service includes the provision of dedicated job coach support as well as both pre-employment and in employment support and assistance.</p><p>AHEAD (Support For Graduates With Disabilities)</p><p>The Department contracts AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) to deliver the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) and &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; programmes.  These programmes provide supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter the workforce.</p><p>Ability</p><p>The &lsquo;Ability&rsquo; programme is co-funded by the Irish Exchequer and the EU's ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning Operational Programme (PEIL, 2014 &ndash; 20).  Under this programme funding has been provided, through Pobal, for 27 organisations to support young people (aged 15-29) with disabilities in their transition into further education or employment.</p><p><b>Employment Supports for Employers:</b></p><p>Wage Subsidy Scheme</p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme is targeted at private sector employers and is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of financial incentives (a wage subsidy). The subsidy is delivered in three strands:</p><p>-Strand I subsidy is a general subsidy for any productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison  to a colleague without a disability.  An employee must work for a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 subsidised hours per week. The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and the amount of the  subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.</p><p>- Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with a disability who are supported by a WSS Strand  I  payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work based costs  relating to these employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number ofemployees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability.</p><p>- Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 30 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.</p><p>Reasonable Accommodation Fund</p><p>The Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) assists both jobseekers with disabilities and employers to enable a persons with disabilities to enter/re-enter or sustain employment by providing a range of grants.  In summary, the fund is comprised of the following four grants:</p><p>Employee Retention Grant</p><p>The purpose of the Employee Retention Grant Scheme is to assist employers to retain employees who acquire a disability by providing funding to:</p><p>- Identify accommodation and / or training to enable the employee to remain in his/her current position; or</p><p>- Re-train the employee so that s/he can take up another position within the company.</p><p><i>Workplace Equipment/Adaptation Grant</i></p><p>Where a person with a disability has been offered employment or is in employment, and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment to do the job, s/he or the employer may apply for a grant towards the costs of adapting premises or equipment. </p><p><i>Job Interview Interpreter Grant</i></p><p>A jobseeker who is deaf, hard of hearing or has speech impairment and is attending job interviews, may apply for funding to have a sign language interpreter or other interpreter to attend the interview with him/her.  Funding can also be provided to cover the costs of an interpreter during an induction period when starting work.</p><p><i>Personal Reader Grant</i></p><p>If a person is blind or visually impaired and needs assistance with job-related reading, s/he may be entitled to a grant to allow him/her to employ a Personal Reader.</p><p>Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme</p><p>In addition to the RAF, the Disability Awareness Training Support Scheme (DASS) provides funding (a grant) for the provision of Disability Awareness Training for a company's staff.  The purpose of the training is to deliver clear and accurate information about disability and to address questions or concerns that employers and employees may have about working with and supporting a colleague with disabilities.</p><p>Finally, it is worth also noting that the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality (DJE) is the lead department with regards to Ireland&rsquo;s Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities.  DJE recently published a revised (phase two) action plan (in December 2019) in consultation with government departments/agencies and stakeholders to deliver on the objectives of the CES in the coming years. The revised action plan is available on the DJE website at</p></reply>

The conditions for receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment are that a person must of working age between 18 and up to 66 years old, have lost their employment on or after 6 March and the income associated with that employment due to the impact of the pandemic. If this is not the case the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is not payable. </p>  <p>  It would be impossible to construct a scheme based on claims of potential or prospective but unrealised seasonal employment, particularly in an environment where the economy was operating at full-employment with many unfilled vacancies prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. People who are currently receiving a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, including seasonal workers, who have been out of work for some time will continue to remain on this payment for the period they are entitled to it. </p>  <p>  Where a student engages in seasonal work but was not in employment on 6 March they would not be eligible to receive the COVID-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) Grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing third level education. The matter of supports for students for the forthcoming academic year should be referred to the Minister for Education and Skills.  </p>  <p>  Where a person is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for financial support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

In addition, a widow aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse/civil partner received the Household Benefits Package from this Department, may qualify for that package if they otherwise satisfy all other conditions and receive a relevant qualifying payment. </p>  <p>  - A Widow's Pension recipient may also qualify to receive Fuel Allowance, subject to the conditions of the scheme, including a means test.</p>  <p>  - A Widow's Pension recipient who qualifies for both the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance will automatically qualify for the Telephone Support Allowance.  This payment aims to help those living alone with the cost of  communications and/or home alert security systems.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Those over 66 years do not pay social insurance contributions and can, if in receipt of State Contributory Pension, retain all of their State pension as well as their employment income and retain that pension if they lose employment, thus guaranteeing an income support.  People in receipt of a reduced rate of non-contributory or means tested pension who are also in receipt of an employment income may have their pension payment increased if they lose that employment income or if it is reduced.  Recipients of State pension payments may, subject to satisfying eligibility conditions, have access to a range of supports not available to unemployed people aged under 66.  These include living alone increase, household benefits, telephone support allowance, free travel and free TV licence.  Additionally, as part of the Department&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 emergency, the Fuel Allowance season has been extended by four weeks.  </p>  <p>  A person under 18 years of age who has lost their employment and is living in the family home is treated as a dependent in relation to any social welfare payment payable to a parent. </p>  <p>  As previously outlined, the COVID 19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment was introduced for people who were in employment or self-employment on or after 6 March 2020 and have become fully unemployed due to the downturn in economic activity caused by the COVID 19 pandemic.  People who work in the gig economy or who are in precarious employment who do not satisfy these conditions are not entitled to the COVID 19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  People in these circumstances may be eligible for either the social insurance based Jobseekers Benefit or the means-tested Jobseekers Allowance.</p>  <p>  Where a person, of any age, is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for financial support through the means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These costs will be met by the Exchequer; the proposal is expected to cost &euro;260m.  The administration by local authorities of this measure will be by way of a credit in lieu of commercial rates.  My Department is currently preparing further guidance on the scope and application of the waiver for local authorities.  Individual applications by local authorities will not be required. No new primary or secondary legislation is needed to administer this measure.</p>  <p>  The position will be reviewed at a later date as part of a wider review of options to support enterprise and employment, and associated local authority funding implications, once the unwinding of public health restrictions has advanced.</p></reply>

Such exempted development is subject to a restriction under section 4(4) of the 2000 Act which states that exempted development status is lost if an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) under the EIA Directive or Appropriate Assessment under the Habitats Directive is required in respect of that development. </p>  <p>  Where there is a question as to what in any particular case is or is not development, or is or is not exempted development, it is open to any person on payment of the prescribed fee to request a written declaration under Section 5 of the 2000 Act from the relevant planning authority, or from An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) on referral. Any development that is not exempted development being carried out without planning permission or that does not comply with the terms of a planning permission is unauthorised development and may be subject to enforcement action by a planning authority.</p>  <p>  In terms of unauthorised development requiring EIA or Appropriate Assessment, regularisation may be sought by way of the &lsquo;substitute consent&rsquo; process set out at Part XA of the 2000 Act, which allows development that should have been the subject of environmental assessment, but was not, to be regularised where appropriate. In this context, I understand that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has in recent months received a number of applications for leave to apply for substitute consent in respect of peat extraction activities. It should be noted that except for certain quarry cases, where substitute consent is granted, such consent only regularises the past work that has been carried out and would not permit further development. A separate planning permission would be required for future development, in addition to the substitute consent. </p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the 2000 Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular planning case with which a planning authority or the Board, is or may be concerned.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is an independent statutory body assigned responsibility to determine planning appeals and certain other matters under the 2000 Act, including applications for substitute consent.</p>  <p>  In addition to the planning system, it should be noted that specified peat extraction may also require a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) system, which is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></reply>

In particular, from 14 April, the PRA began recording casework received up to 30 March on its system.  Moreover, from 20 April, the PRA resumed taking in applications for Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  In accordance with the national approach to tackling COVID-19, its public offices remained closed. However, it provided a copy instrument service for urgent property transaction closings.  </p>  <p>  The gradual upscaling of services which began on 14 April 2020 continues to be reviewed  by the PRA in line with COVID-19 recovery planning, public health guidance and the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  This will allow the PRA to continue to scale up its operations, carry out its statutory functions and ensure that a safe working environment is in place for its employees and members of the public in all its buildings in Dublin, Waterford and Roscommon. At the same time, in line with the national approach, remote working arrangements will continue in place to ensure that safe physical distancing can be maintained.</p>  <p>  Due to the current legal prohibition on the use of digital signatures for property transactions/registrations, the PRA&rsquo;s eRegistration service is limited to transactions that do not require a &ldquo;wet signature&rdquo; i.e. eDischarges (releases of mortgages) and eCharging Orders (Nursing Home scheme Charges). Accordingly, the majority of applications lodged in the PRA are paper-based legal deeds and documents. This creates challenges in rapidly enabling remote working for all case processing.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, preparatory work is underway, led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to provide the legal basis for the PRA to accept digitally signed documents for transactions involving registered land.</p>  <p>  The number of transactions on hand in the PRA increased from 102,805 at end February to 113,866 at the end of April because of the COVID-19 restrictions.  The upscaling of operations and a steady decrease in the intake of applications now being experienced will see the level of cases on hand decreasing again.  Applications are being dealt with in order of priority.  However, urgent applications are being processed expeditiously, as requested, on a case by case basis.  As applications for registration are often complex, necessitating numerous legal queries, it is not possible to give representative timelines for dealing with cases.  </p>  <p>  Copy Folios/Maps and Copy Instruments are being issued. Customers can apply for copies in the normal way through the landdirect portal.  Landdirect, eRegistration services and registration of deeds services continue to operate as normal.</p>  <p>  In relation to any specific cases, arrangements have been put in place by all State bodies under the aegis of my Department to facilitate the provision of information directly to members of the Oireachtas.  Further information in relation to the specific case referred to may be obtained by contacting the specific e-mail address in respect of the PRA, reps@prai.ie.</p></reply>

This is, in effect, what is often colloquially referred to as a grandfather clause.</p><p>In 2013, in response in particular to the lower than anticipated rate of applications for registration by technical assessment, an independent review of the arrangements in place for registration was undertaken by Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor. Mr Fennell&rsquo;s report on the matter is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>http://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/BuildingStandards/FileDownLoad%2C34097%2Cen.pdf. </p><p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht also examined the matter and published its Report on the Title of Architect (July 2013) which is available at: </p><p>Both reports, which were welcomed by my Department, made a number of recommendations intended to improve and streamline the arrangements for registration. Implementation of these recommendations, in consultation with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others, has seen a number of reforms being implemented, which include the administration of the technical assessment process on a cyclical basis where briefing, guidance and support for candidates can be administered in a structured manner; mentoring and supporting applicants; facilitating assessment based on recent projects; facilitating applicants with reassessment/reapplication (i.e. ensuring that the technical assessment procedure is not seen as a one chance only route to registration); and reviewing and simplifying guidance materials with direct input from practice-trained persons. My Department and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others in this manner to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements of registration arrangements can be made in the context of the Fennell report or otherwise.</p><p>In addition to the transitional &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provision set out above, section 14(2)(f) of the Act provides a permanent route to registration for practically trained persons who have 7 years appropriate practical experience and who have passed the prescribed register examination. In 2016, the Architects Alliance of Ireland proposed a special entry route to incorporate the proposed development of a prescribed register admission examination as currently provided for under this section. While the Act would allow me to prescribe such a register admission examination as a route to registration for eligible persons, neither I nor my Department have the remit or the competence to validate or approve the proposed register admission examination. Assessment for registration under section 14(2)(f) comes within the responsibility of the RIAI, who are designated as the registration body for the purposes of the 2007 Act, and as the competent authority for the purposes of the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications (as amended). For this reason, the Architects Alliance of Ireland were advised by my Department to discuss their proposal, in the first instance, with the RIAI as registration body and competent authority for the architectural profession in Ireland.</p><p>My Department and the RIAI, as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and all other stakeholders to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements in registration arrangements can be made. I would encourage all practically trained persons to pursue the routes to registration which are open to them and to continue to engage constructively with my Department and the RIAI.</p></reply>

Also under the 2011 Regulations, a household may apply for support to one housing authority only (the &ldquo;housing authority of application&rdquo;), which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or where the authority agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p>  <p>  A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on my Department's website at the following link: https://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/other/social-housing-support-table-income-limits </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing. </p>  <p>  Households in cities like Galway, Cork or Dublin may apply for areas of choice in the city and/or county area. Where a county area is specified, this is dependent on that household not exceeding the maximum net income threshold for the county area, which in the case of Galway County is &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;30,000 for a household of three adults and four children.  </p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001.  </p><p>Previously, for an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must have satisfied the criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016), as follows:  </p><p>(i) the annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and  </p><p>(ii) the average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (i.e the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,226 per month in Q4  2019).  </p><p>However, on 30 May 2019, I signed the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (Commencement) Order 2019 which appointed 31 May 2019 and 4 June 2019 as the dates on which specified provisions of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 came into effect, including provisions in respect of the average rent qualifying criterion for RPZ designation.Specifically, in relation to criteria (ii) above, the rent of a dwelling in the Greater Dublin Area (Kildare, Wicklow and Meath) will now be compared to the average rent across the country, excluding Dublin rents; and the rent of a dwelling outside of the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) will be compared to the average rent across the country, excluding Greater Dublin Area rents.</p><p>Each quarterly RTB Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. The quarterly Rent Index Reports are available to view on the RTB's website at the following link: .</p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at , by searching 'rent pressure zones - information'.  </p><p>The Local Electoral Area (LEA) of Portlaoise, Co Laois was designated as a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) on 2 July 2019.</p><p>While rental inflation in the Edenderry LEA has been above 7% in 5 of the last 6 quarters, the standardised average rent in Edenderry in Q4 2019 was &euro;781.21, which is below the Non-GDA Standardised Average Rent of &euro;872.09 per month, thereby not satisfying the criteria for designation as an RPZ at this time.</p><p>The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if the Edenderry LEA meets the designation criteria it will be designated as a RPZ.</p></reply>

It should be noted that rents can go down where a person&rsquo;s income reduces. Accordingly, a rent freeze would not be appropriate as it would prevent downward rent movements in such circumstances and, therefore, no rent freeze has been implemented by local authorities.  </p>  <p>  Where a person resident in social housing has lost employment as a result of COVID-19, their local authority can review the rent payable to take account of this.  In the current situation, local authority staff engaged on rents administration are prioritising the processing of these applications for downward rent reviews.  </p>  <p>  In relation to any household income increase that may be attributable to COVID-19 payments issued by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I understand that local authorities are not currently increasing rents on foot of these payments on the basis that they are temporary in nature.</p></reply>

In this context, the date of 20 April 2020 was specified in the Order as the date on which the period to be disregarded under section 251A(1) of the Planning Act was to end, comprising a period of 23 days. </p><p>Arising from the decision of the Government to extend the COVID-19 related measures restricting the movement of the public until 5 May 2020, the Government on 16 April 2020 made an Order under Section 251A(4) of the Planning Act further extending the duration of all relevant periods and timelines specified in planning legislation by an additional 19 days, up to and including 9 May 2020. As the Government has since decided to extend further the COVID-19 related restrictive measures until 18 May 2020, the Government has now made an additional Order under section 251A(4) of the Planning Act extending the duration of all relevant periods and timelines specified in planning legislation by an additional 14 days, up to and including 23 May 2020. </p><p>The three Orders have the combined effect of extending the relevant planning periods and timelines by an aggregate of 56 days/8 weeks.  Notifications of these Orders, including reference to an updated FAQ document, have been issued in circular letters to all planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

Tenants cannot be forced to leave their rental accommodation during this period, other than in exceptional circumstances.  Initially, these emergency legislative provisions will last for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary. </p><p>My Department has published a Guidance Document on COVID-19 supports for landlords and tenants which sets out the emergency rental measures and income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during the emergency period. The Guidance document is available at:</p><p>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/COVID_Update_Guidance_Document_final.pdf </p><p>and a list of Frequently Asked Questions has been developed and is available at:</p><p>.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 provide for minimum notice periods to be served by tenants and landlords for tenancy terminations &ndash; for example, a student must provide 28 days notice to end a tenancy of less than 6 months duration or 35 days to end a tenancy of more than 6 months but less than 1 year. </p><p>The Acts do not prescribe specific terms and conditions regarding the payment of rents or deposits for inclusion in individual letting agreements in the private rental market including the student-specific accommodation sector. Contract law governs such arrangements.</p><p>The specific terms associated with an individual student&rsquo;s rights and obligations are likely to be set out in a written contract signed by both the student and the landlord. Engagement between the parties to clarify the respective contractual obligations of the student and the landlord is key in establishing whether a breach of contract had occurred.</p><p>I understand that where State universities have closed due to COVID-19, they are generally providing refunds in respect of their directly owned student-specific accommodation.</p><p>Students may wish to contact their third level education providers to seek any assistance that they might be in a position to provide. If a student cannot come to an agreement with their accommodation provider, they might wish to contact the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) regarding their concerns &ndash; https://www.rtb.ie/&ndash; or to refer a dispute for resolution with regard to the non-refund of their deposit. </p><p>The RTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to comment on or intervene in the specifics of any individual case.</p></reply>

This work includes the development of two pathfinder projects on local authority-owned sites, at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, and at Emmet Road in Dublin City, from which lessons will be drawn to inform an optimum model for Cost Rental delivery at the national level.</p>  <p>  The latter project, at Emmet Road in Inchicore, incorporates the site of the former St Michael's Estate referred to by the Deputy. Dublin City Council (DCC), the site owner, has advised it is continuing to make progress on the design and planning work for this project. It has appointed a dedicated project manager and project team, and has completed a development framework plan for the project. Most recently, DCC has just completed the procurement process to secure an architect-led integrated design team, who will now be responsible for detailed design of the scheme, obtaining all statutory consents and the delivery on site of a new sustainable neighbourhood. </p>  <p>  Overall, it is projected that this site can accommodate 484 homes in a high-quality mixed tenure development, including 375 Cost Rental apartments. DCC intends that the remaining homes will be provided for social housing and is engaging with my Department in terms of funding for that part of the project. DCC is also engaging with the European Investment Bank, which has signaled funding support in principle in respect of the Cost Rental housing element of the project.</p></reply>

AHBs utilise private finance as well as Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) and Payment and Availability (P&amp;amp;A) funding available from my Department to fund these units.</p><p>Property acquisition and subsequent sale to AHBs is a process that can take some time, therefore, in order to maximise the potential for use of properties acquired by the Agency in the intervening period, an innovative Caretaker Lease arrangement has been developed. This allows the Agency to assign a property to an AHB who can carry out any necessary repairs and liaise with the Local Authority to tenant the unit, in parallel with the onward acquisition of the unit.</p><p>Up to end Q4 2019, a total of 747 properties had been purchased by the Agency using the Fund and placed on caretaker leases with AHBs or sold to local authorities.

This includes day to day maintenance, cyclical maintenance and all the associated operational risks, in addition to the initial construction risks carried by the lessor.  In exchange, the lessor receives up to 95% of the open market rent. </p>  <p>  The first call for proposals for the Enhanced Leasing Scheme was open from January to April 2018 and a total of 33 submissions were received.  The second call for proposals closed on 25th October 2018 and a total of 22 submissions were received. </p>  <p>  The first Agreement for Lease was signed in Q2 2019 for 23 new social housing homes, with expected delivery in 2020.  The first homes delivered under the Enhanced Leasing Scheme were delivered in Q4 2019, bringing the total to 113 homes.  No payments were made by my Department for these units in 2019 but the estimated average annual lease cost for 2020 for these 113 units is &euro;22,221.  Delivery to date has been concentrated in the Dublin area; as the scheme matures, it is expected that more units will be delivered in other locations and, accordingly, the average cost will be reduced.</p></reply>

The SDZ planning scheme requires the delivery of 15% homes for social and affordable housing purposes, which is in addition to the statutory 10% under Part V arrangements. </p>  <p>  In relation to the wider activation of these lands, it is understood that NAMA is currently undertaking a process to select a preferred bidder to develop the lands in the SDZ scheme area.  My Department remains committed to working with Dublin City Council, any relevant Approved Housing Bodies and either the receiver and/or developers of the SDZ area in order to secure additional social and affordable housing from this site over and above Part V obligations and of the order of magnitude laid out in the adopted planning scheme.  This will be subject to agreement on all the normal and relevant terms, including value for money aspects.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Clonburris SDZ, which has the capacity to provide up to 11,000 homes, approved funding under LIHAF is being made available for infrastructure to support the delivery of over 1,000 homes in the first phase of activity. While South Dublin County Council has confirmed that a development agreement has not yet been completed regarding this housing provision, by leveraging the value of the LIHAF infrastructure, a significant number of the homes delivered will be available at prices below market value.</p>  <p>  In addition, funding under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) has been approved to support the Council's plans to deliver a further 90 social  and 133 homes for purchase under the affordable purchase scheme (although it is anticipated that the number of affordable homes may increase as the project develops).  These homes will be sold at rates which are  below open market values and for which South Dublin County Council has estimated a price range of &euro;253,000 to &euro;263,000. At these prices, using the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, a couple with a joint income in the region of &euro;45,000 would be in a position to buy such a home.   </p>  <p>  The Council has indicated that a development partnership between the site owners and the Council will see a detailed design for the full site finalised later this year. </p></reply>

Upon completion, service provision under the contract will include building and asset management, waste management, security, void management, tenant helpdesk services and the provision of community development services.  At the end of the service period, the homes will be handed over to the relevant local authority.</p><p>Bundle 2 of the programme will provide 465 homes across eight sites, as set out in the following Table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Site (Local Authority)</th>       <th>Number of Homes</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>The Walk,   Roscommon Town (Roscommon)</td>       <td>53 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>The Miles, Clonakilty (Cork County)</td>       <td>52 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Slievekeale (Waterford City and County)</td>       <td>58 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballyburke (Galway City)</td>       <td>74 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shannon East (Clare)</td>       <td>51 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Poundhill, Skibbereen (Cork County)</td>       <td>50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Oakwood, Macroom (Cork County)</td>       <td>50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Butterstream, Clane (Kildare)</td>       <td>77 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>465 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The contract with the winning bidder for this Bundle, Torc Housing Partnership, reached Financial Close on 27 November 2019. This consortium is comprised of a joint venture of JJ Rhatigan &amp;amp; Co. and the Spanish firm Obrascon Huarte Lain S.A. as construction contractors. Upon completion of construction, facilities management will be provided by Derwent FM and Tuath Housing Association during the 25-year service period, with Tuath also providing tenancy management. These bodies are also providing equity for the project in conjunction with the primary equity providers Equitix Ltd. and Kajima Partnerships Ltd. The German bank Nord/LB is providing debt funding for the project.</p><p>The full value of the Bundle 2 contract, the duration of which includes the construction period plus a 25-year operating period, is estimated in nominal terms at &euro;253 million (exclusive of VAT but including a forecast of inflation). This cost was publically released following financial close of the project, and as per Bundle 1, this includes all construction costs plus maintenance, operating, lifecycle, tenancy management and financing costs.</p><p>Construction had commenced on the Bundle 2 sites prior to the onset of COVID-19 and, similar to Bundle 1, the full impact of the Covid-19 measures on the programme remains to be determined. The service provisions attached to the contract are also consistent with Bundle 1 and at the end of the service period the homes involved will be handed back to the relevant local authority.</p><p>Preparation work has recently commenced on the third Bundle of sites in the programme. A number of sites were proposed by local authorities on foot of a request seeking nominations of sites for consideration as part of the third bundle. Following examination and evaluation of the sites proposed, initial approval in principle was communicated to the successful local authorities in October 2019, subject to final due diligence that has recently been completed. Three sites were selected in the Dublin City Council local authority area, and one each in Kildare, Sligo, and Wicklow.</p><p>The following table sets out the indicative number of homes that will be provided at each of these locations pending the design and planning phases, with the total number of homes across the whole bundle expected to be in the region of 440. <table>    <tr>       <th>Site (Local   Authority)</th>       <th>Indicative Number of Homes (pending design and planning)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ready Mix   Site, East Wall, Dublin 3 (Dublin City)</td>       <td>65 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shangan Road, Ballymum, Dublin 9 (Dublin City)</td>       <td>100 Senior   Citizen Units</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Collins Avenue, Dublin 9 (Dublin City)</td>       <td>90 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ardew, Athy (Kildare)</td>       <td>60 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rathellen, Finisklin (Sligo)</td>       <td>50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Blessington (Wicklow)</td>       <td>76 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>c.441 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), in its role as procuring authority and financial advisor, and Dublin City Council as lead local authority and Sponsoring Agency, have commenced the initial planning for the tender process and engagement with the relevant local authorities.  It is planned that tenders will be invited in 2021 and therefore it is not possible to give details on costs at this stage.</p><p>The Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) is an essential part of any PPP project. It contains commercially sensitive information in relation to the methodology used for costing public sector projects and for the pricing of risks by public sector bodies. In accordance with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines (Guidelines for the use of Public Private Partnerships), the final PSB, or any elements thereof, is not made public during the tendering process nor where it is intended to procure further similar projects in the near future (e.g. subsequent project bundles as part of an ongoing PPP programme). As Bundle 3 will follow the same structure as Bundles 1 and 2 and given the potential impact on value for money for the State, it is not appropriate to release the PSB for Bundle 1 at this time. </p><p>However, and in accordance with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines, once an appropriate period of time has elapsed and the commercial sensitivity of the information on the project is no longer an issue (having regard also to any other similar PPP projects which may be in pre-procurement), the PSB should be made public.

Of the 30 projects, Kildare County Council has confirmed that its project on the Naas Inner Relief Road will not now progress, although an element of the housing delivery that was associated with the project has taken place. </p><p>Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description and projected housing delivery are available at www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF.</p><p>Currently, 3 LIHAF projects have completed infrastructure construction. Of the remaining 26, up to the end of April (and excluding the Naas project), 14 projects have been approved to go to, or are already at, infrastructure construction stage. Of the remaining 12 projects, 3 are expected to have tenders approved and go to construction before the end of Q3 2020. Nine are not yet ready to go to infrastructure tender stage; my Department is reviewing these projects and considering requests from local authorities for extensions to the funding agreements as and when they arise. </p><p>In terms of LIHAF funding drawdown, thus far, most infrastructure projects have been at the design, planning and procurement stages, and the bulk of expenditure will arise during the construction phase. This is reflected in the level of expenditure to end Q1 2020, with approximately &euro;37.731 million in Exchequer funds drawn down (matched by a further 25% local authority funding bringing the total expenditure to &euro;50.308m). Drawdown of LIHAF Exchequer grant funding from my Department commenced with &euro;1.604m in 2017, a further &euro;6.815m in 2018, &euro;22.244m in 2019 and approximately &euro;7.068m to end Q1 2020.  </p><p>The following table details the Exchequer funding (75%) drawn down for each project in 2019. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local  Authority </th>       <th>Project Name </th>       <th>Drawdown of LIHAF funding Exchequer Contribution (75%) for 2019 (&euro;) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>Claureen, Ennis </td>       <td>69,410</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City </td>       <td>Old Whitechurch Road </td>       <td>3,306,887</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City </td>       <td>South Docks </td>       <td>130,222</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City</td>       <td>Glanmire</td>       <td>361,700</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County </td>       <td>Midleton (Water-rock) </td>       <td>101,171</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County </td>       <td>Carrigaline</td>       <td>396,848</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City </td>       <td>Dodder Bridge </td>       <td>221,277</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City </td>       <td>Belmayne and Clongriffin </td>       <td>314,602</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown </td>       <td>Cherrywood</td>       <td>1,984,303</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown </td>       <td>Woodbrook Shanganagh </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown </td>       <td>Clay Farm </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal </td>       <td>Donabate Distributor Road </td>       <td>6,848,556</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal </td>       <td>Oldtown Mooretown </td>       <td>1,752,466</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal </td>       <td>Baldoyle Stapolin </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Naas </td>       <td>232,626</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Maynooth</td>       <td>209,533</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Sallins</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Ferrybank</td>       <td>32,024</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Western Environs </td>       <td>3,036,632</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>Mungret</td>       <td>917,829</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>Newtown Drogheda </td>       <td>56,333</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>Mount Avenue Dundalk </td>       <td>68,817</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>Ratoath</td>       <td>557,540</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>Farganstown, Navan </td>       <td>327,039</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin </td>       <td>Kilcarbery/Corkagh Grange </td>       <td>549,859</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin </td>       <td>Clonburris SDZ </td>       <td>12,461</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin </td>       <td>Adamstown</td>       <td>606,355</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County Council </td>       <td>Gracedieu</td>       <td>60,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County Council </td>       <td>Kilbarry</td>       <td>60,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>Brawny Road, Athlone </td>       <td>30,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The reform agenda includes:</p>  <p>  - amendments made to the Building Control Regulations;   </p>  <p>  - the National Building Control Management Project; and</p>  <p>  - the ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Building Control Acts, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure that immediate risks are addressed and that a plan is put in place, where required, for works to bring buildings into compliance. </p>  <p>  My focus will remain firmly on ensuring the full roll out of the building control reform agenda, to ensure that all those that engaged in the construction sector take their responsibilities seriously and are appropriately held to account.  As part of the reform agenda, consumer protection will continue to be my core concern and any proposals in that regard will, of course, be considered.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the full terms and conditions of the scheme, including the making of the regulations referred to above, were finalised in consultation with the Attorney General's Office and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This process took account of the comprehensive engagement that took place between my Department and both Donegal and Mayo County Councils, who will operate and administer the scheme.</p>  <p>  The defective concrete blocks grant scheme is primarily a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  The scheme outlines five remedial options ranging from rebuilding on existing foundations to replacing of external walls. The maximum approved  costs per dwelling under the scheme range from &euro;55,000 to &euro;275,000, depending on the remedial option. A grant of 90% of the approved costs associated with the necessary remediation works, subject to a maximum for each remedial option, or 90% of the actual cost of the remedial works, whichever is the lesser, is available under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at assisting a restricted group of homeowners who have no other practicable options to access redress. It is not a compensation scheme and the regulations apply only in respect of qualifying works that have not commenced prior to confirmation of grant approval being issued in respect of a dwelling by the relevant local authority. Homeowners cannot seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken either prior to the commencement, or outside, of the scheme. This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement.</p>  <p>   Budget 2020 provides funding of &euro;40 million to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme this year.  Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process.  Mindful that the scheme is being funded from the Exchequer, the scope of the scheme cannot be open ended. The funding available must be used prudently to achieve the most efficient and cost effective outcomes.</p></reply>

This will include the inspection of planning application files in the offices of the planning authority in accordance with Article 18(1)(e) of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations). </p>  <p>  Provision is already made under Article 27(5) of the Regulations for the making available of the weekly lists of planning applications for inspection for a period of not less than 8 weeks, beginning on the day on which it is made available, in or at the offices of the planning authority, and in each public library and mobile library in its functional area and at any other place or by any other means, including electronic form, that the authority considers appropriate. </p>  <p>  In the context of the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, published on 1 May last, my Department is working with planning authorities on various options to support public participation in these circumstances and facilitate the advancement of certain decision making processes on expiry of the period under the Orders made under Section 251A.  This may include, in the context of the phased return to full opening of planning offices, the putting in place of arrangements, by appointment, for the viewing of planning application files either in hard copy or electronically at the public counters of the planning offices or the local public libraries, subject of course to adhering to physical distancing and other public health and health and safety protocols in place to protect both local authority staff and members of the public.  This would be in addition to the making available of the weekly lists of planning applications at local libraries as referred to above.</p>  <p>  The final detailed arrangements in relation to facilitating public participation in the planning system, including the viewing of planning files by members of the public, will be publicised in advance of the expiry of the period under the Orders made under Section 251A.</p></reply>

The re-opening of businesses in the context of the pandemic should be in accordance with the terms of the Government's Roadmap for Re-Opening Society and Business, as published on 1 May 2020, and with relevant public health and health and safety advice and protocols.</p>  <p>  With regard to planning, an individual can apply to his/her local planning authority for a determination under section 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, as to whether any particular case is or is not development, or is or is not exempted development, within the meaning of the Act. This would inform the small business owner whether or not planning permission is required for him or her to operate from his or her home.</p>  <p>  The granting of planning permission or a declaration that development is exempted development does not solely authorise development, including &lsquo;change of use&rsquo; of premises, to proceed where other consents are required. The operation of a business may be subject to multiple requirements of which planning is just one. I have no plans to introduce new exempted development planning regulations allowing for the &lsquo;change of use&rsquo; of a home to a business premises at this time.</p></reply>

Initially, these emergency laws will last for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it is necessary.</p><p>Under the legislation, the process for any extension of the 3 month period involves the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government requesting the Government to make an Order, having consulted with the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government must consider it appropriate and be satisfied that it is in the public interest to extend the emergency period having regard to:</p><p>- the threat to public health;</p><p>- the highly contagious nature of COVID-19; and </p><p>- the need to restrict the movement of persons to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>The consideration of whether to request the Government to make an Order to extend the emergency period will be made at the appropriate time and in accordance with the relevant legislation. </p></reply>

Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority, advertising and application procedures were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  </p>  <p>  In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place including the form of charging orders, the length of the charged period and the minimum repayment that can be made during the charged period.   When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.</p></reply>

The pre legislative scrutiny process is now complete and the Committee's report was received by my Department in December 2019. This report will be considered in finalising the Bill, which it is intended will be brought to the Oireachtas in the coming months.</p><p>The day to day management of the LDA is matter for the LDA Chief Executive and his management team reporting to the LDA Interim Board. Under its Establishment Order, the LDA may appoint such and so many persons to be employees as it may determine.  The LDA will report on its salary and consultancy costs in its annual financial statements in accordance with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  In addition, as with all State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, arrangements have been put in place by the LDA through which Oireachtas members can request information directly from the Agency in relation to operational matters - in this regard, the LDA may be contacted directly at oireachtas@lda.ie. </p><p>In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, on the basis of information provided by the LDA to my Department, I can indicate that the LDA currently has 17 staff, including 3 seconded from other State bodies.  It is currently actively recruiting further staff and expects to have 45 employees by the end of the year, rising to 50 in 2021.  It will have skilled staff in the areas of finance, investment appraisal, investment management, legal, procurement and property development (i.e. quantity surveyors, engineers, planners, architects etc) along with corporate and compliance support roles.  The LDA does not operate a grading system. Contracts are agreed with employees following a competitive hiring process. The LDA is forecasting its annual salary costs to be approximately &euro;3 million by 2021 for a staff complement of 50.</p><p>As with any other body responsible for developing large scale projects, the LDA requires professional and technical advisors and these services are tendered for in line with public procurement processes. Public tenders vary in length and do not guarantee any award of services or expenditure until contracts are negotiated. Examples of professional services tendered to date by the LDA include Legal, Architect Lead Design, Project Management, HR, Procurement, Corporate Advisory, Communications.</p><p>To date professional fees incurred by the LDA on projects are predominantly planning and design fees and project management fees, according as the LDA conducts feasibility and design work on their portfolio of sites. The total costs incurred across sites is in the region of &euro;1 million to date.  Corporate professional fees, including procurement fees, communications, recruitment, IT and legal, of approximately &euro;500,000 have also been incurred to date during the LDA's set up phase.</p><p>The LDA currently leases office space in Ashford House, Tara Street, Dublin 2. The annual rent is &euro;248,000 (ex VAT) with an annual service  charge of &euro;40,000 (ex VAT).  Limerick City and County Council made accommodation available to one agency employee based in Limerick for a period, for which no rent was paid by the LDA.</p><p>The LDA currently has access to an initial tranche of 9 sites across the country that have near term delivery potential for 3,600 new homes. Further details of the sites are set out in the following table. </p><p>It is also working in partnership with other local authorities around the country. It is running a design review of the Sandy Road Regeneration Project in Galway which has the potential for up to 1,000 homes. It is also working with Limerick City and County Council on a site near Colbert Station in Limerick, funding a masterplan of the site which consists of lands owned by the Council, CIE, the Department of Education and the HSE. </p><p>It is not possible to determine total delivery costs of the projects at this stage as the design work has not yet been completed. The LDA will establish appropriate funding mechanisms for each of its projects including proposed investment from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and other sources.</p><p>Update on LDA sites <table>    <tr>       <th>Location</th>       <th>Size</th>       <th>Projected number of units</th>       <th>Status</th>       <th>Partners</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shanganagh, Dublin  </td>       <td>17.8 acres</td>       <td>597 units, of which 200 social, 91 cost purchase, 306 cost rental</td>       <td>Part 10 application submitted to An Bord Pleanala in January 2020 with construction to follow subject to planning permission.</td>       <td>Site being developed in conjunction with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council.</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Central Mental Hospital,   Dundrum</td>       <td>28 acres</td>       <td>1,200 units (estimated)</td>       <td>Pre-planning<br /><br />Design team appointed.<br /><br />LDA expects to   lodge a planning application in mid-2021 and begin construction in early 2022</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Devoy Barracks, Naas</td>       <td>13.9 acres</td>       <td>210 units (estimated)</td>       <td>Pre-planning.  Draft masterplan prepared</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St Kevin&rsquo;s   Hospital, Cork</td>       <td>14.5 acres</td>       <td>274 units (estimated)</td>       <td>Pre-planning.

In these projects, NAMA funds the remediation of the common areas and the completion of the unfinished units, which are often the last remaining incomplete and vacant units in estates. When the units are complete, NARPS purchases the finished properties and leases them immediately to an AHB or local authority. Information in relation to the number of leases, broken down by AHB and local authority, is available on the NAMA website (updated to end-March 2020), at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>All NARPS leases are 20 years and 9 months in duration. The total cost of NARPS leases in 2019 was &euro;11,116,511 and the total cost in 2018 was &euro;12,126,909. Leasing costs prior to 2018 are available on a cumulative basis only and, as such, it is not possible to give a breakdown of the cost of NARPS leases before that date. </p><p>The ownership of the properties remains with NARPS at the expiration of the lease term. Following a direction by the Minister for Finance in 2019, NARPS will be retained in long term State ownership. NAMA will transfer NARPS to the State at the direction of the Minister for Finance and this comprises &euro;300 million of the projected &euro;4 billion surplus. This reflects the current value of the portfolio, based on lease income. </p><p>The tenancy and property management of the dwellings is a matter for the relevant local authority or Approved Housing Body.</p></reply>

Enforcement of RTB dispute determination orders has a firm legal base in those Acts. When landlords, tenants and third parties access the RTB dispute resolution service through mediation, adjudication or an appeal through a tenancy tribunal, they receive a legally binding determination order. Where non-compliance occurs, the RTB initially seeks to secure compliance by non-judicial means. Where non-compliance persists, the RTB will consider requests from  injured parties to provide legal assistance to enforce the Order.  The RTB has set out the policy and criteria it follows in this regard, which is available on its website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Alternatively, an injured party may wish to take their own enforcement proceedings directly to the courts. A Guide to Enforcement in the District Court is also available on the RTB's website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Enforcement proceedings may involve the registration of the judgment of the Court and these judgments may then be published in the various Trade Gazettes, etc. The RTB website also displays the details of persons against whom it obtains court orders for any non-compliance with its determination orders. </p><p>If a party fails to comply with a Court order, the RTB may in certain circumstances seek further orders from the Court such as execution orders to engage the local sheriff to seize goods, orders for attachment on earnings and, in extreme circumstances, orders from the Court for attachment and committal.</p><p>The RTB has no power to prevent any non-compliant party from continuing to rent properties.  However, RTB Adjudicators and Tribunal members can award damages against a party for breaches of their obligations under the Residential Tenancies Acts. These damages, which are awarded to the other party, can be up to &euro;20,000 depending on the severity of the offence.</p><p>A person guilty of an offence under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 is liable, in accordance with section 9 of the 2004 Act, on summary conviction to a Class B fine (currently up to a maximum of &euro;4,000 under the Fines Act 2010 ) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. If the contravention in respect of which a person is convicted of an offence under those Acts continues after the conviction, the person is guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention continues and for each such offence the person shall be liable on summary conviction to a Class E fine (currently up to a maximum of &euro;500 under the Fines Act 2010).</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 empowers the RTB to investigate improper conduct by landlords and impose sanctions under a new Part 7A &ndash; Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions &ndash; inserted into the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. In particular, unlawful rent increases in RPZs, unlawful tenancy terminations and non-registration of tenancies  can be investigated by the RTB with the imposition of a possible sanction of up to &euro;30,000.</p><p>Section 148AD of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 sets out the matters to be considered by the RTB in deciding on any sanction to be imposed. These matters include:</p><p>- the need for any sanction to be appropriate and proportionate; sufficient to deter the recurrence of any similar improper conduct; and in the public interest to encourage compliance with the Act;</p><p>- the seriousness, duration and any re-occurrence of the improper conduct;</p><p>- any continuation of the improper conduct after the landlord was notified of the investigation concerned; and</p><p>- whether a sanction has previously been imposed on foot of a similar occurrence of improper conduct. </p><p>I do not consider it necessary to further strengthen the RTB's sanctioning powers at this stage but I will continue to keep the matter under review. </p></reply>

Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the statutory credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency of treatment for all applicants. </p>  <p>  Loan applicants who are dissatisfied with a loan application decision of a local authority Credit Committee may appeal that decision to the local authority. Details of the appeals process can be obtained from the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that current applicants for a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan may be experiencing difficulties arising out of COVID-19. Local authorities are being asked to show flexibility when dealing with applicants at all stages of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan process from application and approval, to drawdown and appeal and should extend the time periods as necessary to accommodate those who may be experiencing difficulties arising out of COVID-19 restrictions.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, local authorities are also required to be prudent with their lending, both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, and ensure that mortgages are only advanced based on up to date financial and employment data from applicants, as appropriate, having regard to the implications that COVID-19 has had for many businesses and employers.  In such cases, a decision on whether to withdraw or vary a loan offer is a decision for each local authority.</p>  <p>  Loan offer and conditionality are ultimately a contractual matter between the borrower and the local authority.  As such, borrowers may wish to consult with their solicitor who can advise further on contractual matters.</p></reply>

It is not possible to disaggregate expenditure into that expended specifically on public land.</p><p>In relation to affordability issues, the objective of the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) is to provide for key enabling infrastructure requirements that will help unlock publicly-owned lands specifically for affordable homes to buy or rent.  &euro;310 million is to be made available under the SSF, comprising an Exchequer contribution of &euro;275 million, plus &euro;35 million contribution from local authorities.  A maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 is available per affordable home. On this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes can be facilitated.  To date, &euro;127 million has been allocated in SSF funding for infrastructure that will facilitate the development of approximately 3,200 homes that will be made available across 35 developments in 14 local authorities.</p><p>Details of all SSF funded infrastructure projects are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>Additionally, as an initiative under Rebuilding Ireland, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is primarily designed to fund the provision of public off-site infrastructure to relieve critical infrastructure blockages and enable housing developments to be built on key sites at scale.  This will activate the delivery of almost 20,000 new homes across public and private sites, within which 3,274 are to be Part V/social housing homes, 2,100 affordable homes and 5,686 cost reduced homes are due to be provided.</p><p>30 projects received final LIHAF approval with an overall budget of &euro;195.7 million, of which &euro;146.8 million will be Exchequer funded, with the remainder funded via local authorities.  Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description and projected housing delivery are available at www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF.</p><p>In terms of LIHAF funding drawdown, thus far, most infrastructure projects have been at the design, planning and procurement stages, and the bulk of expenditure will arise during the construction phase. This is reflected in the level of expenditure to end Q1 2020, with approximately &euro;37.731 million in Exchequer funds drawn down (matched by a further 25% local authority funding, bringing the total expenditure to &euro;50.308 million). Drawdown of LIHAF grant funding from my Department commenced with &euro;1.604m in Exchequer funding provided in 2017, a further &euro;6.815 million in 2018, &euro;22.244 million in 2019 and approximately &euro;7.068 million to end Q1 2020.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local   Authority</td>       <td>Build Expenditure</td>       <td>Build Expenditure</td>       <td>Build Expenditure</td>       <td>Build Expenditure</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>       <td>&euro;m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>2.87</td>       <td>5.25</td>       <td>6.03</td>       <td>14.71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>1.19</td>       <td>1.16</td>       <td>3.02</td>       <td>4.22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>1.55</td>       <td>3.20</td>       <td>3.67</td>       <td>11.98</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City</td>       <td>26.78</td>       <td>13.92</td>       <td>42.31</td>       <td>55.43</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County</td>       <td>6.66</td>       <td>16.67</td>       <td>53.99</td>       <td>65.54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>1.36</td>       <td>4.28</td>       <td>10.36</td>       <td>9.86</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown</td>       <td>5.56</td>       <td>26.90</td>       <td>25.89</td>       <td>10.20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>58.32</td>       <td>85.37</td>       <td>152.97</td>       <td>100.80</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>6.51</td>       <td>31.47</td>       <td>61.06</td>       <td>58.59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City</td>       <td>0.38</td>       <td>4.65</td>       <td>11.23</td>       <td>21.96</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County</td>       <td>1.27</td>       <td>1.88</td>       <td>12.33</td>       <td>15.95</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>2.71</td>       <td>6.90</td>       <td>19.96</td>       <td>22.32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>1.63</td>       <td>11.33</td>       <td>27.83</td>       <td>59.18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>2.13</td>       <td>5.60</td>       <td>18.72</td>       <td>12.66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>0.86</td>       <td>3.28</td>       <td>1.87</td>       <td>6.06</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>0.75</td>       <td>0.14</td>       <td>1.46</td>       <td>3.21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>22.91</td>       <td>46.00</td>       <td>50.21</td>       <td>40.20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>0.51</td>       <td>2.97</td>       <td>9.40</td>       <td>15.56</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>1.90</td>       <td>4.67</td>       <td>12.57</td>       <td>28.01</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>1.97</td>       <td>2.60</td>       <td>6.62</td>       <td>19.38</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>6.41</td>       <td>10.34</td>       <td>38.58</td>       <td>42.68</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>0.83</td>       <td>8.72</td>       <td>8.64</td>       <td>12.32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>0.85</td>       <td>0.40</td>       <td>3.42</td>       <td>12.82</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>0.82</td>       <td>1.98</td>       <td>1.62</td>       <td>4.06</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>2.83</td>       <td>4.47</td>       <td>10.10</td>       <td>12.76</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin</td>       <td>5.66</td>       <td>19.31</td>       <td>67.53</td>       <td>52.51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>1.61</td>       <td>2.17</td>       <td>4.27</td>       <td>13.57</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>2.38</td>       <td>2.65</td>       <td>29.39</td>       <td>27.41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>0.72</td>       <td>1.05</td>       <td>6.37</td>       <td>10.28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>2.23</td>       <td>4.11</td>       <td>15.63</td>       <td>21.79</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>0.25</td>       <td>0.73</td>       <td>24.19</td>       <td>42.91</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In 2019, local authorities, working in partnership with Approved Housing Bodies, delivered more than 10,000 (10,007) new social homes nationwide utilising the mechanisms of Build (6,074), Acquisition (2,772) and Leasing (1,161). </p><p>Families and individuals in the private rented sector were also supported through the Housing Assistance Payment and schemes such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-20a.3874.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1554" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000168#WRYYY01600"><p>To qualify for HAP, a household must be qualified for social housing support by their local authority, which means the household must qualify to go on the local authority housing waiting list. HAP tenants find their own accommodation in the private rented market and are advised that this accommodation should be within the HAP rent limits provided to them by the local authority. The limits applicable are related to the specific household and the rental market in the area. As HAP also allows for tenants to work full-time and retain their housing support, in many cases people may make choices about affordability taking this into consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord beyond that of their HAP payment. However, decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation, is solely a matter for the local authority concerned and local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.</p>  <p>   Local authorities have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of, homelessness. The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households faces in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.  </p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. </p>  <p>  Under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, the Government introduced additional supports and protections for renters, beyond the income supports already agreed with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The Act provides for amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2019, which will operate for a period of 3 months from 27 March 2020. Provision has also been made for this period to be extended, if the Government considers it appropriate to do so. </p>  <p>   A notice of termination cannot be served during the COVID&ndash;19 emergency period.  All notices of termination which were served before the emergency period are paused and tenants, in general, cannot be obliged to leave their rented accommodation during this time.  Similarly, all notices of rent increase which were served before the emergency period and were due to take effect during this period, are paused. While tenants are obliged to pay rent during the COVID&ndash;19 emergency period, landlords are not permitted to increase the amount of rent payable during this period.</p>  <p>  Where HAP tenants are not financially impacted by the COVID-19 measures, they are expected to continue to pay their HAP differential rent.  However, if tenants&rsquo; circumstances change, the local authority should reassess those tenants and adjust their differential rent accordingly. </p>  <p>  Local authorities have been requested to ensure that HAP tenants newly in receipt of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) supports be facilitated in remaining in their HAP tenancies. If amendments cannot be made immediately to a tenant&rsquo;s differential rent amount, any arrears accumulating from the date of approval of the new DEASP support should be rectified at a later date.   This will not affect the HAP payment to the landlord.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and it is considered to be a key vehicle in meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

It is available in all local authority areas and its introduction ensures that all social housing supports can be accessed through the local authorities.</p><p>HAP will replace Rent Supplement (RS) for those with a long-term housing need who qualify for social housing support. However, RS will remain available through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) to households as a short-term income support. </p><p>HAP provides fast, flexible housing support to all eligible households in the area of their choice. Individuals, who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP and avail of full-time employment and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent.</p><p>HAP plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals. At the end of Q4 2019 there were more than 52,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP. </p><p>A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement specifically with a HAP recipient. However, on 1 January 2016, the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 introduced &ldquo;housing assistance&rdquo; as a new discriminatory ground. This means that discrimination in the provision of accommodation or related service and amenities against people in receipt of rent supplement, HAP or other social welfare payments is prohibited. Further information is available at</p><p><i></i></p><p>If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission; further information is available on the Commission's website,  </p><p>Administration of the HAP scheme is a matter for the relevant local authority. The transfer of existing long-term rent supplement tenancies is continuing, with ongoing engagement between local authorities and local DEASP offices. Failure of a landlord to participate in HAP should not affect an existing customer&rsquo;s entitlement to rent supplement, provided that the tenant has engaged with the local authority and/or Community Welfare Officer within the HAP transfer process.</p></reply>

There are currently no plans to review any of these formats in light of the COVID-19 pandemic but my Department will continue to monitor existing policy measures and activities, having regard to the most up to date Government public health advice and guidance, as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.</p></reply>

The planning system facilitates the regulation of such short-term letting uses undertaken by the individual carrying out the activity, i.e. the owner/occupier of the house or apartment, rather than the online platforms. </p>  <p>  Under the Short-Term Letting legislation applicable in rent pressure zones:</p>  <p>  - Short term letting is defined as the letting of a house or apartment, or part of a house or apartment, for any period not exceeding 14 days.</p>  <p>  - Homesharing (the letting of a room or rooms in a person&rsquo;s principal private residence) continues to be permissible on an unrestricted basis and is exempted from the new planning requirements.</p>  <p>  - Homesharers are allowed to sub-let their entire principle private residence (house or apartment) on a short term basis for a cumulative period of 90 days where they are temporarily absent from their home.</p>  <p>  - Where the 90 day threshold is exceeded, change of use planning permission is required.</p>  <p>  If a person homeshares their principal private residence in a rent pressure zone and wishes to avail of the new planning exemptions, they need to register this with their local planning authority and fulfil specified reporting obligations.</p>  <p>  However, where a person owns a property in a rent pressure zone which is not their principal private residence and intends to let it for short term letting purposes, s/he is required to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes.</p>  <p>  The broader regulation of tourism activity, including the possible development of a new regulatory or licensing/registration system for commercial platforms and short-term letting agents - which was  recommended in the final Working Group report on the regulation of short-term lettings - is beyond the scope of the planning code and my remit.  However, I have previously written to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, outlining the recommendations made by the Working Group and highlighting the measures taken by my Department to act upon these recommendations, specifically the introduction of the short-term letting legislation. I advised the Minister that the remaining recommendations of the Working Group fell under the remit of his Department to action, and assured him of my support, and that of my Department, in addressing these outstanding recommendations.</p>  <p>  The extent of former short-term rental stock which has become available during the COVID-19 Emergency has highlighted the need for a more sustainable regulatory regime for this form of accommodation, which meets the needs of both the tourism and housing sectors.  It will be a matter for the incoming Government, and particularly the incoming Minister with responsibility for the tourism sector, to decide on any further actions it may wish to take in relation to the possible regulation of online platforms.</p>  <p>  As part of the immediate response to COVID-19, a number of properties formerly available as short-term lets were secured by local authorities to provide accommodation for households experiencing homelessness. The level of enquiries to local authorities indicates that there are considerable numbers of properties which have been previously rented as tourist accommodation.  Local authorities are engaging with property owners in relation to the use of such properties for longer-term social housing, including long-term leasing.   Given the number of households on the social housing waiting list, including the number of households in homeless emergency accommodation, it is important that as many of these properties as possible are converted from tourist accommodation to homes.  My Department will be continuing to work with the local authorities to support this work in the coming weeks and months.</p></reply>

This was an important first step in the Government's assessment as to the impact of the Eurostat decision. The Department of Finance undertook an analysis of the implications for General Government Expenditure and General Government Debt and concluded that there are no direct Exchequer implications and the projections do not present any particular issue in the context of the fiscal rules.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has been engaging with AHB sector representative bodies (namely, the Irish Council for Social Housing and the Housing Alliance) and examining, in detail, proposals, including proposals which were presented by those bodies, as a possible means to achieve reclassification. The proposals are complex as they cut across a wide range of social housing policy issues and require extensive analysis. </p>  <p>  An important part of this exercise is to examine the feasibility of measures which can be taken to develop the AHB sector in such as way so that it could be reclassified as being 'off-balance sheet', without undermining the foundations of social housing policy. In this context, it must be accepted that this will more likely be a more longer term objective.  </p>  <p>  Constructive discussions have taken place with AHB representative bodies on a number of occasions and are informing a pathway for dealing with the issues involved. It was agreed that a working group would be established to consider these issues further. </p>  <p>  Although that group has not yet had the opportunity to formally meet, work is continuing on this matter and my Department continues to engage with all stakeholders and to liaise with the Department of Finance and the Central Statistics Office to ensure any new or additional information can be brought forward for consideration. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the decision by Eurostat, the Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to the delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland. It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain the momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the Action Plan. I have communicated to both the local authorities and the AHB sector that this statistical classification will not affect ambitious plans under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

Cost rental is housing which does not include a profit margin and therefore rents can be set at a level that only needs to cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes. </p>  <p>  I have established a working group involving my Department, the Land Development Agency (LDA), the Housing Agency and other expert bodies, which is developing a policy framework for the cost rental model and examining how a sustainable financing structure can be established to commence delivery of homes at the scale required to get this new category of housing established.  Detailed operational and eligibility criteria for cost rental will be informed by this evidence building and policy work.  The work of this group will also be assisted by research and other support that is being undertaken by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on behalf of my Department, drawing on the EIB's extensive international experience in this area.</p>  <p>  My Department's work on cost rental is also being supported by two pilot projects, at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore and at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown. The latter of these has already commenced construction, supported by EIB funding, and the first homes are anticipated to come on stream from 2021.  Additionally, the LDA and some local authorities are actively considering cost rental as an option for sites within their land portfolios.  An example of this can be seen in the planning application which has been submitted for lands in Shanganagh in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, where the LDA will work in partnership with the County Council to deliver over 350 cost rental homes. </p>  <p>  The selection of further sites for cost rental consideration will be informed by emerging policy and by the financial and operational model that will be developed from the work outlined above.</p></reply>

The LDA is also subject to the requirements of the Public Spending Code.  </p>  <p>  In line with its establishment order, the LDA is currently governed by an interim Board.  On enactment of the legislation expected later this year, a Board for the LDA will be appointed in accordance with the Guidelines on the Appointment to State Boards.  The Board provides ongoing strategic direction and oversight in regard to the LDA&rsquo;s activities and ensures that it complies with all corporate governance and transparency provisions. The Board is also responsible for the completion of an Annual Report each year on the activities of the Agency and the report for 2019 will be published in the coming months.</p>  <p>  In line with the Code of Practice, the LDA and my Department meet on a regular basis to ensure that my Department is updated on the work of the Agency and to discuss other relevant issues.  There is currently a Memorandum of Understanding in place between my Department and the LDA to cover the interim period until the primary legislation is enacted.   Following this, the LDA will be subject to the usual Departmental oversight arrangements for Commercial State Agencies as set out under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has engaged with NewERA to provide financial and commercial advice in relation to the operations of the LDA.   Furthermore, the legislation will provide that the LDA will be subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, with such audits being examinable by the Public Accounts Committee.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the LDA, as a public body, is subject to the Freedom of Information (FOI) Acts.</p></reply>

Any option proposed by a local authority for the delivery of public housing, whether based on a public works contract or development agreement, must comply with the Public Spending Code, particularly in terms of obtaining the best possible value for money.  </p>  <p>  The majority of local authority public housing projects continue to be developed using public works contracts and while development agreements have been little used to date, I am aware of their intended use by Dublin City Council in relation to the O'Devaney Gardens project and their proposed use in relation to the Oscar Traynor Road site. Depending on the decisions and approaches followed by local authorities, development agreements may be suitable for large-scale, mixed-tenure developments.  But irrespective of the approach used, it remains the case under the Public Spending Code that local authorities conduct a financial and economic appraisal, which is submitted to my Department as the Approving Authority under the Code.</p></reply>

The households also received payment from the colleges. </p>  <p>  These colleges are recognised as a vital part of the social and economic infrastructure of the Gaeltacht with up to 27,000 students attending over 40 colleges and staying with one of the 700 Gaeltacht families registered to provide accommodation. The sector is estimated to generate c. &euro;50m of economic activity for Gaeltacht areas, given its wider impact on hotels, B&amp;Bs, restaurants and public houses when parents visit their children.</p>  <p>  Since the onset of the pandemic, both I and my officials have met on a number of occasions with the colleges&rsquo; representative organisation, CONCOS, with a view to identifying the financial pressure points for the sector in order to ensure the survival of this important sector for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht and the cultural life of the country as a whole.  While the question of repayment of deposits to those who have reserved places on courses scheduled for summer 2020 is primarily one for the colleges concerned, the matter is being actively considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

Accordingly, we cannot comment on this case beyond the facts below:</p>  <p>  Following a report from a concerned landowner in West Cork, in early January this year, NPWS field staff collected 12 dead birds of prey  which the landowner had come across in one of his fields. Subsequent searches of the general area by NPWS located 11 further dead birds. </p>  <p>  While the investigation is still ongoing, NPWS are of the view that this case is an example of deliberate poisoning of wildlife, and are confident that this incident was not related to any agricultural practices in the area, nor with the landowner. I am grateful to the landowner for alerting the NPWS to this very serious incident, and local field staff are continuing with the intensive investigation into this case, including continued monitoring of the area, with a view to determining the source.  </p>  <p>  Testing of the carcasses was carried out by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Cork which confirmed that the cause of death was the banned insecticide Carbofuran. The use of Carbofuran products in agriculture has been banned in Ireland since June 2009.</p>  <p>  The chemical had been shown worldwide to be toxic to much wildlife, but particularly toxic to birds. While it is no longer legally available anywhere in Europe, it is known to be illegally procured and used by that minority of people who persecute wildlife, particularly birds of prey. </p>  <p>  My Department has successfully prosecuted offenders who employed this method previously. NPWS Regional staff launched an intensive investigation and the Gardai at Bandon Garda Station were also alerted to the incident. Subsequent searches of the general area did not result in any further findings of mortalities leaving the total recorded mortalities from this incident at 23.</p>  <p>  As this is an open on-going legal investigation, it would not be appropriate to comment further on this case.</p></reply>

The company itself has now declared their intention to double that figure on foot of new contracts confirmed recently. </p>  <p>  The sale is being progressed currently in accordance with the appropriate procedures as laid down for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the disposal of property and lands in its ownership. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has confirmed that following full assessment of the expansion proposals from the client company the sale of the property as part of the job creation package was deemed appropriate in order to ensure permanency and investment in this expansion phase.</p>  <p>  As per the appropriate procedure, two independent valuations were received in order to ascertain the current market value of the building at the time of the sale. The higher of these valuations was selected and approved by the Board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s as the minimum sale price for the property, subject to the property being used for enterprise and job creation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Donegal Gaeltacht and the Gaoth Dobhair area in particular has experienced significant job losses in the past which resulted in the establishment by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta of an employment taskforce in the recent past to develop proposals in order to increase employment opportunities in the area.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant efforts of this taskforce and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in actively seeking tenants or investors for the building, the former Sn&aacute;th Comer factory has been empty since 2004 and has not been upgraded in any way during that period. This sale and expansion is a positive development for the Gaoth Dobhair area, which will see cutting edge research, development and innovation, and manufacturing taking place in this factory once again and most importantly, a proposed workforce in excess of 160 people in total. </p>  <p>  This development is integral to the future growth of the company in question and facilitates its ability to secure new contracts, expand the workforce and produce new products in Gaoth Dobhair. The building will need to be renovated as well as being extended to allow for the installation of the appropriate machinery as and when required and the company itself will complete those works.  </p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has confirmed that 14 sales of buildings, enterprise units/sub-units, or parcels of land have been completed in the County Donegal Gaeltacht over the last 10 years. </p>  <p>  The sale of enterprise property to client companies with an appropriate business model, resources, structure and profile is a long-established successful method by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and other development organisations to ensure longevity, sustainability and investment by companies in creating employment in rural Gaeltacht areas.</p>  <p>  At a time of global uncertainty, it is encouraging to see companies that are willing to innovate, develop and especially invest in their own local areas and to look to create new employment opportunities. </p></reply>

The team also conducts patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of national and EU legislation and investigate reports of breaches of legislation including the various types of wildlife crime I have already described. My Department works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are also specifically empowered under the Acts to investigate alleged wildlife crime offences and to prosecute as they see fit.  </p>  <p>  In the period 2013 to date in 2020 some 90 prosecutions were taken by my Department for breaches of the Wildlife Acts ranging from illegal deer and hare hunting, the cutting of hedges and vegetation and the poisoning of bird species.  I will arrange for Deputy Whitmore to receive a yearly breakdown of prosecutions since 2010.   These cases are heard in District Courts and my Department has issued press statements on individual cases over the years.   For example, in 2019 my Department issued some 10 press statements on successful wildlife crime prosecutions.   While bringing perpetrators of crime to justice is important, the success of dealing with wildlife crime cannot be judged on this alone, as ensuring compliance in the first instance is clearly of critical importance.</p>  <p>  Given concerns about wildlife crime, an internal Wildlife Crime Group made up of senior Departmental officials and regional field staff has been established and meets regularly.   The primary purpose of the Group is to ensure that the NPWS can realise its enforcement functions under the Wildlife Acts and European legislation as effectively as possible including consideration of how working with other agencies and organisations can enable the Department to fulfil its functions in tackling wildlife crime.   </p>  <p>  The Wildlife Crime Group has pursued many important initiatives including the organisation of a major Wildlife Crime Conference in 2018 which was attended by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives from organisations in Britain and Northern Ireland dealing with wildlife crime. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that we continue with vigour our  actions to tackle wildlife crime including incidents such as the recent killing of buzzards in Co Cork and to working with other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the I.S.P.C.A to counteract these illegal activities.</p></reply>

Subsequent searches of the general area by NPWS located 11 further dead buzzards.</p>  <p>  Testing of the carcasses was carried out by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Cork which confirmed that the cause of death was the banned insecticide Carbofuran. The use of Carbofuran products in agriculture has been banned in Ireland since June 2009.   The chemical had been shown worldwide to be toxic to much wildlife, but particularly toxic to birds. While it is no longer legally available in the European Union, it is known to be illegally procured and used by that minority of people who persecute wildlife, particularly birds of prey. </p>  <p>  On learning of the incident, NPWS Regional staff immediately launched an intensive investigation and the Gardai at Bandon Garda Station were also alerted to the incident. More recent searches of the general area did not result in any further findings of buzzard mortalities leaving the total recorded mortalities from this incident at 23.</p>  <p>  While the investigation is still ongoing, it is the view of NPWS that this incident was not related to any agricultural practices in the area, nor with the landowner but rather that it is a case of deliberate poisoning of wildlife. </p>  <p>  Buzzards are a species that became extinct in Ireland the late 19th century. Having re-established themselves in Northern Ireland in the 1930&rsquo;s, they have steadily colonised many counties in Ireland and have now become a welcome addition to Ireland&rsquo;s avian biodiversity. Incidents such as this impede this recolonisation and are to be condemned not least at a time when the awareness and appreciation of the value of our biodiversity is on the increase.     </p>  <p>  I am very grateful to the landowner for alerting us to this very serious incident, and local field staff are continuing with the intensive investigation into this case, including continued monitoring of the area, with a view to determining the source.  </p>  <p>  My Department has provided funding for satellite tags for research on the movements of some of the introduced birds of prey and hen harrier and these have provided important information on poisoning. In relation to the Raptor Protocol, this is a collaborative approach between my Department, the Regional Veterinary Laboratories, and the State Laboratory to systematically determine the extent to which human actions (for example poisoning, persecution, disturbance, collisions, etc.) are threats to Ireland's native birds of prey.   My Department issues an on-line report annually providing records, information and analysis of mortality and persecution of birds of prey.   Details relating to the poisoning of the buzzards in West Cork, which I have already stated came to my Department&rsquo;s attention in January this year, will be included in the Raptor Protocol Report for 2020.</p></reply>

In this regard a number of awards where the money was not committed have been reallocated to a new suite of programmes (including expanded bursary, commission and professional development awards) designed to sustain the ecology to the end of the year, while also offering  support which enables artists to develop work and supports arts workers enhancing their skill set. This new proposed approach has been informed by these recent sectorial surveys as well as the Council&rsquo;s own strategic objectives. Progress is also continuing with College of Education residences and with writer in residence programmes in a number of universities.  These had been initiated before the onset of Covid 19. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to engage with the agencies under its remit and other sectorial stakeholders to ensure that there is the greatest level of awareness of the supports that have been made available by Government and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to best support the sector at this challenging time.</p></reply>

The Roadmap started from 18 May and the plan sets out five phases for unlocking restrictions, at three week intervals. At all times we will be guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team and each three week interval will see a review of public health situation. </p>  <p>  The Roadmap will see museums, galleries, and other cultural outlets re-open under Phase 4 of the roadmap from the 20th of July, but only where people can move freely with appropriate social distancing maintained and strict hand hygiene is enforced on entry. Theatres and cinemas may open under Phase 5 of the plan, subject to the maintenance of social distancing.  The constraints and restrictions which are now part of life pose challenges for everyone working and this is equally true in the cultural sector in adapting venues and buildings to ensure public health is protected.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Roadmap, a National Protocol has been finalised by Government, employers and trade unions, with the assistance of the Health and Safety Authority, which will support a gradual restart of economic activity as restrictions are eased, while protecting the health and safety of workers as they return to work. </p>  <p>  The Protocol has been developed following discussions at the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF), which is the forum for high level dialogue between Government, Union and Employer representatives on matters of strategic national importance. </p>  <p>  Preparatory work is also being undertaken by many individual groups, bodies and agencies in relation to the safe re-opening of workplaces and facilities.  </p>  <p>  The Arts Council has asked its recently appointed Advisory Group to assess how arts organisations can emerge from lockdown, implementing hygiene and social distancing protocols as necessary, and how in due course, to safely return to public attendance and participation under advice from the relevant authorities. </p>  <p>  Nationally, the collective impact of increasing access and mobility will have to be continually assessed.  Final responsibility for assessing the readiness of a venue or facility will rest with the relevant employers\operators in each case.</p></reply>

The scheme is predicated on the employer wanting to keep employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picks up by enabling employees, whose employers are affected by the pandemic, to receive significant supports directly from their employer through the payroll system. The scheme is expected to last 12 weeks from 26 March 2020 and will cover 70% of the net salary of workers, up to a maximum of &euro;410 per week.</p>  <p>  These two schemes are in addition to the normal state supports that remain in place.</p>  <p>  There is nothing in the legislation excluding any sector or profession in the economy.  Equally freelance and/or self-employed people can qualify for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  My Department provides a helpdesk advice facility on income support for individuals at artsunit@chg.gov.ie and I would encourage people in the sector to make contact for advice.</p></reply>

Priority is being given towards supporting the artists and arts workers.  These matters will receive further consideration in the context of the recovery phase. </p>  <p>  Following a meeting I convened on 12 March with the Arts Council, the National Cultural Institutions and Screen Ireland, the Arts Council announced a series of immediate measures, including an undertaking to honour all funding commitments made to organisations and allow grantees to draw down up to 90% of their funding commitment. To facilitate this, my Department advanced payment of the annual allocation to the Arts Council. These measures were taken to ensure grantees could continue to operate and meet their financial commitments, particularly to individual artists. The measures provided much needed support to arts and cultural organisations and, more importantly, those working in the sector. </p>  <p>  I announced measures on 3 April to enable artists and cultural workers to share their work through alternative channels and this included the Arts Council&rsquo;s Covid-19 crisis response award, and the Ireland Performs grant from Culture Ireland and Facebook Ireland. The Covid-19 crisis response award of &euro;3,000 per grantee supports the creation and dissemination of new artistic work for the public benefit and was jointly funded by the Arts Council and my Department.  </p>  <p>  The Arts Council is in daily contact with a broad range of artists and organisations to understand how COVID-19 is impacting the sector The Council continues to operate fully throughout the COVID-19 crisis to support artists and arts organisations through this difficult time. Regular updates are being provided on its website and on social media channel.  </p>  <p>  The Arts Council has based its  response to Covid-19 on sectorial engagement which includes surveying, focus groups and other forms of interaction with funded and non-funded organisations and individual artists. </p>  <p>  The Council has also undertaken a detailed survey of arts organisations to identify the impact on audiences, employment and finances for March, April and May as well as a survey of artists seeking information of the economic impact on individual artists. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to engage with the agencies under its remit and other sectorial stakeholders to ensure that there is the greatest level of awareness of the supports that have been made available by Government and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to best support the sector at this challenging time. </p>  <p>  The Department has also engaged on a bilateral basis with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on social welfare supports, with the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation on liquidity and other supports for businesses, and is engaged on an ongoing basis with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on all aspects of the impacts of the crisis on the sector. </p>  <p>  More recently, officials form my Department met with commercial interests on the plans for reopening in line with the Government's Roadmap.</p></reply>
