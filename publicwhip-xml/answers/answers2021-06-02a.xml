Our discussions focused on ways our two Governments can continue to work together to support all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and promote peace and prosperity on both a North/South and East/West basis. We also discussed issues around implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p><p>We discussed the long journey of the Ballymurphy families for justice to vindicate the innocence of their loved ones. In this context I emphasised the importance of the British Government responding to the families in a way that recognises the gravity of the findings which categorically established that ten innocent people were killed. </p><p>As well as discussing Ballymurphy specifically, Prime Minister Johnson and I spoke about legacy issues, and of how best to secure progress and answers for the many families who have been pursuing truth and justice now for far too many years. </p><p>I was clear with the Prime Minister that every family bereaved in the conflict should have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.  The Stormont House Agreement framework allows for the crucial elements we need &ndash; investigations, truth recovery, oral history, reconciliation and acknowledgement.</p><p>While the Government is ready to engage and work with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties in relation to any concerns around the aspects of the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, I made clear that this must be a collaborative and collective process.</p><p>I also made clear that unilateral action cannot be the basis of any sustainable way forward.  </p><p>We will continue to engage with the UK Government on this. </p><p>We also discussed British-Irish relations, and we are both ambitious for the development of the next phase of the bilateral relationship framed around a number of areas of common interest, including research and innovation, sport, and tackling climate change. </p><p>We had a good exchange on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the value of working together. </p><p>The Prime Minister and I agreed to remain in close touch over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Statement of Strategy has been developed with particular reference to the immediate challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit but my Department will continue to be responsive to new and emerging challenges in the future.</p></reply>

A Working Group chaired by my Department and involving a broad range of Government departments, the Central Statistics Office, and the National Economic and Social Council is also supporting this work. </p><p>The development of the Framework is being further enhanced by consultation and broader engagement. The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) is leading this process through a subgroup of stakeholders and experts for this purpose.</p><p>The development of the Framework will be an iterative process and evolve over time.

I understand that in the period 24th &ndash; 27th May, presenters encountered slow response times when filing on the system at times during the day.  </p>  <p>  The Registrar appreciates the difficulties and frustrations experienced by some during this period and, as soon as the issue came to light, the CRO commenced work on identifying the cause of the difficulties with a view to having them addressed as soon as possible. The Registrar also took the decision on 27th May to further extend the filing deadline for relevant companies until 11th June, to give them and their professional advisors the time necessary to fulfil their filing obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the difficulties experienced by some, it is worth pointing out that there was a significant level of filing during the affected period last week with over 14,000 annual returns filed.  I understand that the system has been operating satisfactorily in recent days and no performance issues have been reported after Thursday 27th May.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by the Registrar that the CRO is continuing to work to identify the cause of the difficulties with a view to ensuring that similar delays are not encountered in the future. In the meantime, presenters are encouraged to continue filing on the system over the coming period and in advance of the 11th June deadline.</p></reply>

The report is built on three pillars which are bolstered by underpinning conditions. These pillars are:</p><p>1. Create a Conducive Environment </p><p>2. Develop and Leverage a Remote Work Infrastructure</p><p>3. Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework </p><p>Under these pillars and the underpinning conditions there are 15 actions to progress remote working into the future. The Strategy outlines the Departments and State Agencies responsible for the delivery of each of the actions. Each of these actions has a deadline of Q1, 3, or 4 of this year. </p><p>My Department is leading on the implementation of the Strategy. Lead actors report the progress on their actions to the Interdepartmental Group on Remote Work. This Group has met twice to date this year, with the most recent meeting taking place last week, on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  At this meeting it was established that actions to date have been met and that progress is underway to achieving the remaining actions by the end of the year. The Group will continue to meet as the year progresses to drive the implementation of the Strategy.</p><p>Notable actions already progressed include the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect, which is now in place, and a public consultation on the Right to Request Remote Working.</p></reply>

Drafting is currently underway with a view to enactment in advance of the summer recess. Officials from my Department continue to engage intensively with the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel to progress the Bill within this timeframe. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that Ireland&rsquo;s existing rescue framework, examinership, while internationally recognised and successful in its own right, may be beyond the reach of small companies due to the associated costs. The Small Company Administrative Rescue Process (SCARP) seeks to mirror key elements of examinership in an administrative context thereby reducing court oversight resulting in efficiencies and lower comparable costs. It will have limited court involvement where creditors are engaged in the process and positively disposed to a rescue plan. </p>  <p>  SCARP is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s medium-term stabilisation response to the economic challenges of the pandemic, and in keeping with commitments contained in the Programme for Government.  It is a further demonstration of its commitment to do all that it can to help businesses along the road to recovery as we emerge from Covid-19. </p></reply>

These loans may be used for liquidity as well as for investment purposes, which means that this support may be of assistance to businesses in need of liquidity support post-lockdown. These loans are available at interest rates below market value for similar loans without a State guarantee.</p><p>The COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme makes relatively short-term working capital lending available to pandemic-impacted businesses. Loans under this scheme must be used to innovate, change or adapt in response to the impacts of the pandemic. These loans are offered for terms of up to three years, at a maximum interest rate of 4%. Per-county uptake figures for this scheme are made available as part of quarterly reports on the scheme.

Per-county uptake figures for this scheme are made available as part of quarterly reports on the scheme. The most recent report is that to the end of Q4 2020.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was launched in 2019 and was expanded by &euro;500m in July of 2020. This scheme makes available up to &euro;800m in lending to assist long term, strategic investment by eligible businesses, including in response to Brexit and COVID-19.

The Action Plan for Insurance Reform was published on December 8<sup>th</sup>and sets out 66 actions across Government to bring down the cost of insurance for consumers and business.</p><p>Actions for my own Department under the Action Plan are set out as follows:</p><p>- Enhancing the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board </p><p>My colleague the Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation, has met regularly with PIAB and a range of representative bodies to assess the role of PIAB and develop proposals to enhance and reform the agency. The Minister has undertaken a public consultation seeking views on the matter from all interested parties. There has been very good engagement with the consultation and we are now concluding the examination of the responses with a view to introducing legislation to enhance and reform PIAB.</p><p>As set out in the Plan the new Personal Injuries Guidelines came into effect on the 24<sup>th</sup>April. These Guidelines apply to all cases assessed by PIAB from that date. The new Guidelines clearly represent a shift in the manner in which general damages are awarded in our country and in the level of those damages and should exert downward pressure on insurance premiums. </p><p>In addition, the Minister for Justice along with Minister Troy, published the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Bill 2021 in April 2021. This Bill will bring Garda compensation claims within the PIAB process. This will benefit both claimants, in terms of quicker resolution of claims with an objective assessment of quantum, and the State as the respondent, in terms of lower legal and administrative costs.</p><p>- Strengthening the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)</p><p>On the 22<sup>nd</sup>December 2020 Government approved the General Scheme of the Competition (Amendment) Bill. This Bill represents a step change in competition enforcement for Ireland and will give the CCPC more effective enforcement powers to punish anti-competitive conduct. The Bill has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is currently undergoing drafting with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  </p><p><b>- </b>Working together with the Department of Finance to establish an office within government to encourage greater competition in the insurance market</p><p>A new office to promote competition in the insurance market has been established within the Department of Finance, supported by my Department and chaired by the Minister for Financial Services, Credit Unions and Insurance. The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also involved in exploring opportunities for new entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. This Office will provide a more coordinated Government policy approach to promote competition in the insurance sector.</p><p>Under the Action Plan my Department is also continuing to oversee the implementation of the remaining Personal Injury Commission&rsquo;s recommendations by relevant bodies. </p><p>The Government wants a competitive, stable and consumer-friendly insurance environment. The Action Plan for Insurance Reform is one of the most important programmes that this Government will undertake. Implementation of the Plan is on track and I will shortly chair a meeting of the Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform to assess progress. The full implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform will help to ensure that we have an insurance system which is both affordable and reliable and one which underpins a vibrant economy. </p></reply>

While no specific targets for emissions and removals from land use currently exist, this will change with the application of a new EU land-use accounting system, under the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation (LULUCF).</p>  <p>  Under this Regulation, emissions and removals will be assessed over two consecutive accounting periods, the first from 2021 to 2025, and the second from 2026 to 2030. The LULUCF Regulation requires EU Member States to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions from the land use sector are offset by at least an equivalent removal of CO₂ from the sector for the period 2021 to 2030, based on defined benchmarks. This commitment is referred to as the "no debit rule".  </p>  <p>  Should Ireland satisfy the &ldquo;no debit rule&rdquo; as outlined above, Ireland can avail of credits through additional removals in the LULUCF sectors that may be transferred to assist in meeting the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which sets binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for Member States for the period 2021-2030. These targets concern sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. The ESR sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. In meeting this target, a credit/flexibility of up to 26.8Mt CO2eq is available to Ireland under the LULUCF Regulation. As emissions and removals from peatlands, under Managed Wetlands, form a part of the LULUCF sector, their improved management could help Ireland achieve this flexibility.</p></reply>

The Just Transition Fund will invest in specific projects that will contribute to alleviating the impact of the transition by financing the diversification and modernisation of the local economy and by mitigating the negative repercussions on employment.   </p>  <p>  In order to access the Just Transition Fund, Ireland must prepare a Territorial Just Transition Plan for approval by the European Commission. The Territorial Plan will define the regions eligible for funding and the measures to be funded, in line with the relevant EU regulation.  The criteria used to select projects will depend on design of individual measures to be supported under the Territorial Plan. It is expected that this Territorial Plan will be completed and submitted to the European Commission in the second half of 2021. </p></reply>

My Department has, however, raised a query regarding the premises in question with the service provider to get the current status for the location and has confirmed that the premises is not receiving speeds of 30 Mbps.Officials in my Department are examining a number of premises, including this one, and will ensure that access to high speed broadband is made available, either through commercial means or through the National Broadband Plan intervention. Where appropriate and if compliant with State aid rules, premises may be reclassified as AMBER on the high speed broadband map. Before reclassification of a premises can be confirmed, it must first go through a formal review process. This is to ensure that the State is compliant with State Aid rules and the State aid approval which enabled the contract to be awarded under the National Broadband Plan.  </p><p>The NBP High Speed Broadband Map is dynamic. This means that the intervention area can be updated to reflect new commercial plans, or previous plans that have failed to materialise. This flexibility allows for an increase or decrease in the number of premises included in the State Intervention area, if appropriate to do so.</p></reply>

A number of steps as part of our overall approach to solar energy are under way.  </p>  <p>  The development of grid scale solar energy has been sharply accelerated in Ireland through the first Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS-1) auction, which included a dedicated solar category. In RESS-1, 51 solar projects, equating to approximately 631MW of new renewable energy capacity, have entered into implementation agreements as set out in the terms and conditions of the scheme. Detailed planning is now underway for the second onshore RESS auction, RESS-2.</p>  <p>  In addition, a Micro-Generation Working Group, chaired by my Department, is examining an enabling framework for micro-generation, including from solar PV, which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments. The proposed support mechanism was outlined in a Public Consultation which closed on 18th February last. An analysis of these submissions is underway by my Department with a view to publishing a summary of submissions and the submissions themselves on the Department&rsquo;s website in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable electricity users to meet their own electricity needs, it is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewable generators in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has been working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on a revision to the exemptions for solar installations under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 that would reduce the barriers to micro and small-scale rooftop solar PV and open up exemptions to new building types including educational, community and apartment buildings. It is expected that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will bring forward the required amendments to the Regulations later this year. </p></reply>

I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that as at the 27 May over 220,000 premises have been surveyed across all counties. </p><p>This survey work has enabled detailed designs to be developed for each deployment area. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir, where Open eir ensures any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence.</p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected in Carrigaline, Co Cork and Cavan with almost 4,000 premises passed and available for connection to date. Premises in Galway and Limerick are expected to be available for connection in the coming months. I am advised that build works are continuing across the country in 12 deployment areas covering townlands in Carrigaline, Ballinasloe, Cavan, Clare, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick Monaghan, Roscommon, Tipperary, Tralee, Wexford and Carlow. In addition, &quot;make ready&quot; work is underway in a further 15 Deployment Areas.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 27th May, 317 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. </p><p>My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at <i>nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</i>.</p></reply>

It will also provide for the direct export of surplus Irish renewable energy to mainland Europe, and a reduction in curtailment of wind generation in Ireland, including costs associated with this curtailment for Irish consumers. </p>  <p>  As an EU Project of Common Interest (PCI), the Celtic Interconnector was awarded a &euro;530m grant under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) in 2019, which will cover approximately 50% of the project&rsquo;s total estimated costs. This grant was made possible by significant support for the project from the Irish Government that resulted in its designation as an EU PCI.</p>  <p>  The importance of the Celtic Interconnector to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives, and Government commitment to completing its development, is highlighted in the Programme for Government. Support from the Irish and French Governments for this project was reaffirmed in the Joint Declaration at a meeting between Foreign Ministers in Dublin in May 2021. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for developing the Celtic Interconnector is primarily a matter for the project promoter, EirGrid. Following extensive planning by EirGrid and a period of public consultation during 2020, a decision was arrived at by EirGrid regarding the location of interconnector infrastructure in East Cork, pending required approval by Irish planning authorities. A further decision was arrived at by EirGrid regarding the establishment of an enhanced community benefit scheme for impacted communities. According to EirGrid, applications for the required foreshore licence and onshore planning permissions in Ireland will be submitted in summer 2021.</p></reply>

In addition, the review recommended that in the longer term, the Government should seek to engage with its EU partners on the validity of a separate target for biogenic methane.  </p><p>With the 2030 Climate Target Plan and EU Climate Law, the EU will raise its ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. This is a substantial increase compared to the existing 40% emissions reduction target. The Commission is preparing to present, by July 2021, an overhaul of all relevant climate legislation as part of a &ldquo;Fit for 55 Package&rdquo; to align with the newly proposed target.</p><p>Ireland fully supports the enhanced ambition at EU level. It is consistent with the national approach, as the Programme for Government commits to achieve net zero emissions by no later than 2050 and a 51% emissions reduction by 2030.</p><p>Ireland has agreed with other Member States that the Commission should swiftly put forward its legislative package, together with an in-depth examination of the environmental, economic and social impact at Member State level. It will be important that the updated EU 2030 target of at least 55% is delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, balancing considerations of fairness, cost effectiveness and solidarity, and ensuring that no one is left behind.</p><p>With respect to the longer term, the new EU Climate Law lists a number of considerations the Commission must take into account when proposing the Unions 2040 Climate Target. In doing so, the Commission must consider, amongst other matters <i>&ldquo;the best available </i>and most recent scientific evidence, including the latest reports of the IPCC and the Advisory Board&rdquo;.

While this will be challenging, it will lead to improvements in our health, welfare and security.  </p>  <p>  The level of change envisaged cannot be avoided, with the evidence for warming of our climate system and its destructive impact now beyond dispute. The EU recognises this, and aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and be climate-neutral by 2050. This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU&rsquo;s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement. </p>  <p>  In terms of the costs and challenges of a transformation of this scale, it is not possible to detail them all out to 2050. In fact the Programme for Government recognises that we are not yet in a position to identify all the emerging technologies, changing scientific consensus or policies to meet our full ambition. It is also recognised that the taxpayer cannot compensate for all the actions that have to be taken, and that it is essential the burdens borne are seen to be fair and that every group makes an appropriate level of effort.</p>  <p>  The 2021 Climate Action Plan, which will give effect to the Programme for Government step-up in climate ambition, is to be completed this Summer. It will seek to identify the least cost pathways that minimise the burdens and maximise the opportunities of the transition to 2030 and beyond, including an estimation of overall economy-wide investment requirements. In parallel, the review of the National Development Plan is being completed to ensure that Exchequer capital investment aligns the acceleration in decarbonisation now required. </p>  <p>  Public investment over the next decade on climate action will be set out in the review of the NDP which is well underway.  The Programme for  Government also commits to the allocation of carbon tax revenues to climate action. The national Economic Recovery Plan and the Recovery and Resilience Plan published by Government on 1 June have climate and green investments as core pillars. In addition, the EU&rsquo;s &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU recovery package and &euro;1 trillion budget require that money can only be spent on projects that meet certain green criteria, with 30% of all funding to go on climate change mitigation. </p>  <p>  It is also the case that failure to rapidly make the investments to move to a carbon-neutral economic model will have far reaching negative impacts on the economy and the public finances; undermine the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy; and lock Ireland into a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model. Embracing the transition will support further job creation through the development of new and emerging sectors. The green economy, including the retrofitting and renewable energy sector, the circular economy, clean mobility, green and blue infrastructure, sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy will create high quality employment opportunities that will be a source of significant employment growth over the coming decades, as well as supporting a stable tax base.</p></reply>

Equally, it is a source for personal and family history. Irish Lights employed many generations around the coast of Ireland for over two centuries. The earliest records in the Archive date back to 1810.</p>  <p>  A major project began in 2019 to preserve and catalogue the Archive. The Archive contains over one thousand volumes and two thousand boxes of administrative records. The Archive project is prioritising records of greatest historical significance. In addition to routine preservation and cataloguing, a number of specialised conservation and digitisation projects are currently ongoing. This will allow the full potential of the Archive to be realised and will ultimately facilitate access to researchers, with a number of outreach projects planned.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question, the Commissioners of Irish Lights has confirmed it has pension records some of which date back to 1891. It is unclear at this point how comprehensive these records are. The records are currently closed to researchers as the Archive Project is ongoing but specific records can be made available at special request and subject to data protection requirements.</p></reply>

I recently launched the Alternatively-Fuelled Heavy Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme to assist commercial road transport operators and companies across the State to transition to alternative-fuelled vehicles. </p>  <p>  In furthering consideration of these matters, officials of my Department participate on an inter-departmental working group on hydrogen which considers all aspects of hydrogen including transport. My Department is also continuing to engage with industry-led hydrogen for transport initiatives, including possibilities to foster the development of an indigenous Irish market for hydrogen across the transport sectors.</p>  <p>  The European Union is this year engaging in a revision of the European Union&rsquo;s Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive. Subject to developments at a European level my Department is also keeping under review the future development of national alternative fuel transport networks, including hydrogen, that will support Ireland in reaching its ambitious 2030 decarbonisation targets and its goal of net zero carbon by 2050.</p></reply>

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.</p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  </p>  <p>  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. The NTA, following consultation with operators, has recently finalised a review of the scheme and as a result some changes to services are being implemented.</p>  <p>  Given the NTA's statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

However, the transfer of a property that is residential property during their lifetime, including a holiday rental cottage, to a son or daughter constitutes a conveyance on sale for the purposes of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999. Stamp duty is payable by the transferee, whether or not the property is transferred by way of sale or gift. Where a property is sold, or otherwise transferred, for less than market value, section 30 SDCA imposes a charge to stamp duty on the market value of the property.</p>  <p>  Stamp duty on transfers of residential property is usually chargeable at the rate of 1% where the consideration or market value does not exceed &euro;1 million. Where the consideration or market value exceeds &euro;1 million, stamp duty is chargeable at 1% on the first &euro;1 million and 2% on the amount that exceeds &euro;1 million. </p>  <p>In addition, the recent Financial Resolution passed by the D&aacute;il on 19 May last provides for a new higher stamp duty rate of 10% where at least 10 residential units (excluding apartments) are acquired by an individual or a corporate entity such as a company in any 12-month period, whether by way of gift or purchase. This new measure is &lsquo;triggered&rsquo; when a residential unit is acquired on or after 20 May 2021, with the &lsquo;look-back&rsquo; 12-month period commencing at this time on a rolling basis. The units acquired during that period are aggregated. When the 10th unit is acquired, it is chargeable at the 10% rate and this rate also then applies to the other 9 units and to any other units acquired at the same time as the 10th unit. However, while any units acquired before 20 May 2021 are taken into account in establishing whether the threshold of 10 units has been reached, the 10% rate of stamp duty is not applied to these units but only to those units acquired on or after this date. </p>  <p>  There are no stamp duty exemptions or reliefs in relation to transfers of residential property from a parent to a child.  </p></reply>

The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing its business premises.   A business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made. </p>  <p>  In order to make a claim under the scheme, a business must meet other eligibility criteria, including the requirement that the business would, but for the Covid restrictions, carry on the business activity and intends to carry on the activity when the Covid restrictions cease to be in operation. In circumstances where a business ceases to be subject to Covid restrictions which require it to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing its business premises, and the business chooses not to reopen, it will not qualify for payments under the CRSS.</p>  <p>  In addition, if during a period of Covid restrictions, a business that is significantly restricted from operating (and which would otherwise be eligible to claim under the CRSS) decides to cease trading, including in circumstances where the business owner ceases trading to pursue employment, the business concerned will no longer qualify for the CRSS.  This is because the business will no longer meet the requirement that it intends to carry on the business activity when the Covid restrictions cease to be in operation.  Any amounts claimed by a business that does not meet all the requirements to make a claim under the CRSS should be repaid to Revenue or will be recouped by Revenue through the relevant mechanisms contained in the CRSS legislation.</p>  <p>  There is no provision in the CRSS legislation to recoup monies received by a business for a claim period where, in that claim period, the business held a genuine intention to trade after the cessation of Covid restrictions and the business met all other eligibility criteria for making a claim under the CRSS.</p></reply>

These serve different, defined purposes with some having been in place for a number of years. I should also state that there are no plans to discontinue them at this time. These various levies and contributions are briefly detailed below.</p><p>The 2 per cent Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) levy is the only pure &quot;levy&quot; charged on insurance premiums. This is charged to fund the ICF which covers the cost of claims in this State where an insurer goes into liquidation. This levy was in place from 1984 to 1992 and was reintroduced in January 2012. It currently applies at a rate of 2 per cent of premiums received on all non-life insurance policies and its purpose is primarily to repay the Exchequer for funding the administration of Quinn Insurance. As there is still a significant amount owing to the State, the levy is likely to be applied for the remainder of this decade.</p><p>Separately, while there is not a 1 per cent insurance levy, the Deputy may be referring to the stamp duty charged on life insurance premiums, which is occasionally described as a levy. However, this is recorded to the Exchequer as a tax receipt jointly with a separate 3 per cent stamp duty charged on certain non-life premiums. As such it is not possible to differentiate both distinctly. Information on Stamp Duty yields, which includes these Life Assurance and Non-Life Insurance Levy components from 2010 onwards, can be found on the Revenue website statistics page: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/receipts/stamp-duty-receipts.pdf</i>. I am informed by Revenue that given the scope of the question, they are not in a position to provide the information in the time available. However, since 2010 the amount collected under these specific stamp duties is c.&euro;1.6 billion. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note the Motor Insurers Insolvency Compensation Fund (MIIC Fund) is a contribution equivalent to 2 per cent of gross motor premiums which is provided by motor insurers. This is not considered a levy as the decision rests with the insurance companies as to how this is financed i.e. either through absorbing it or passing it onto consumers. This ensures the compensation levels payable from the ICF for third party motor insurance claims as a result of a motor insurer insolvency is aligned with that where a motorist is in a collision with an unidentified or uninsured driver.</p><p>The contribution rate is subject to an annual review by me in my role as Minister of Finance. Currently, it is expected to continue for a number of years. </p></reply>

The scheme gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme. </p><p>In summary, the process for a first-time buyer to claim HTB involves two stages, application stage and claim stage. At the application stage, the claimant notifies Revenue of his/her intention to make a HTB claim and checks are carried out to ensure the applicant satisfies certain conditions of the scheme. Once confirmed, Revenue notifies the applicant about the potential HTB refund available. </p><p>An application for HTB will remain valid until one or more of the following occurs:</p><p>(a) if it is discovered that the individual did not satisfy a condition of HTB,</p><p>(b) an individual&rsquo;s tax clearance is rescinded, or</p><p>(c) 31 December (in the tax year in which the application is made).</p><p>In respect to point (c) above, for example where an application is made during the period 1 October to 31 December 2021, and a claim is made on foot of such an application in the period 1 January to 31 March 2022, the claim will be deemed to have been made in  2021.</p><p>With regard to the claim stage, Section 477C(3) TCA provides that a first time purchaser may make a claim for a HTB refund following the signing of a contract to purchase a home or, in the case of a self-build, following the drawdown of the first tranche of the relevant mortgage. </p><p>Revenue Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-46 outlines further guidance on the conditions and operation of the HTB scheme.</p><p>More generally, the future of the HTB scheme, beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2021, is a matter that will fall to be considered in the context of Budget 2022 and the subsequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

The goal of this regulatory framework will be to tackle the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through systemic oversight over how certain online services deliver and moderate the user-generated content on their platforms.</p>  <p>  These defined categories of harmful online content include content by which a person commits a criminal offence and a number of categories of potentially harmful content, these being:</p>  <p>  - Content by which a person engages in serious cyberbullying;</p>  <p>  - Content by which a person promotes suicide or self-harm, and,</p>  <p>  - Content by which a person promotes behaviour associated with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  These categories concerning potentially harmful content are carefully defined in the General Scheme to ensure that they deal with the most egregious content and respect other fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. These definitions are being refined during detailed legal drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  Provision is also made in the Bill for the addition of further categories of harmful online content in the future. This process will involve a proposal by the Media Commission, informed by stakeholder consultation, and both Government and Oireachtas approval. The Media Commission will be tasked with keeping a close eye on emerging online harms which may be suitable to be dealt with under the regulatory framework for online safety.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this provision is to future-proof the legislation to create a statutory process by which emerging online harms such as the issue raised by the Deputy may be examined for potential inclusion as a further category of harmful online content. This will help to avoid the need for ad-hoc primary legislation to deal with emerging harms in the future.</p>  <p>  It's intended that the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will be enacted this year. The Bill is on the Government priority list for publication during the current legislative session, which ends in July 2021. At the same time, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht is conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the Bill. The timeline for this is a matter for the Committee.</p></reply>

If upon review, a household is found to exceed the limits on income eligibility grounds, for example, they would be removed from the list.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, authorities are also required, when directed by the Minister, to undertake a statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) to count the number of households on the waiting list for social housing supports whose need has not yet been met. The SSHA process requires all local authorities to review those households who are on their housing list but who are not currently in receipt of housing support.</p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at assisting a group of homeowners that have no other practicable options to access redress for their home. </p>  <p>  The scheme outlines five remedial options ranging from rebuilding on existing foundations to replacing of external walls. The maximum approved costs per dwelling under the scheme are significant and range from &euro;55,000 to &euro;275,000 depending on the remedial option.  A grant of 90% of the approved costs associated with the necessary remediation works, subject to a maximum for each remedial option, or 90% of the actual cost of the remedial works, whichever is the lesser, is available under the scheme. This is in line with similar Government grant schemes where an applicant contribution to the costs is a requirement.  </p>  <p>  The scheme design was informed by the comprehensive work of an Expert Panel and the current maximum grant amounts payable under the various options in the scheme were finalised in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. This process was also informed by extensive engagement between my Department and both Donegal and Mayo County Councils. </p>  <p>  The scheme needs time to work and it is premature to consider making changes at this point. I am keeping progress under the scheme under review and engaging directly with both local authorities and local action groups on the matter. </p></reply>

From 1 August 2020, the blanket ban on rent increases inside or outside of a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) was lifted. Despite the lifting of the ban, the standardised average rent rose by just 2.5% to &euro;1,256 from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020 and remained at that level in Q4 2020. The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 (RTVA) provided that rent increases were not permitted to take effect during an emergency period, from 1 August 2020 until 10 January 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration.  This ban on rent increases was targeted at the most vulnerable of tenants inside and outside of RPZs. The Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (PDRTA) provides that a rent increase is not permitted to take effect during an emergency period from 11 January 2021 until 12 July 2021, for tenants with rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy who make the necessary declaration. This ban on rent increases is also targeted at the most vulnerable of tenants inside and outside of RPZs. The delimiting of landlords&rsquo; constitutionally protected property rights has been carefully and effectively targeted in this regard.</p>  <p>  Rent reviews could be carried out at all times during the pandemic and rent decreases could, and can, take effect. A rent increase is not payable by relevant tenants in respect of the emergency periods identified above. It is payable by relevant tenants from the end of the given emergency period.</p>  <p>  The maximum rent increase is 4% per annum in RPZs, irrespective of the emergency legislation. Where a landlord carries out a rent review for the first time in  2 years in an RPZ, a total increase of 8% can apply. Where a rent increase cannot be given effect for certain tenants during an emergency period, a total increase of greater than 4% can apply where the necessary rent review notice(s) have been served. In all cases, a tenant must be given 90 days&rsquo; notice before a rent increase takes effect.</p>  <p>  The targeted ban on rent increases under the PDRTA is due to expire on 12 July 2021. A further extension of the PDRTA protections is currently under consideration, to afford more time to the most vulnerable tenants to recover their financial stability. </p>  <p>  The emergency protections against rent increases and evictions for the most vulnerable tenants has meant that they could remain in their home and not face higher rent during the pandemic. The annual 4% rent increase restriction in RPZs is the maximum allowable increase and landlords are encouraged to consider their tenants&rsquo; situation in the context of any rent review.</p>  <p>  My Department, the Housing Agency and the RTB keep the operation of the rental market under review. Comprehensive rental legislation is planned for the Autumn, with provisions to help provide long term security of tenure for tenants at affordable rents.  </p></reply>

Under Article 17, mandatory contributions are apportioned based on a scale of assessment designed to reflect the capacity of Member States to pay.  </p>  <p>  At present, Ireland&rsquo;s scale of assessment is 0.371% of the overall UN Budget.  In 2020, Ireland paid just over &euro;30 million in contributions to the United Nations budget, this includes funding to the UN Regular Budget, UN Peacekeeping Missions and UN Tribunals. In 2010 the amount for these budget lines was just over &euro;43million.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs provides funding to the United Nations as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance programme, known as Irish Aid, each year.  The Department publishes an annual report on Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA). The report includes statistical information on programme expenditure in a series of annexes which lays out the distribution of aid, including the amounts given to United Nations organisations. It also includes ODA payments to the United Nations made by other Departments.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the annual report indicates that over &euro;152 million was provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs to United Nations organisations &ndash; a more detailed breakdown has been provided within the report annexes (see P.12). The published report for 2010 also provides information on funding allocations to United Nations organisations.</p>  <p>  With regard to figures for 2020, validation of data on Ireland&rsquo;s ODA programme is done in arrears, and prior to publication, draft statistical returns are shared with the relevant OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) experts for assurance that Ireland's reported spending meets the DAC's criteria to be counted as ODA.  This assurance is important to maintaining Ireland's reputation as a quality donor. Total figures and country level aggregates for 2020 are being finalised and will be published in the 2020 ODA Annual Report later this year.</p>  <p>  It has not been possible to access data for the year 2000 as it would necessitate attendance in the office, which has been restricted in line with Covid-19 protocols.</p></reply>

The delivery of Irish ODA follows international best practice approaches and is guided by principles for development effectiveness. A Better World, Ireland's international development policy, outlines the priorities of Ireland's development assistance programme.</p>  <p>  The Irish Aid programme is delivered through a number of different channels, including UN agencies, civil society organisations, and local Government partners. All of these partnerships are managed under agreements which outline the purpose of the funding and the management of the partnership and the results expected. These agreements are able to take account of the context, risk assessments, programme area and partner type.</p>  <p>  A portion of the funding provided to international partners is "core funding".

We are closely following the situation, including in relation to reports of systemic abuse, torture, arbitrary detention, forced labour, forced sterilisations, and restrictions on freedom of religion and belief. </p>  <p>  We raise our concerns with Chinese authorities in both bilateral and multilateral contexts. Most recently, I directly raised the matter during my meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on 30 May. </p>  <p>  Ireland also raised concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang in our National Statement at the UN Human Rights Council in March this year, and previously in our National Statement at the UN Human Rights Council in September last year, which urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also supported a number of joint initiatives in the UN system. We joined a Statement at the UN Third Committee on 6 October 2020 that reiterates our grave concern regarding the situation in Xinjiang, and recalls the exceptional letter of concern issued by 50 UN Special Procedures mandate holders. This letter called on China to respect human rights and to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers. </p>  <p>  In response to the situation, under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime (EUGHRSR), the EU adopted sanctions on 22 March 2021 against 1 entity and 4 individuals in China due to their involvement in human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The EUGHRSR allows the EU to target serious human rights violations and abuses by State and non-State actors worldwide. It enables the EU to respond rapidly and in a more tangible and direct way for human rights, one of the fundamental values of the EU and its foreign policy.</p>  <p>  Regarding the use of the term &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; in relation to this situation, this is a term which has a particular meaning under international law. The recognition of events definitively as genocide involves an analysis of both facts and law. Ireland follows the practice of recognising genocide where this has been established by a judgment of an international court, or where there is international consensus on the matter. </p>  <p>  An approach whereby the EU, its Member States and other like-minded States continue to press for better access to the region, particularly for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, to better establish the realities on the ground is more likely to achieve progress. This is an issue that Ireland and the EU takes extremely seriously and the Government will continue to monitor and assess the situation and engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora to address our concerns.</p></reply>

Our Consul General has met and engaged very regularly with the citizen, and continues to provide all possible consular advice and support. </p>  <p>  There has also been extensive and regular engagement at the most senior political and diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities in Beijing and Shanghai, and with the Embassy of China in Dublin, in relation to the humanitarian aspects of this case, and the importance of the citizen being allowed to return home as soon as possible.

In such cases the sending State shall recall the person concerned. Diplomats are rarely expelled and this provision is rarely used, but it provides a potential sanction, in particular in response to illicit activities by members of diplomatic Missions. The expulsion of an Ambassador, for reasons other than abuse of diplomatic functions or criminal behaviour, would likely lead to a reciprocal expulsion of the Irish Ambassador to the State concerned, and could potentially give rise to the breaking off of diplomatic relations.</p>  <p>  Our Embassies overseas are drivers of our bilateral relations, enabling us to maintain open lines of international communication, enabling  the conveyance of concerns directly to Governments, including in difficult circumstances. In Ireland, Ambassadors and other officials of Embassies frequently engage with officials from my Department on a wide range of issues.  I frequently meet with Ambassadors accredited to Ireland. Such exchanges are a key channel of communication between the Irish Government and foreign Governments.  </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the EDA means that we have access to research and information on developing and maintaining professional capabilities and research that we cannot self-generate.  This is important in terms of Ireland's ability to participate in UN mandated Peacekeeping Operations.  Also, Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the EDA affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.  </p>  <p>  The EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen) is an Agency working for the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union under the Political Supervision of the Political and Security Committee and the Operational Direction of the High Representative, which is governed by a Council Joint Action. In the international security and defence field, it handles sensitive and classified data to support CSDP military operations and civilian missions.  The Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs contribute to the budget of the EU SatCen.  Over the 14 years since 2007, the total contribution to the budget of the Sat Cen by the Department of Defence is &euro;1,180,701. </p>  <p>  In relation to the European Defence Fund (EDF) Member State contributions to the EU Budget (Own Resources) are currently calculated annually by the EU Commission in line with the provisions outlined in Own Resources Decision (ORD) Regulation (2014/335). This includes contributions through traditional own resources (primarily customs duties), a VAT-based contribution with a call rate of 0.3% of a notional harmonised rate, and a Gross National Income (GNI)-based contribution, calculated by taking a Member State&rsquo;s GNI as a share of EU27 GNI.  EU Budget revenue is general, and is not assigned to any particular fund. As such, the EDF does not have a defined cost to the Exchequer; rather, Ireland&rsquo;s contributions go into the general pool of revenue that funds all EU budget expenditure, including the EDF. The EDF is encompassed within the funding being provided for the Multiannual Financial Framework which is funded directly by the Exchequer.  As such, no charge arises for my Department's Vote as a result of the establishment of the EDF. It is important to note that participation in the EDF does not broker any consideration or obligation in respect of a common or mutual defence commitment or participation in a military defence alliance.  As such, participation in the EDF will not compromise Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. </p>  <p>  Separate to the EDA, EU SatCen and the EDF, Ireland also contributes to the funding of common costs for EU military crisis management operations. These costs are currently financed by the new European Peace Facility (EPF) which has replaced the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility. Both the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility were established in 2004 and operated until 2021.</p>  <p>  Under the EPF, the Department of Defence has responsibility for the financing of common costs relating to EU military operations under the EU's common security and defence policy (CSDP), previously handled by the Athena mechanism and the Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for the funding of African peace support operations, previously handled by the African Peace Facility. </p>  <p>  In addition, the EPF can extend financing for peace-support operations to partners other than the African Union and provide assistance to individual countries and regional or sub-regional organisations.</p>  <p>  In 2020, the European Council agreed a &euro;5bn financial ceiling for the EPF over the seven years of the 2021-2027 MFF. Actual spending of EPF funds will require separate unanimous Council Decisions for each operation or assistance measure and so the breakdown of spending over each of the seven years cannot therefore be predicted accurately at this time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-02a.306.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060200080#WRH03700"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the experience of past recessions indicates that youth employment tends to be significantly impacted by any labour market shock.  This is because many employers operate a "last in-first out" protocol when reducing their labour force.  Moreover, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact on our youth is driven by the tendency for many younger people to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic; namely accommodation and food and retail.</p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, seasonally adjusted youth unemployment (15-24 year olds) stood at just under 12% in December 2019.  Latest estimates from the CSO, however, show that by the end of April 2021, this figure had increased to almost 16.8%. These estimates exclude those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  Including all those in receipt of the PUP gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate 61.8% for young people at the end of April.</p>  <p>  A significant number of PUP recipients are students.  As of this week, it is estimated that approximately 38,000 PUP recipients are students, with almost 90 percent of these in the under 25 cohort. Using international measures of unemployment, set by the International Labour Organisation, students are generally not counted as unemployed, as they are not considered part of the labour force.  Therefore, the inclusion of recipients of PUP, including students, in the COVID-19 adjusted measure of youth unemployment inflates this measure. </p>  <p>  While the employment of young people has been significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that youth unemployment levels typically fall quite quickly once economic activity resumes.  In addition, the jobs of many persons currently on PUP will not be permanently lost due to the pandemic. Many have already and will continue to return to their previous employment as sectoral restrictions ease &ndash; as they did during previous easing of restrictions during 2020. </p>  <p>  However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs.  As a consequence, my Department supports a range of initiatives to assist people, including young people, get back to work, as COVID-19 restrictions and their impact on the economy and labour market eases.</p>  <p>  Under the Government&rsquo;s national Economic Recovery Plan launched this week, a central focus of the recovery process will be on helping people get back to work, training or education by extending labour market supports,  and through intense activation and skills opportunities. Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which is currently being finalised by my Department for launch later this month, will be a key delivery mechanism of the Economic Recovery Plan&rsquo;s second Pillar on &lsquo;Helping People Back into Work&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  This forthcoming strategy focusses on helping people back into employment, training and education, thereby minimising the long-term scarring effects of the pandemic on the labour force for those whose jobs are permanently lost. It has an overall target of increasing the caseload of the Public Employment Service by 100,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  Some of the key supports that will form part of the National Recovery Plan include:</p>  <p>  - A new Work Placement Experience Programme, to reach 10,000 participants by end-2022, for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age.</p>  <p>  - New Youth Employment Charter for intensive engagement with young jobseekers, building on the EU&rsquo;s new Reinforced Youth Guarantee. </p>  <p>  - Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years (with a 6 month duration of unemployment).</p>  <p>   - Accelerating rollout of an additional 50,000 education and training places (15,000 increase on the July Jobs Stimulus commitment) to support jobseekers to upskill and reskill for the labour market.</p>  <p>  With regard to apprenticeships, a significant recovery in apprenticeship registration numbers followed the introduction of the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme, which is continuing in 2021. In addition, the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, launched in April by my colleague Minister Harris, sets out a five-year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025.  The plan provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for employers and apprentices, which will prove attractive for many young people.</p>  <p>  Under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, the EU supported &euro;114 million SOLAS Recovery Skills Response Programme will see a range of additional educational and training programmes rolled out as part of the Skills to Compete. This includes the establishment of the SOLAS Green Skills Action programme focusing on providing training to address climate and low carbon economy issues. This will ensure workers, including young people, have the necessary skills to be resilient and competitive in our changing economy.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The scheme aimed to provide jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement. The scheme provided a supportive structure for participants, including case worker support for both placement hosts and jobseekers.</p><p>Since the scheme's inception, a total of 990 people have commenced a placement, with 50 jobseekers currently on YESS placements.  </p><p>The type of work experience undertaken by participants involved roles across a number of different sectors including - community and voluntary, hospitality and food, ICT and telecoms, manufacturing, retail, sales and marketing, science and healthcare and construction. Recruitment to the scheme in the scheme was severely affected by Covid-19 during 2020, with fewer hosts advertising vacancies due to temporary suspension of operations and social mobility and distancing requirements.  </p><p>While &euro;2.44m was allocated to the scheme for 2020, provisional estimates of expenditure show an outturn of &euro;1.7 million for the year.  The Budget allocation for the scheme this year is &euro;3.35m.</p><p>In the month of January 2020 there were 297 active participants on YESS with 59 closures and 46 new starts that month. By comparison, in January 2021 there were 131 active participants on YESS.</p><p>I intend to shortly launch a new work placement scheme to provide work experience for jobseekers who have been unemployed, including time spent on PUP, for more than six months regardless of age.  A particular objective is to provide a mechanism for those with recent work experience or with sector specific skills to pivot into new employment/jobs through additional learning with new and relevant work experience.</p><p>Existing YESS participants will be given the option to transfer onto the new programme prior to its launch, subject to the agreement of both the host and the participant.

An age- related Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance rate of &euro;112.70 generally applies to young jobseekers aged 18-24, to incentivise them to engage in education or training in order to improve their chances of obtaining full time sustainable employment. Where a young jobseeker participates in education or training they can receive the maximum weekly personal rate of &euro;203.  </p>  <p>  The best way of improving supports for young people is to focus on employment supports. Given the severity of the impact of the pandemic on youth unemployment one of my key priorities as restrictions are gradually lifted is to focus on getting young people back to work and assisting those young jobseekers who are looking to obtain their first job. </p>  <p>  Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, is committed to:</p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres, with the assignment of 100 job coaches to  provide enhanced employment services and supports; </p>  <p>  - Increasing the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people. Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person who is aged under 30, who has been unemployed for just 4 months; </p>  <p>  - Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education opportunities, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for  those currently unemployed;</p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of  &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited;     </p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was launched last month by my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  The Action Plan sets out a five-year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025.  The plan provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for employers and apprentices, which will prove attractive for many young people.</p>  <p>  My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age. This programme will seek to encourage businesses to provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job.&rdquo; The programme aims to incentivise the participation of young people through an attractive weekly uplift to their weekly payment entitlement. It is anticipated that those currently on the Youth Employment Support Scheme will be permitted to transfer across to the new programme providing the participant and host are both agreeable. I expect to bring the Programme to government shortly for consideration and anticipate a launch of the programme shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which is currently being finalised by my Department will set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market.  This whole-of-Government strategy will seek to build upon those support measures outlined above particularly for young jobseekers.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-02a.392.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060200082#WRK00400"><p>My Department provides a suite of income supports for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability. It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness/disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.</p>  <p>  In March of last year, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period. The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected. This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment. It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.</p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility. Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type. Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit. The Department may also make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.</p>  <p>  Given the comprehensive set of supports available to people who are unable to work due to illness, I do not propose to extend the duration of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment at this time.</p>  <p>I trust this clarifies the issue.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-02a.395.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021060200082#WRK00700"><p>There are a number of payments and pensions paid by the Department to people over State pension age.  One of these is the State pension (contributory), qualification for which is based on a number of criteria, including that a minimum of 520 qualifying social insurance  contributions have been paid.  People who have not made such contributions are generally paid alternative payments.  It should be noted having 520 paid contributions alone does not qualify a person for a maximum rate pension.  Comprehensive details on qualification criteria are available on the Department's website at https://www.gov.ie/en/service/e6f908-state-pension-contributory/ </p><p>Once fulfilment of those conditions is achieved, there are a number of additional payments that may be available to recipients in certain circumstances.One such payment is the increase for qualified adult which is payable once the financially dependent adult satisfies a means test.  It is normally paid where the qualified adult does not have enough contributions to claim a pension in their own right and it is usually paid on the basis of the contribution history of the primary pension recipient.  Comprehensive details on this increase are also available on the Department's website at <i>www.gov.ie/en/service/a2ae6f-increase-for-a-qualified-adult/</i>.</p><p>In an effort to improve the position of the Qualified Adults of pensioners in receipt of the State pension, changes were made over time to allow for it to be paid directly to the Qualified Adult.  The stated rationale for this at the time was to transform the payment into what is in effect a payment that would be paid directly to the Qualified Adult in their own right as distinct for being a dependant of their spouse.  </p><p>An increase for qualified adult is also payable on non-contributory State pension where the qualified adult is under 66 years of age and satisfies a means test.The means test for State pension non-contributory takes into account the income and assets of both the claimant and his or her spouse or partner.  Capital, property (excluding a person's home), savings and investments are assessed as capital and a formula is then used to assess the weekly means from capital.The weekly rate payable depends on the total weekly means of the person or couple.</p><p>State pension (non-contributory) differs fundamentally from contributory payments in its design. It is intended to support people in Ireland who have an income need, and to ensure they do not experience poverty in their old age, even if they did not pay significant PRSI while working or make other private provision for retirement.  State pension (contributory) by contrast is an entitlement built up through PRSI contributions, and is not impacted upon by the means of the pensioner, nor their residence. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The youth sector is identified in the text as a key pillar in promoting young people&rsquo;s access to rights.</p>  <p>  My Department provides substantial funding to a range of national and local youth services that provide support to young people in areas relevant to this Recommendation, including through developing their active citizenship and autonomy, providing access to information and to opportunities for mobility, and enhancing their employability. Special attention is paid through my Department&rsquo;s targeted funding scheme to young people with fewer opportunities, including those from disadvantaged or marginalised communities.</p>  <p>  Another key component of my Department&rsquo;s role in enhancing young people&rsquo;s access to rights is through the implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-Making, which ensures that policy and service provision at all levels reflect the views of young people.

The Scheme is intended to support the operation of volunteer-led youth projects. In 2019, &euro;1.9 million in funding was made available under the LYCGS, and 1,312 youth clubs or groups availed of this funding. Some 78,960 young people nationwide benefited from LYCGS funding in 2019. The grants were made available to the youth clubs and groups through their local Education and Training Boards (ETBs).</p>  <p>  My Department allocates almost &euro;67 million to support the provision of youth services nationwide. This funding has been maintained throughout the recent challenging period and this has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people. In recent years, funding for the provision of youth services has increased on an annual basis. Between 2016 and 2020 the annual current youth funding available to my Department increased from &euro;51.9m to &euro;61.79. Additionally, last year I secured a &euro;5 million increase in funding for youth services, including an increase of 7% for the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme.</p></reply>

The newly established resident welfare team in IPAS will also work to assess any additional needs the person may have in the context of their accommodation.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware a new Vulnerability Assessment process is currently being piloted by IPAS. The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for international protection from the beginning of February. This assessment provides an opportunity for members of the LGBTI+ community to disclose information at an early stage, helping to ensure appropriate accommodation and support is provided without delay.</p>  <p>  As vulnerabilities can manifest themselves at any stage of the protection process, applicants will also be able to undergo a Vulnerability Assessment at a later stage if this is desired by the applicant and deemed necessary by IPAS or other reception service providers. This is to help to ensure that any vulnerabilities that may subsequently arise are identified in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  IPAS also liaises with State and NGO support agencies to assist our residents who may need guidance or support. In this regard, LGBT Ireland work with residents in our centres who identify as LGBTI+.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, LGBT Ireland has facilitated a peer support group for LGBTI+ people in the International Protection process. Currently 'Is Rainbow Muid' meet online twice a month and continues to provide vital supports to members of the LGBTI+ community living in our accommodation centres at this time.</p>  <p>  In addition, a confidential Freephone telephone support service, funded by, but independent of, my Department, was established in May 2020 to provide further support to residents who are being accommodated by my Department. This Freephone confidential support helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS).</p>  <p>  IPAS has commenced a review of a number of its operational policies currently in place for the IPAS accommodation network. As part of this review, a specific policy with regard to the provision of accommodation services for LGBTI+ protection applicants will be prepared in consultation with the Department's Equality Unit and relevant LGBTI+ support groups.</p></reply>

While it is appreciated that the COVID impacts are disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures are necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous institutions as provided for in legislation and are responsible for their own academic affairs. Therefore, the determination of the total level of tuition fees is a matter for each institution in accordance with its own particular operational conditions and circumstances in ensuring quality education provision.</p>  <p>  In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. Students are encouraged to engage with their institution to discuss any issues in relation to their course, including course delivery and fees.</p>  <p>  In considering fees, it is important to note that the State currently provides very substantial financial support to undergraduate students in higher education towards the cost of their studies. This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level.</p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education.  </p>  <p>  All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution. In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees at a cost of over &euro;180m.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 20/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state.</p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant received a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state could reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  This builds on the additional supports announced in July 2020 including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education and an additional &euro;3m provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives.</p>  <p>  Students experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Office of the institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

This will be extended to all apprenticeship with over 80% participation of any gender to support gender diversity.<br /><br />- An apprentice bursary/support scheme will be established to fund up to 100 apprentices per year who are experiencing severe socioeconomic disadvantage and who are from target groups, including lone parents, people with disabilities, Travellers and Roma. <br /><br />- Access to apprenticeship programmes and pre-apprenticeship courses will be clearly labelled as such, with progression routes into apprenticeship clearly identified and information on these courses will be published on www. apprenticeship.ie. <br /><br />- An employer survey will determine baseline employer attitude and extent of knowledge of supports available to employers for supporting employees with a disability. </blockquote>  <p>The actions set out in the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 build on the outcomes of the 2018 Review of Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship which has already resulted in a significant widening of measures to support increased visibility of apprenticeships. In April 2021, there were a total of 1,113 women apprentices, up from 60 in 2016.</p></reply>

GSOC is the sole body in the State charged with investigating concerns about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   </p>  <p>  The position is that there is no specific body that reviews the outcomes of GSOC investigations. GSOC have customer service procedures in place to receive complaints about their service from members of the public, and any member of the public who has concerns about the service they have received from GSOC, or the conduct of a member of GSOC's staff, is encouraged to engage with this process. Neither I nor my Department can intervene in any individual complaint about GSOC made in this way, nor can I comment on any aspect of this process, as GSOC are independent in these matters.</p>  <p>  It is of course open to any citizen who is dissatisfied with the decision of a public body to seek redress through the Courts.</p>  <p>  There is also, as the Deputy may be aware, a mechanism for an independent inquiry into the conduct of designated officers of GSOC.  Section 109 of the Act permits the Minister, having consulted with GSOC, to invite the Chief Justice to nominate a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court to inquire into the conduct of a designated officer of GSOC while performing functions under section 98 or 99 in relation to an investigation.  Given the nature of such an inquiry, one which is carried out by a judge of the superior courts it can not be considered to be an ordinary complaints or grievance procedure.  Furthermore, it is important to emphasise that the purpose of such an inquiry is to inquire into the conduct of a designated officer either on a particular occasion or in general in performing functions under the relevant sections. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that the general scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, recently approved for drafting by the Government, includes provision for a right of review to GSOC in relation to decisions that bring a complaints process to a conclusion, in the context of an overall new approach to investigating complaints.  </p></reply>

Section 10(4) further relates to travelling outside of the jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  The forthcoming Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill will, among other things, strengthen and tighten the notification requirements for convicted sex offenders. The Bill will reduce the notification period from seven to three days. </p>  <p>  When Garda authorities become aware that a convicted sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, personnel attached to the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU), Garda National Protective Services Bureau, ensures that the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is advised. This is generally conducted via Interpol. </p>  <p>  An Information Sharing Agreement exists between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), supported by a Memorandum of Understanding, which allows the sharing of information directly between the SOMIU and the Public Protection Intelligence Unit, PSNI, regarding convicted sex offenders who cross over the border between both jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  When the SOMIU receives such a notification, the information is formally recorded and the relevant nominated Divisional Inspector, with responsibility for the monitoring of sex offenders, is notified to ensure monitoring of the offender, and where relevant, ensure the offender is visited to confirm they understand their requirements under Part II of the Act of 2001.  </p>  <p>  In urgent cases, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have attended at ports of entry into the State to advise travelling sex offenders of their obligations under the Act.</p>  <p>  There are cases however, where persons with convictions abroad enter this jurisdiction and nonotification is brought to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Typically these type of cases occur where no sex offender legislation exists in the offender&rsquo;s home country or where the offender leaves their home jurisdiction without notifying law enforcement authorities. </p></reply>

The intention of the programme is to divert children and young people who have engaged in criminal or anti-social behaviour away from the criminal justice system and towards more positive life choices. Children who commit criminal offences are considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme, as provided in the Children Act 2001. Each such case is assessed and the Director of the Garda Diversion Programme (a Garda Superintendent) decides if the case is suitable or not for inclusion. </p><p>The operation of the programme includes informal and formal Garda warnings, delivered in the presence of parents or guardians, as well as provision for supervision by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer. The scope of the Diversion programme is illustrated by 2019 figures, which show that 18,567 children were referred for consideration under the programme.</p><p>Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) are a fundamental support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme and provide a vital ingredient in enhancing community policing partnerships. There are currently 105 Projects nationwide. These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives, which are funded directly by my Department. GYDPs seek to divert young people who have become involved, or are at risk of becoming involved, in crime/anti-social behaviour away from future involvement with the criminal justice system. They are primarily targeted at 12-17 year old young people in communities where a specific need for the service has been identified. On average, the Garda Youth Diversion Projects engage with between 3,500 and 4,000 young people across the state in any one year. </p><p>While the projects primarily receive referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they may receive referrals from other sources including schools, parents or self-referrals, including in some cases working with young people who are not under Garda supervision, or have been deemed unsuitable for diversion. Individual GYDPs also undertake early intervention preventative work and support for families. Therefore, as projects include a mixture of young people referred from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other sources, data on GYDPs participants is not directly comparable with data on those considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme.</p><p>The following links to the Annual Reports of the Committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Diversion programme for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 may be of assistance to the Deputy. The statistics provided in these reports contain information on referrals to the Diversion Programme, which corresponds to the numbers of crime incidents considered. </p><p>2017 - <i>www.iyjs.ie/en/iyjs/pages/publications</i>.</p><p>2018 - <i>www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Annual_Report_of_the_Committee_Appointed_to_Monitor_the_Effectiveness_of_the_Diversion_Programme_2018.pdf/Files/Annual_Report_of_the_Committee_Appointed_to_Monitor_the_Effectiveness_of_the_Diversion_Programme_2018.pdf</i>.</p><p>2019 - <i>www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Annual_Report_of_the_Committee_Appointed_to_Monitor_the_Effectiveness_of_the_Diversion_Programme_2019.pdf/Files/Annual_Report_of_the_Committee_Appointed_to_Monitor_the_Effectiveness_of_the_Diversion_Programme_2019.pdf</i>.</p></reply>

Preventing children getting involved in criminality and diverting children away from it when they have already become involved is one of the priorities for me as Minister for State in the Department of Justice.  Both the Programme for Government and the Justice Plan 2021 contain a number of commitments with regard to tackling crime. </p><p>The Garda Diversion Programme, strictly speaking, does not include the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs). The Diversion Programme is the work that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do to assess cases, give cautions and provide supervision in the community. These activities are all part of the Budgetary Vote for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>The Garda Diversion Programme is supported by a network of 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) nationwide.  GYDPs are community-based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives, which seek to divert young people from crime/anti-social behaviour and to support wider preventative work within the community and with families at risk. They are primarily targeted at 12-17 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified. The work of the GYDPs will be strengthened over the coming years in line with the recently published Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027.</p><p>Garda Youth Diversion Projects are funded from both Exchequer and Dormant Accounts funding, with around half of the funding typically being recouped from the European Social Fund. </p><p>Details of the funding allocation provided for Garda youth diversion projects in 2007 is not available, however funding  for GYPDs from 2008 to date in 2021 is laid out in the table below. These costs relate to salary payments, general overheads and other expenses.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Funding Allocated</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2007</td>       <td>-</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2008</td>       <td>&euro;9.3m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2009</td>       <td>&euro;11.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010</td>       <td>&euro;10.8m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>&euro;11.5m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>&euro;11.2m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>&euro;11.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>&euro;11.5m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>&euro;13.1m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;12.9m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;13.4m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;13.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;15.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;16.8m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>&euro;17.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>&euro;180.50m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Under the European Social Fund 2014-2020 Operating Programme,  we have recouped &euro;31.9m in funding to date in this cycle.

This Bill will improve the performance and accountability of our policing and security services, and support the human rights of all people throughout Ireland to be and feel safe in their communities. It will represent the most wide ranging and coherent reform of policing in a generation.</p>  <p>  The Bill has four main objectives: </p>  <p>1.  Make the prevention of harm and protection of people who are vulnerable or at risk, and the safety of communities, a &ldquo;whole of government&rdquo; responsibility, </p>  <p>2.  Strengthen and consolidate independent, external oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,</p>  <p>3.  Enhance the internal governance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the role of the Garda Commissioner as CEO, and </p>  <p>4.  Improve the independent oversight of our national security infrastructure.</p>  <p>  This Bill has been developed on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland following its fundamental in-depth review and builds on the work of the policing oversight bodies.</p>  <p>  The commission found that community safety requires a whole of Government approach in partnership with local communities. My Department has been developing a new Community Safety Policy and this new policy will be given a statutory basis in the Bill. The Bill proposes the establishment of Local Community Safety Partnerships at local authority level, bringing together a range of service providers and community members to develop a local community safety plan. To support and inform the policy, three Local Community Safety Partnerships are being piloted in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, Waterford and Longford and will run for the next two years.  </p>  <p>  The pilots will inform the development of the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area as part of the provisions of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. </p>  <p>  As the Pilots are still being established, it is not possible to provide a definitive membership, and the membership of each local Partnership may vary; however it is intended that local drugs and alcohol task forces will be included in the membership where appropriate. It is anticipated that the drugs and alcohol task forces are likely to be relevant to many local communities and appropriate for membership. The Local Authorities, HSE, Garda&iacute;, schools and youth organisations, Government Departments and State services, as well as community groups and interested citizens will form the membership of the Partnerships.</p></reply>

The Irish Deer Management Forum was established to implement the various actions listed in the Report. </p>  <p>  The Department and the NPWS as joint contracting authorities signed a three-year contract with the Wicklow Uplands Council in August 2018 for deer management services in the Co. Wicklow region. The overall objective of this pilot project is to test good practice in deer management in the Wicklow region, with a long-term aim that project results could be replicated in other regions in the State.  </p>  <p>  Several Deer Management Units have been established as part of this contract. These units are in charge of implementing agreed deer management plans in accordance with approved standards in their respective areas. The contractors are collecting data and establish baseline data on damage levels caused by deer as part of the project&rsquo;s workplan.</p>  <p>  The Department also introduced a Deer Fencing and Tree Shelter Scheme to protect forests from predation by deer in 2018 as deer can cause serious damage to trees, particularly in native woodlands. </p></reply>

SICAP also provided supports to children and families to support education and personal development and to prevent early school leaving. The below table provides further information. <table>    <tr>       <th>Beneficiary</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Local Community Groups (Goal 1) with disadvantaged young people as the primary target group</td>       <td>121(5% of total Goal 1 caseload)</td>       <td>117(4% of total Goal 1 caseload)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Individuals (Goal 2) aged 15-24 years</td>       <td>5,440(18% of total Goal 2 caseload)</td>       <td>4,479(17% of total Goal 2 caseload)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Children participating in Children &amp;amp; Families activities</td>       <td>35,249</td>       <td>30,057</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Under SICAP, funding is provided Local Development Companies to allow them to carry out work locally to help disadvantaged individuals and the groups that represent those individuals.

However, the allocations were not further subdivided by age category.  Instead the Local Development Company and the LCDC in each area are given the flexibility to carry out work as needed in their area.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Total Annual Amount</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;38,027,601</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;39,168,430</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>&euro;39,168,430</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>
