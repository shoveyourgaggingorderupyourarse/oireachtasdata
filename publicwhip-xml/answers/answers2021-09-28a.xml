Currently foreshore licence applications are being considered for site investigations to assist with site selection and for gathering environmental and technical data to inform the future location and detailed design of proposed offshore wind farms. </p><p>Energia currently have two applications for foreshore licences for site investigations on the South East coast.  Licences have recently been granted following the assessment of these applications and the relevant notices of determination will be published shortly, as required under section 21 of the Foreshore Act 1933. Details of these applications can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>There are also a number of pre-applications covering the same area of coastline that are currently undergoing technical review in my Department prior to being put forward to full application and public consultation stage of the assessment process for a foreshore licence.</p><p>An Investigative Foreshore Licence does not grant exclusivity to a developer on the area licensed. A licence holder may only carry out the works as specified in the licence and such a licence does not permit the development of an offshore wind farm. Such developments will be the subject of future applications under a new consenting regime which is due to be introduced under the Maritime Area Planning Bill.  <b></b></p></reply>

Vacant Homes Officers, already in situ in each Local Authority, will be responsible for driving this programme forward. </p><p>I encourage Local Authorities to be proactive in utilising their legislative powers for compulsory purchase, where necessary, with the aim of bringing the greatest number of recoverable long-term vacant dwellings and sites back into use. In many cases, however, the use of compulsory purchase powers is not necessary, as agreement to purchase can be reached between the local authority and the property owner. </p></reply>

In fact, I understand that on 27 August last, Minister O&rsquo;Brien visited the village of Broadford in Clare and spoke to residents on this very issue. He has also met with Oireachtas members from the constituency to discuss the matter on numerous occasions and he is fully committed to finding a suitable solution for the people of Broadford. </p>  <p>  My Department builds its strategic water policy and infrastructure delivery programmes around the National Planning Framework 2018-2040 and the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  Investment is primarily delivered through Irish Water while my Department operates the Rural Water Programme directly. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government supports the uptake of Irish Water's Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, which will provide water and waste water growth capacity in smaller settlements that would otherwise not be provided for in Irish Water's capital investment plan. </p>  <p>  Complementary to Irish Water&rsquo;s Programme, my Department is currently examining waste water requirements in the context of villages and settlements that do not have public waste water infrastructure. As mentioned, Minister O&rsquo;Brien has instructed the relevant officials in the  Department to prepare a report on this topic at national level. This report will include the analysis of a baseline survey of all rural local authorities to quantify and qualify the number of villages and settlements concerned. This process is at an advanced stage, and Minister O'Brien will be in a position to consider the matter further in relation to these villages and similar settlements, as identified in the survey, once he has received the final report.</p></reply>

Therefore, I cannot comment on any specific decisions concerning An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  On the generalities of the Board performing its functions, when making a decision, the Board in accordance with Section 143 of the Act, shall have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government, a State authority, the Minister, planning authorities and any other body which is a public authority whose functions have, or may have, a bearing on the proper planning and sustainable development of cities, towns or other areas, whether urban or rural. This includes guidance issued by my Department regarding student accommodation. </p>  <p>  In the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, student accommodation was defined as SHD for developments of more than 200 units.  As of end August 2021, the Board had received SHD applications in respect of 15,684 student bed spaces. 13,660 student bedspaces have been granted planning permission to that date.</p>  <p>My Department issued Circular PL 8 of 2016 regarding the identification of planning measures to enhance housing supply. This included the consideration of the student accommodation to help ease the housing crisis. My colleague the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has contacted my Department concerning the recent issues regarding student accommodation.  An updated circular has issued indicating that in considering planning applications for the change of use of student accommodation for a temporary period, planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must be satisfied that there are compelling non-Covid related grounds to grant permission for any such proposed change of use, while demand for student accommodation remains high.    </p></reply>

On 31 May and 2 June and, most recently again, on 13 and 14 September, I met with the Chief Executives of all local authorities including both Galway City and County Councils, where a range of issues relating to the Housing for All plan were discussed, including resources and infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Housing for All contains strong commitments on strengthening the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects. These commitments arise from engagements I have had with all our local authorities - both officials and elected members - including with Galway colleagues, which have directly influenced the new plan.</p>  <p>  Supports are being provided to all local authorities through the Housing Delivery Co-Ordination Office (HDCO), which has been established within the Local Government Management Agency. </p>  <p>  Housing for All commits to further build focussed housing delivery teams within the local authorities that are equipped to deliver on the scale of ambition in the Plan.  It commits that before the end of 2021, we will complete a structured review of the resources, skillsets and training required to ensure that all necessary resources are in place to design, deliver and implement social housing projects, in line with the needs outlined in this Plan. Work is well advanced in this area. The HDCO has met directly with all local authorities including those in Galway, in carrying out an analysis of the additional skillsets and resources required, including project management skillsets. </p>  <p>  Housing for All also recognises that housing cannot be delivered unless we have strong integration between housing developments and the surrounding infrastructure and the move to plan-led development will support this integrated system.</p></reply>

The Local Authority Home Loan will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate for new borrowers by 0.25% under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL), as from 10 September 2021; this lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.</p>  <p>I also announced a &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle for applications to State affordable housing and loan schemes. This means that people who are divorced or separated and have no interest in the family home, or who have undergone insolvency proceedings, will be eligible to apply.   </p></reply>

Therefore, on 9 September 2021, new provisions were commenced to allow for applications, subject to certain conditions, for further extensions of duration of planning permission of 2 years or until 31 December 2023, which ever first occurs, under section 42(1B) of the Planning and Development Act 2000. This further extension period takes into account the restrictions on construction and disruptions in logistics, supply chains, and the availability of personnel when restarting construction work after the closure of building sites over the last year. Accordingly, I have no plans to provide for further legislation for extensions to planning permissions for residential housing.</p>  <p>  An estimate of the number of planning permissions for residential housing delayed by Covid-19 and by building supply issues due to expire without completion in 2021 is not available in my Department. It is a matter for the relevant planning authority, in respect of any permission due to expire without completion in 2021, to determine on a case by case basis whether the conditions for granting a further extension of the period are satisfied.</p></reply>

This is intended to build on the existing higher-rate stamp duty measures and restrictions on planning permissions introduced in May 2021 by way of section 28 Guidelines on the Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing.</p>  <p>  The current guidelines ensure that new &lsquo;own-door&rsquo; houses and duplex units in housing developments are not bulk-purchased by commercial institutional investors in a manner that causes the displacement of individual purchasers and/or social and affordable housing including cost-rental. The guidelines set out two alternative planning conditions to which planning authorities must have regard, in granting planning permission for new residential development that includes 5 or more houses and/or duplex units. </p>  <p>  The conditions restrict such properties to first occupation and use by individual purchasers and those eligible for social/affordable housing including cost-rental. To achieve this, the applicant must enter into an agreement with the planning authority, which may be terminated in certain circumstances.</p>  <p>  Action 1.10 seeks to allow local authorities, following on from the preparation of Housing Need and Demand Assessments, to specify a proportion of houses and duplexes in a development for individual purchasers. It is not proposed to restrict this measure to first time buyers, however it may assist such individual purchasers. It is proposed to bring proposals forward in Q4 2021 in this regard.</p></reply>

Reducing construction costs is critical to increasing supply. Recent analysis by industry indicates that construction build costs account for approximately 47% of total apartment development costs. </p>  <p>  Prices for a large number of construction materials have increased significantly over the last 12-18 months. The CSO Wholesale Price Index shows the annual increase for building and construction materials to be 9.9% to the end of July 2021.</p>  <p>  Construction material supply issues are also being experienced in other markets. These issues appear to result from a range of factors including Brexit, the disruption caused by Covid 19 and increased global demand.</p>  <p>  Reducing residential construction costs is a key theme within Housing for All, with actions centred on analysis, innovation, research and productivity through a whole-of-government approach in collaboration with Industry. These structures and actions include:</p>  <p>  The new Construction Technology Centre under development by Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment will prioritise residential construction - supporting innovation, modern methods of construction and digitalisation.</p>  <p>  The Construction Sector Group led by Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will implement a pipeline of cost reducing innovations and productivity measures for the residential construction sector. This group will also carry out an analysis of costs with a view to reducing these costs and increasing standardisation. </p>  <p>  The role of enterprise agencies will be expanded to include the provision of funding and supports for innovation and productivity-related projects in the domestic residential construction sector.</p>  <p>  The public sector will continue to provide projects to help with the capacity building process through public tenders for innovations such as rapid delivery housing.</p>  <p>Whilst recognising that the cost of construction materials is subject to external influences, Housing for All commits the State to playing a more central role in leading and funding these structures with a view to reducing the costs of construction in collaboration with the construction sector.  </p></reply>

On 31 May and 2 June and, most recently again, on 13 and 14 September, I met with the Chief Executives of all local authorities including both Galway City and County Councils, where a range of issues relating to the Housing for All plan were discussed, including land, funding and resources.</p>  <p>  Housing for All contains strong commitments on strengthening the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects. Supports are being provided to all local authorities through the Housing Delivery Co-Ordination Office (HDCO), which has been established within the Local Government Management Agency.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is also supporting local authorities in the area of land acquisition through an early payment arrangement for suitable sites.  I hope that both Galway local authorities will be utilising this opportunity to add to their land holdings and take advantage of early payment arrangements.  My Department is also working with the Galway local authorities and others to develop housing proposals where possible to utilise sites that carry debt for the authorities.  </p>  <p>  Galway City Council has availed of the Land Aggregation Scheme (LAGS) which assists in the gradual unwinding of Housing Finance Agency (HFA) loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme. Under the Scheme, local authorities could for a nominal fee, transfer residential development land on which there were outstanding HFA loans to the Housing Agency. The Galway City Council site at Ballymoneen Road, Ballyburke was redeemed under LAGS in full at a cost of &euro;7m.</p>  <p>  In terms of the delivery of affordable housing schemes, Housing for All delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system. It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum and will see 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes built, alongside 90,000 social homes. </p>  <p>  Specifically regarding middle-income families wishing to buy homes, the Housing for All strategy contains a multi-pronged approach to improving affordability.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.   </p>  <p>  In terms of delivery of affordable housing interventions by local authorities, my Department together with the Housing Agency has met with the Galway local authorities regarding structures for the procurement and delivery of affordable housing.  Local authorities intending to advance an affordable purchase scheme can apply to my Department for Exchequer funding of up to &euro;100,000 per unit under the Affordable Housing Fund. It is anticipated that in most cases nationally, affordable homes will be delivered via partnership arrangements between local authorities and contractors whereby the majority of development funding is provided by the contracted body.  Direct sales agreements will provide for the sale of homes directly from the contracted party to the eligible purchaser referred by the local authority.  In this way the financial risk for the local authority is minimised.  </p>  <p>  In addition to these distinct shared equity schemes, Housing for All also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes.</p>  <p>  Further to the above, Housing for All also provides the following supports -</p>  <p>  - increased funding provided to the Land Development Agency,</p>  <p>  - the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative intended to service sites and refurbish existing vacant properties in regional towns and villages,</p>  <p>  - a higher stamp duty rate for institutional investors that purchase family homes,</p>  <p>  - increased regulation of short-term letting properties,</p>  <p>  - additional measures to reduce vacancy rates, and</p>  <p>  - expanded supports for retrofitting existing homes.</p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home.</p></reply>

This analysis concluded that cost levels within each of the schemes funded under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme, which includes long term leasing, were generally below average rent price levels in the market, and as such, each of the schemes were meeting their individual operating objectives, and reducing the price impact on the market.</p>  <p>  Building on the 2017 review, IGEES carried out a further analysis, published in July 2018, focusing on the comparative analysis of delivery streams particularly related to cost effectiveness. This report found that in certain areas, where house prices are higher - e.g. Dublin and Meath - the net present cost (NPC) of delivering units via current funding programmes such as leasing is higher than construction or acquisition.  In areas where house prices are lower &ndash; e.g. Mayo and Tipperary - the NPC of leasing and other current funding programmes is either at or below that for construction and acquisition. </p>  <p>  Whilst the 2018 report found that relative cost efficiency is an important consideration in terms of the mix of delivery, it also found that it is not the only consideration and must be viewed in the context of policy objectives and wider issues. In this context, as well as relative costs, a number of other considerations must be taken into account in terms of the overall mix of delivery including the speed of delivery, the quality and appropriateness of accommodation, sectoral capacity and flexibility. </p>  <p>  Looking at the most recent cost information available, the average cost for a leased unit, based on leased units claimed for the first half of 2021, is &euro;11,904 per housing unit. </p>  <p>  Finally, a full spending review of the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), which includes long term leasing, is currently being undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></reply>

A key objective is that everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life. </p>  <p>  Aligned with our overall National Planning Framework (NPF) objective for compact growth, vibrant, liveable cities and towns must offer options for both owner occupiers and renters, at all income levels.  The new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund as outlined in Housing for All, is intended to ensure that aligned with the objectives of the NPF, additional choices are made available to home buyers in our urban cores, and town centres.  It will do this by working to extend home ownership options, where the choice is currently limited:</p>  <p>  - In urban areas, for apartment living in developments over a certain height/density threshold;</p>  <p>  - In towns, where options for building new private dwellings have been constrained by the lack of serviced sites. </p>  <p>  In higher density locations, the number of apartments being built for sale poses a challenge.  We are also aware of a high level of unactivated permissions, particularly for apartments, in our urban areas.  A Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) fund is being established, which through a competitive bid process, will seek to deliver developments at a viable cost for sale to owner occupiers, targeted principally at  activating the planning permissions already in place for such homes over the coming five years.  It will be managed by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  Different challenges arise for facilitating owner-occupation in towns, where viable sites available for building of new homes are in short supply. There is significant potential for local authorities to support homeownership in these areas by making available serviced sites at a reduced cost or providing support towards the refurbishment of vacant properties where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high.  A pathfinder programme will be initiated as part of a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) fund, to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Housing Agency to develop an operational basis for this new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund, which will work alongside other related funds such as the Affordable Housing Fund and complement measures forthcoming in the Towns Centre First (TCF) policy framework, details of which are expected to be finalised over Q4 2021.</p></reply>

At that time, the National Policy on Architecture report had been circulated to all Government Departments and relevant bodies. The observations received in response were constructive and are being incorporated into the draft policy text. </p>  <p>  The Deputy has acknowledged the fast-evolving policy environment at national and European levels. Up-to-date built environment policy priorities and strategies have been cross-referenced in the consultation report.

This information may be available from individual local authorities. </p>  <p>  Specific funding, to tackle dereliction in major towns and cities, may be made available through the integrated projects being supported by the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) which was launched in 2018.  This fund is targeting financial support in an integrated, dynamic and responsive way to support the regeneration and rejuvenation of our towns and cities.  Already, the URDF is providing assistance for major projects that will contribute to meeting the objectives of the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan.

The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.  </p>  <p>  In addition, where a victim of domestic violence applies for social housing support in their own right while still a joint tenant, it is a matter for the relevant local authority to address the contractual issues arising in relation to the joint tenancy agreement. Accordingly, the household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.</p>  <p>  The guidance was introduced with the objective of supporting a partnership approach by statutory agencies in respect of the delivery of domestic violence services, particularly in relation to helping to prevent and reduce the occurrence of related homelessness and facilitating the provision of long term accommodation for victims of domestic violence. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above supports, it should be noted that a new protocol was established in 2020 between the Department of Social Protection and Tusla whereby a victim of domestic violence can apply for Rent Supplement on referral by Tusla or by Tusla-funded service providers. </p>  <p>  My Department provides capital funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) for a range of important and emerging areas of housing need and this includes funding for refuges for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence.</p>  <p>Training is not directly provided by my Department but it is provided by a range of organisations in the sector, including for example, the Irish Council for Social Housing.   </p></reply>

Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4b per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn in funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 18,100 new build social homes in 2022 and 2023, in addition to a further 2,500 social homes through long-term leasing during this same period.  We will also provide additional funding to support households on social housing waiting lists to secure a tenancy, supported by the Housing Assistance Payment, while we increase the supply of housing stock managed by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies. </p>  <p>  The Housing for All strategy contains a multi-pronged approach to improving affordability and increasing the supply of social homes. Some measures such as the Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Other measures such as Cost Rental will deliver approximately 18,000 homes over the period 2021 to 2030. </p>  <p>  The strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  This is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. The Help to Buy scheme also continues to help purchasers to access homes. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the Housing for All strategy provides a range of measures to increase and accelerate the delivery of housing, such as increased funding provided to the Land Development Agency, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative, measures to reduce vacancy rates, and expanded supports for retrofitting existing homes. In addition, the Government has introduced new, higher-rate stamp duty measures and planning permission restrictions to minimise the bulk buying of traditional family homes.</p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will increase the supply of affordable homes and improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home.</p></reply>

As such, they are not covered by the statutory framework for employees on issues such as maternity leave, sick leave and annual leave.</p>  <p>  As matters stand, it is under the provisions of Section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 that councillors may be absent for maternity purposes. Under Section 18, a councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of 6 consecutive months.  Where the absence is due to illness or &ldquo;in good faith for another reason&rdquo;, then the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then to up to 18 months by resolution of the Council.</p>  <p>  A councillor who is absent for 6 months will continue to receive the full amount of his or her Representational Payment, currently worth &euro;25,788 per annum. Thereafter this payment is reduced by 50% for absences of 6 to 12 months duration. A councillor who is absent for more than 12 months will not receive any further payments regardless of the reason for the absence. </p>  <p>  With effect from January 2017, the Social Welfare Acts were amended so that councillors gained access to the same benefits as self-employed contributors.  Accordingly, councillors are now reckonable for the purposes of accessing Class S benefits, including Maternity Benefit.   </p>  <p>  Following the publication of Ms Sara Moorhead S.C.&rsquo;s Review of the Role and Remuneration of Local Authority Elected Members, I approved the establishment of a working group of key local government stakeholders, including councillor representative organisations.  The working group was tasked with drawing up an Action Plan for examination and implementation of the non-pay related recommendations in the Moorhead Report. Addressing these non-pay issues, together with the significant pay reforms for elected members that were approved by Government and brought into effect on 1st July 2021, will facilitate the retention of existing councillors, while also maximising the accessibility of local government to future candidates.  </p>  <p>  As I believe that the issue of maternity leave warrants urgent attention and includes wider matters and supports other than maternity leave, I asked the local government stakeholder working group to establish a subgroup specifically to examine all maternity-related matters for councillors.  This group, which is a representative and cross political party group of women councillors, has met a number of times to date, and has given my officials and I greater understanding of the needs of women councillors in this regard. </p>  <p>  My officials are working closely with the Office of the Attorney General on the legal issues identified.  My intention, over the coming months, is to bring forward a package of maternity-related measures, including proposals for legislative change, which councillors will be able to avail of. </p>  <p>The absence of maternity leave is a perceived obstacle to the participation of women in local government. It is however one that I am determined to address as a matter of urgency, in a progressive and comprehensive manner. This will help to ensure that councillors are more fully representative of the constituents they serve, but also that the role of the councillor is accessible, manageable and sustainable for all.  </p></reply>

A review of the Strategy is underway with a view to preparation of a successor NHSPWD and consultations are ongoing.   </p>  <p>  The Government is determined to ensure that housing policy addresses the needs of those who experience exclusion in our society. There is ongoing and extensive engagement with all local authorities across all delivery streams to ensure maximum delivery of homes for those who need them. I meet regularly with local authorities and I know that they are committed to ensuring that housing is provided to all eligible applicants as speedily as possible and that the support needs of applicants are appropriately assessed.   </p>  <p>  Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland  which was launched earlier this month targets delivery of more homes of all types for people with different housing needs, including delivery of over 10,000 new social homes per year to 2030. </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to housing quality, social housing is built to the design standards set out in the guidelines 'Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities' which are available at www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Housing/FileDownLoad%2C1979%2Cen.pdf. </p>  <p>  In preparing the Guidelines, particular account was taken of the objectives of government policy on sustainability, including access for people with disabilities and meeting varied needs of occupants through their lifetime. The design approach to social housing seeks to eliminate barriers to accessibility for all users - particularly older people and those with mobility impairment or other disability. Where units are being designed for those with disabilities, the Guidelines refer to the National Disability Authority publication 'Building for Everyone: Inclusion, Access and Use'. More recently, the Housing Agency published a Roadmap titled 'Designing Housing to Meet the Needs of All' which has specific regard to the principles of universal design. www.housingagency.ie/sites/default/files/2019-07/Designing-Housing-to-meet-the-needs-of-all.pdf</p>  <p>  To further address the specific housing adaptation needs of disabled people, my Department also provides funding annually for the Disabled Persons Grant (DPG) scheme and the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability scheme, both administered directly by the local authorities.  DPG funding is provided for adaptations and extensions to existing social housing stock to meet specific needs of the local authority tenants, while the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants address specific needs of older people and people with a disability in privately owned homes. </p>  <p>   In respect of rented properties the minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties including those under HAP, comply with the regulations governing the minimum standards for rented accommodation.  Under section 41 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, local authorities are required to commence this inspection process within 8 months of HAP being paid in relation to a particular dwelling if not already inspected within the previous 12 months. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to the 'retrofit' of 500,000 homes to a B2/Cost Optimal Equivalent BER standard by 2030, of which it is expected that approximately 36,500 will be local authority owned homes. A new ten year Energy Efficiency Programme for local authority owned homes was launched in 2021 with a significant increase in funding support to &euro;65 million. This programme will see a significant upscaling (from a &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; to &lsquo;deeper retrofit&rsquo;) on that which has been completed by local authorities in previous years and focuses on ensuring that the fabric of the home is upgraded and an energy efficient heating system is provided.</p></reply>

This timeline was chosen to afford time for necessary research and policy formulation, in consultation with the Residential Tenancies Board. </p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 inserts a new section 19B into the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which applies to tenancies created on or after 9 August 2021, to restrict the total amount that a tenant is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy to no more than the equivalent of 2 months&rsquo; rent (i.e. any deposit cannot exceed 1 month&rsquo;s rent and any advance rent payment cannot exceed 1 month&rsquo;s rent). A restriction of the equivalent of 1 month&rsquo;s rent is also placed on the amount that a tenant is obliged to pay as a regular advance rent payment to a landlord during a tenancy. These measures are intended to greatly reduce any financial exposure to tenants, on foot of paying such restricted upfront payments. </p></reply>

At a time of high housing need, when people are homeless and living in unsuitable accommodation, it is vital that existing vacant homes are brought back into productive use. Pathway 4: 'Addressing Vacancy and Efficient Use of Existing Stock' addresses this issue and sets out a number of key actions in this regard.</p>  <p>  This includes the establishment of a new &lsquo;Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns)&rsquo; Fund for servicing sites to attract people to build their own homes and to refurbish vacant properties in regional towns and villages. My Department is working with the Housing Agency to develop an operational basis for this new fund, which will work alongside other related funds such as the Affordable Housing Fund and complement measures forthcoming in the 'Towns Centre First' policy framework, details of which are expected to be finalised in Q4 2021.</p>  <p>  This Government is firmly committed to a 'Town Centres First' approach which will build upon the ambition set out in Our Rural Future, to support the regeneration, repopulation and development of rural towns and villages. While programmes such as the Urban Regeneration Development Fund (URDF) and the Rural Regeneration Development Fund (RRDF) are primarily intended to support wider town regeneration, they also facilitate optimal use and reuse of existing properties. In this regard, Housing for All commits that further calls for funding under these funds will include specific criteria to encourage the activation of vacant properties and to bring stock back into use. This funding will be integrated with proposals on retrofitting and existing support, such as the Better Energy Homes Grant, to ensure the architectural heritage of towns is preserved.</p>  <p>  I will also review and extend the regulations that exempt certain vacant commercial premises, such as &lsquo;over the shop&rsquo; type spaces, from requiring planning permission for change of use for residential purposes to 2025.</p>  <p>  Many areas of towns and villages, of all sizes, have vacant residential and commercial properties that could be used. If brought back into use, these properties could provide much needed homes and give added vibrancy to our towns and villages. Promoting residential occupancy in our rural towns and villages is at the heart of a &lsquo;Town Centres First&rsquo; approach and Housing for All.</p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings.</p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. This mapping process will take approximately nine months to complete.</p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department proposes to advance interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The SEA process, involving a public consultation on the proposals, is currently underway and is expected to be completed by mid-December 2021. </p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in early 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in early 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. </p></reply>

To resolve these, I asked the  Workplace Relations Commission to engage with all parties aimed at reaching a collective agreement on a Framework for the future delivery of water services. Following a number of bilateral engagements between my Department and trade unions on the broader transformation agenda (on the issues identified in the Policy Paper) initial talks on the IR issues took place under the aegis of the WRC in July. This was the first face to face engagement on the process since the policy paper was published and allowed both sides to clearly set out their positions on the process. It was agreed by both sides that further clarification was required to enable the talks to continue and it was mutually agreed to adjourn the talks further until the Autumn. It is intended that the talks will recommence in the coming weeks. The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

The introduction of the rent increase restriction of 4%  in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) had regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords and takes account of local rental market factors, providing certainty to tenants and landlords with regard to medium-term rent levels.  </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). This measure significantly reduces the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. The linkage with HICP aims to safeguard continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords to deliver the much needed supply of high-quality rental accommodation while protecting against a significant increase in rental inflation in the coming years. </p>  <p>  When bringing forward this legislation, the need to carefully monitor inflation was recognised. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. Given the continuing rise in HICP inflation, up to 3% p.a. in August, I intend to bring forward the Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill 2021 to undergo pre legislative scrutiny by the end of this D&aacute;il term, which will re-examine the operation of RPZs to ensure that effective rent controls are in place while new supply of rental accommodation comes on stream.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. It remains the position that rent reviews in RPZs can occur no more frequently than annually. The most vulnerable tenants, impacted by Covid-19, also continue to be legally protected from rent increases and eviction under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.   </p>  <p>  Having regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords, a blanket extension of the RPZ rent predictability measure to rental properties across the entire country or a three year rent freeze, is considered legally questionable and highly vulnerable to legal challenge.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.  </p>  <p>  The determination of whether an applicant household meets the income criteria is based on a calculation of their preceding 12 months&rsquo; net average income prior to the date of receipt of application. This ensures that the most comprehensive picture of a household&rsquo;s current and previous income is available at the point of carrying out the assessment.</p>  <p>  Social housing support is intended to address a household&rsquo;s long-term housing need. Rent Supplement is a short-term income support for people in the private rented sector. If there has been a recent change in a households circumstance and the household requires short term support with their rent, it is open to them to make application for rent supplement. It remains open to that household to apply for social housing support at any stage, subject to meeting the eligibility and need criteria at the point at which they apply. </p>  <p>  The documentation required with regard to proof of income is set out in the social housing application form. A degree of discretion is permitted to the local authorities as to the extent of documentation the authority deems necessary to ascertain a household&rsquo;s average income over the preceding 12 months in order to satisfy themselves of the household&rsquo;s true income pattern.</p>  <p>  Under Regulation 28 of the Assessment Regulations, a household&rsquo;s qualification for support may be reviewed at the discretion of a local authority or where the authority becomes aware of changes in household circumstances and Regulation 29 provides that the household&rsquo;s qualification for support shall be reassessed at the point of allocation of support. If upon review, a household is found to exceed the limits on income eligibility grounds, for example, they would be removed from the list.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, authorities are also required, when directed by the Minister, to undertake a statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) to count the number of households on the waiting list for social housing supports whose need has not yet been met. The SSHA process requires all local authorities to review those households who are on their housing list but who are not currently in receipt of housing support.</p>  <p>  The oversight and management of the lists of qualified households awaiting accommodation is a matter for the relevant local authority. Decisions on the qualification of specific persons for social housing support and the allocation of that support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned.  </p></reply>

The General Scheme is available on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/34cf6-general-scheme-of-the-electoral-reform-bill-2020.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee carried out a thorough pre-legislative scrutiny process, taking in the views of a wide range of stakeholders and policy experts over seven sessions between January and August of this year. The committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report was published in August and is available from the Oireachtas website at www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/33/housing-local-government-and-heritage/. The recommendations in the report are currently being considered by my Department. My Department is continuing to work with the Attorney General's Office on the drafting of the Electoral Reform Bill and good progress is being made.</p>  <p>  In addition to the legislative work that is being advanced, progress is also being made in respect of the practicalities of the Commission's establishment.  In this regard, a team was put in place earlier in the year and is working on the preparatory institutional and administrative arrangements for the Electoral Commission, pending its formal establishment. </p></reply>

Local authorities have been advised that design- build rapid delivery approaches should be adopted where appropriate to deliver social housing projects on local authority-owned land.</p>  <p>  To support delivery, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) put in place a framework of design-build contractors in 2017. This framework which expired in February 2021, was available for all local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to use in the interest of accelerated delivery.  While some local authorities have progressed projects using the framework, the scope of works was generally limited to certain development sizes and unit types. On this basis, other local authorities have implemented their own frameworks, while some have tendered on individual projects for design-build contractors, on a case by case basis. </p>  <p>  The Housing Delivery and Co-ordination Office and my Department are currently working with the local government sector on replacement frameworks which will operate on a regional basis and cater to a variety of development sizes and unit types, including apartments. In addition, Dublin City Council has developed a framework of design-build contractors for the delivery of a volumetric programme of houses and apartments which is available to all local authorities and AHBs to use on larger projects. It is envisaged that over 1,000 fast-track homes will be built using the Dublin City framework, and while the majority of these will be in Dublin, there will also likely be schemes in other large centres.</p>  <p>  Many of the issues around delivery that non-prefabricated social housing construction projects face, are also faced by design-build projects, such as preparing sites, services/access to the site, community consultation, planning, etc.  There can, however, be savings in terms of programme and construction time with these advantages growing as more use is made of these frameworks and as contractors gain more experience in implementing these methods. Under this mechanism, acceleration is delivered both by the use of the design-build services of specialist contractors and reduced construction time periods due to considerable off site fabrication. As well as off-site construction providing many benefits in terms of delivery and affordability, the new frameworks will provide sustainable and durable quality housing. All new dwellings (including prefabricated and modular build units) must comply with the building regulations and building control requirements and for social housing achieve a 60-year durability for all key elements.</p>  <p>My Department will continue to work with local authorities to maximise delivery and harness appropriate opportunities to deliver on additional build units, including through design-build schemes.   </p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in "Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland", the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered. </p></reply>

In particular, the actions set out under Pathway 3 of the Plan, &quot;Increasing New Housing Supply&quot;, will create the environment needed to enable the supply of over 300,000 new homes by 2030, meaning an annual average of at least 33,000 homes per year. </p><p>Crucially, the Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs. </p><p>In order to ensure there is a sufficient supply of homes across the country, each Local Authority has been given Housing Supply Targets. These, together with updated planning guidance, will ensure sufficient land is zoned for housing. The Government will support this by providing additional State lands to the LDA, capable of delivering up to 15,000 homes. Local authorities will also be funded to acquire additional land so that they can deliver social and affordable homes at scale.</p><p>In addition, <b>Housing for All</b>tasks the LDA, through Project Tosaigh, with intervening in slow or stalled developments on non-State lands, through an open and transparent process, designed to ascertain the potential for it to enter into strategic partnerships with landowners in order to unlock and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes.</p><p>In tandem with these measures to incentivise the bringing forward of supply, there is a need to balance this with penalties for non-activation of sites. In this regard, the Minister for Finance will bring forward a new tax to activate vacant land for residential purposes (to replace the current vacant site levy).</p><p>I am also cognisant that the planning system must be reformed to ensure that there is certainty and stability for those providing housing in Ireland. Under <b>Housing for All</b>the Strategic Housing Development Process will be replaced with new planning arrangements for large-scale residential developments. Such reforms will make decision-making on these developments more efficient whilst returning primary decision-making to the local level.</p><p>The judicial review process will also be reformed and planning legislation will be reviewed to ensure the planning system is plan-led, has greater public acceptance and reflects the needs of existing and new populations. </p><p>In the shorter term, I want to see non-activated planning permissions activated. In this regard, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund will stimulate such activation for apartment developments of four floors or more, above certain densities and these apartments will be for sale to owner occupiers. </p><p>Finally, the delivery an average of 33,000 homes per year requires an expansion of the current workforce. Through the actions laid out in <b>Housing for All</b>industry will be supported in returning existing workers to full employment and there will be proactive engagement with international labour where supply is unavailable locally. There will also be a ramp-up in education and training opportunities, including commitments regarding programmes and apprenticeships and delivery of new courses.</p><p><b>Housing for All </b>takes a genuine whole of Government approach to creating a long-term, sustainable housing system for Ireland. I am confident that the breadth of measures and reforms therein will remove impediments to progress and provide for the much-needed delivery of homes at scale.  </p></reply>

This funding has increased year on year since 2014.  As part of the annual budgetary process, consideration will be given to increasing this funding in future years in line with the Programme for Government commitments and the Policy Statement on Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, which is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/ea33c1-housing-options-for-our-ageing-population-policy-statement/</p>  <p>  The grants include the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant and the Housing Aid for Older People, which are 80% funded by my Department, with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The detailed administration of these schemes including assessment, approval, prioritisation and apportionment between the three schemes  is the responsibility of local authorities. </p>  <p>  My Department's approach every year is to issue a single full year allocation to each local authority, so they can plan and implement the grants programme. Over the course of the year, my Department works closely with the local authorities to monitor spend and to achieve a full drawdown of the available funding. This means that if underspends arise on the part of some local authorities, they can be redistributed to other authorities which have high levels of grant activity. If a local authority is dealing with a high level of applications and is in a position to allocate additional own resources to the grant scheme in 2021, further additional funding can be requested from my Department and every effort will be made to accede to any such request.</p>  <p>  The receipt and processing of housing grant applications can and has continued throughout the pandemic and the carrying out of such works was specifically exempted from the construction restrictions under the public health regulations which were put in place. It is accepted however that the pace has been affected by the effects of wider restrictions and revised work methodologies necessary in response to the pandemic. Inevitably this has led to a backlog of applications in some local authorities.

The plenary working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021, (with the exception of August) in addition to subgroup meetings. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference were adopted in May 2021 and include:</p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;. </p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect, </p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage, </p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected, </p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected. </p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated. </p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action. </p><p>5. In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management. </p><p>6. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including: </p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings, </p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work, </p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.  </p><p>7. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options. </p><p>8. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance. </p><p>9. To report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others to examine the issue of defects in housing and report to me on the matter. Consultation with the relevant parties has commenced and further arrangements in this  regard are currently being put in place by the working group.</p><p>I am satisfied that the group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter and I look forward to a report in due course following completion of their deliberation. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents. </p><p>Any further speculation or discussion on the output of the working group is premature at this stage.</p></reply>

It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum.</p><p>Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.</p><p>Specifically regarding middle-income families wishing to buy homes, the Housing for All strategy contains a multi-pronged approach to improving affordability.</p><p>The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p><p>In addition to these distinct shared equity schemes, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes.</p><p>Further to the above, the Housing for All strategy also provides the following supports;</p><p>- increased funding provided to the Land Development Agency,</p><p>- the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative intended to service sites and refurbish existing vacant properties in regional towns and villages,</p><p>- a higher stamp duty rate for institutional investors that purchase family homes,</p><p>- increased regulation of short-term letting properties.</p><p>- additional measures to reduce vacancy rates, and</p><p>- expanded supports for retrofitting existing homes.</p><p>Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home. </p><p>With regard to the issue of mortgage requirements, these requirements are governed by the Central Bank of Ireland which retains independence in the establishment of macro-prudential policy and mortgage measures.</p><p>Information in this regard, including on exemptions and other matters, is available at the following Central Bank links: </p><p>www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explainers/what-are-the-mortgage-measures, and</p><p>www.centralbank.ie/financial-system/financial-stability/macro-prudential-policy/mortgage-measures.</p></reply>

The periods of lockdown since early 2020 have reduced construction activity and placed limitations on the ability to conduct normal sales activity, and this has impacted on house prices. The considerable growth in household savings, related to the public health restrictions which reduced consumption, also seems likely to be contributing to recent price inflation. </p>  <p>  The ongoing removal of Covid restrictions will allow for a full reopening of the housing market.  CSO data regarding new dwellings completions for Quarter 2 shows that the rate of completions is increasing and the effects of the periods of lockdown are abating.  Data on planning permissions and commencements are also showing a significant increase over this period.  </p>  <p>  The full opening up of the housing market and construction activity, along with the increases in supply that will be delivered by the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All Plan, will ensure that housing market activity normalises, and supply increases to meet demand as the Plan is implemented. </p>  <p>  As a matter of course in the development of housing policy or schemes, account is taken of the intended or potential impacts of the measures under consideration. Further, the governance approach set out in Housing for All  will provide the mechanism to consider the sequencing and timing of the rollout of demand side measures with delivery of supply side reforms.  The Housing for All Delivery Group and my Department will monitor and prioritise delivery and sequencing of actions, having regarding to relevant market trends including impacts on house prices, where appropriate.      </p></reply>

The Guidelines are available on the Government&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/23809-sustainable-rural-housing-development-guidelines/. </p>  <p>  Since 2018, the National Planning Framework (NPF) is the national planning policy document providing overall strategic policy for the future development of Ireland. National Planning Objective (NPO) 19 aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant &lsquo;overspill&rsquo; development pressure from urban areas within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and remoter rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other. </p>  <p>  NPO 19 is aligned with the established planning approach as per the 2005 Guidelines, whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part-time) need may be applied by planning authorities in certain rural areas under urban influence in order to prevent urban sprawl.</p>  <p>  A working group was established to review and, where necessary, recommend changes to the 2005 Guidelines and this group met on five occasions between May 2017 and January 2019.  During this period, in 2018, the National Planning Framework (the NPF) was published and provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared by my Department to ensure consistency with new requirements and legislation at national and EU level introduced in respect of areas related to rural housing such as environmental protection, the Gaeltacht and climate action. The new guidelines will ensure a more consistent approach between counties and alignment with NPF objectives, and will be published in draft before the end of 2021.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provides for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living. </p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Part V homes are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland, commits to maintain the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments Housing for All are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

The cost and supply issues that have arisen for basic building materials such as steel, timber, concrete and plastics are also occurring internationally. They appear to result from a range of contributory factors including Brexit, the disruption caused by Covid 19, increased global demand and other global events that have impacted on supply chains.  Reducing residential construction costs is a key theme within Housing for All, with actions centred on analysis, innovation, research and productivity through a whole-of-government approach in collaboration with Industry. </p>  <p>  The Housing for All Strategy delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum.</p>  <p>  Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. </p>  <p>  Specifically regarding middle-income families wishing to buy homes, the Housing for All strategy contains a multi-pronged approach to improving affordability. </p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p>  <p>  In addition to these distinct shared equity schemes, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes. </p>  <p>  Further to the above, the Housing for All strategy also provides the following supports;</p>  <p>  - increased funding provided to the Land Development Agency,</p>  <p>  - the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative intended to service sites and refurbish existing vacant properties in regional towns and villages,</p>  <p>  - a higher stamp duty rate for institutional investors that purchase family homes,</p>  <p>  - increased regulation of short-term letting properties.</p>  <p>  - additional measures to reduce vacancy rates, and</p>  <p>  - expanded supports for retrofitting existing homes.</p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home.</p></reply>

The Building Regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query, Part M of the Building Regulations deals with Access and Use. The associated Technical Guidance Document M provides guidance indicating how the requirements of Part M can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with TGD M, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part M of the Second Schedule of the Building Regulations.</p>  <p>  Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, my Department established a Working Group to examine the provision for a changing places toilet in certain buildings. A changing places toilet offers larger supported facilities that address the needs of people for whom current accessible sanitary accommodation is inadequate. These facilities enable people with complex care needs to take part in everyday activities such as travel, shopping, family days out or attending a sporting event.</p>  <p>  The plenary Working Group has met six times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings.  Draft documentation, which includes Draft Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2021, Draft Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use 2021 and a Regulatory Impact Analysis, is currently being prepared to support a public consultation in the matter later this year.</p></reply>

Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and ensure that such applications are dealt with within timeframes that are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum. Different timescales may apply where the local authority requires additional information from the applicant within the relevant period, as defined in the Regulations, thus leading to possible extensions to the 12 week deadline in terms of completing the application process.</p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges faced throughout 2020 and into 2021 due to the Covid emergency measures, local authorities and the Housing Assistance Payment Shared Service Centre (HAP SSC) have continued to provide a critical service to all HAP customers. </p>  <p>  Measures that were required to be taken in the context of Covid-19 did, however, have an impact on processing times for HAP applications. </p>  <p>  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP SSC. If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord may be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority. The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.</p>  <p>My Department and the local authorities are aware of the importance of minimising HAP processing times and the critical need to keep this under review at a local level, in order to ensure times are minimised to the greatest extent possible. This has been communicated clearly to the County and City Management Association (CCMA), and my Department is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to do so over the coming months.  </p></reply>

This represents an average of 2,000 per year.  In building to this scale, the State will provide certain focused funding supports to help delivery partners provide rental homes that target affordable rents at levels in the order of 25% below market rents.</p>  <p>  A range of work is already ongoing to deliver Cost Rental housing, with State support, through a number of avenues. Under Budget 2021, &euro;35 million was allocated to the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, designed to facilitate Government loans to Approved Housing Bodies, to finance up to 30% of the capital costs of new homes for Cost Rental. My Department is utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), to deliver initial Cost Rental projects.</p>  <p>A total of 390 Cost Rental homes were approved under this first tranche of CREL funding. The first 25 of these homes, and the first Cost Rental homes to be designated in Ireland, were acquired by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan, and the first tenants moved in on 28 August 2021. In addition to these 390 homes, another 50 Cost Rental apartments are currently being constructed at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, alongside 105 social housing units.

The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p>  <p>  In addition to these distinct shared equity schemes, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes.</p>  <p>  Further to the above, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative intended to service sites and refurbish existing vacant properties in regional towns and villages,</p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home.</p></reply>

These recommendations arise from the surveys of my Department's National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH).</p>  <p>  Its inclusion on Tipperary County Council's RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of Knocklofty House and also gives the Council powers to deal with development proposals affecting it and to seek to safeguard its future.

In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). The addition of  Wild Nephin area and also, separately a private acquisition of 1,200 acres at Altnabrockey has  expanded the total size of the Park to over 15,000 hectares of Atlantic blanket bogs and mountainous terrain in the Barony of Erris in northwest County Mayo. The expansion adds significantly to the overall biological diversity of the National Park which will be augmented further under Park conservation management.<b></b>The culmination of constructive engagement between Coillte and my Department, the expansion of the Park addresses a long standing strategy to align key environmental assets and an exceptional opportunity has been realised for the State. This transfer underlines the State&rsquo;s determination in preserving our natural heritage not only for ourselves, but also for our children and our children&rsquo;s children.</p><p>The Wild Nephin Area is an important area for nature conservation and public amenity and through a state &ndash; owned re-wilding project  we aim to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as  enhanced recreational and social benefits in Wild Nephin National Park.  The Nephin Wilderness Project is designed to manage the conversion of the former commercial forestry section of the National Park over a 15-year period which will act as Phase 1 of a long-term vision to restore habitats and biodiversity within an intensively managed area.</p><p>The Project is guided by a Wild Nephin Conversion Plan 2022 &ndash; 2037 which focuses on the principles of rewilding and habitat restoration to convert an area previously managed for timber extraction of non-native conifers to an area which prioritises biodiversity, restores ecosystems and promotes sustainable interactions between people and nature. This plan will cover the conversion of the area known as the Nephin Forest and its integration into the National Park. The Wild Nephin Conversion Plan (Phase I) will facilitate the rewilding and restoration of the landscapes and habitats of Wild Nephin, allowing natural ecological processes to become the dominant drivers of the landscape, where biodiversity is enhanced, ecosystems restored, and low impact recreation opportunities will connect people with nature across generations.</p><p>The rewilding and habitat restoration of Wild Nephin aims to support a natural and biodiverse ecosystem which will provide a connection to a larger community of life by encouraging the enjoyment of nature, solitude and challenging recreation without creating a significant human impact on this area of outstanding natural beauty, where nature is the priority. The project is based on actions to be taken in the first 15 years of habitat restoration through the establishment of goals which are informed by the overall nature conservation objectives of the NPWS alongside national and international legislation, policies and agreements. These include links with the Natura 2000 Network, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Paris Climate Agreement and the Bern Convention alongside links in with strategies such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and the current situation globally in regards to biodiversity loss and the climate crisis. </p></reply>

Such analysis will provide the evidential basis necessary for the consideration of any extension of the scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department is in ongoing engagement with local authorities in respect of discussions on requests for an extension of the scheme and the relevant local authorities have positively engaged with this process. A submission in this regard has already been received from Clare County Council and that is under review and further submissions are expected from other local authorities with whom my Department is engaging.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns being raised by homeowners in relation to the Defective Concrete Block grant scheme, I established a time-bound working group, with representatives from my Department, the local authorities and homeowner representative groups who are tasked with reviewing the operation of the scheme and providing a report with recommendations originally by 31st July. Included within the terms of reference of the working group is the issue of eligible homes and the extension of the scheme to other local authority areas.  </p>  <p>  At the request of homeowners and in order to afford them more time to consider and respond to key issues under discussion, it was agreed at the meeting held on the 27th July that the timeline for the submission of a report by the working group would be extended to the end of September, 2021. Once the deliberations of the Group have concluded, I will, following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General, bring proposals to Government.</p></reply>

Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4b per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn in funding through the Housing Finance Agency.

The Council members agreed in March 2020 to progress the procurement process and proceed to land disposal under the relevant legislation to accelerate the delivery of much needed affordable homes in the area. In addition, 125 social homes will be delivered as part of this development.  The land associated with these homes is not included in the approved disposal.  </p></reply>

Once a conspicuous part of Ireland&rsquo;s landscape, they were driven to extinction by human persecution here in the late Nineteenth Century. The first Phase ran from 2007-2011, managed by NPWS and the Golden Eagle Trust, when 100 chicks were released into the wild. Since then, over 35 Irish-born chicks have fledged here, some of whom have begun to rear their own chicks. Indeed, this year one nesting pair on Lough Derg produced three chicks. This is uncommon, even in the very extensive wild populations in Norway.</p>  <p>  The Second Phase was launched last year, when ten Norwegian-born chicks were flown into Ireland and released into the wild on the Shannon Estuary and Lough Derg. Of these ten, an astonishing nine are still alive, and have travelled throughout the country, with one even travelling to Scotland.</p>  <p>  In August 2021, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department and partners  released a further twenty-one Norwegian-born Eagle chicks into the wild to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s existing White-Tailed Eagle population from a number of locations in Cork, Kerry, Clare and Waterford. They were collected from nests by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in June this year, and were imported to Ireland via Kerry Airport.  They were kept in purpose-built enclosures while they grew, matured, and developed the feathers and muscles necessary for flight. </p>  <p>  All 21 of the chicks are out in the natural environment and doing well.  The birds will remain local for another 4/5 weeks and will then move out to explore and find new areas.  All of the eagles are satellite tagged and readings are taken every day to discern their movements and locations.</p>  <p>  The success of both this year's and last year&rsquo;s releases was thanks to the hard work of both the NPWS staff and the input and assistance of other interested parties. These include representatives of the IFA, the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, and in particular local landowners and farmers, without whose enthusiastic support in monitoring nest sites and care of birds the Project could not succeed. The Project represent the ongoing cooperation of these different groups who are seeking to restore a lost element of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage.</p>  <p>  Returning this lost flagship species to Irish skies will be a huge step in restoring Irish natural heritage and improving Irish conservation efforts, and will benefit Irish biodiversity more broadly.</p></reply>

In many cases, however, the use of compulsory purchase  powers is not necessary as agreement to purchase can be reached between the Local Authority and the property owner. To assist them in pursuing vacant properties, my Department introduced the Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme to facilitate the acquisition and remediation of vacant properties that may be suitable for social housing. Through this support mechanism, Local Authorities have delivered over 700 social housing homes to date and as outlined Housing for All I am keen to see further delivery in this way.</p>  <p>  In addition, action 19.5 of Housing for All provides for a programme of CPO acquisitions, supported by a bridging finance facility from the Housing Finance Agency, which will allow Local Authorities to maximise opportunities to return vacant properties to productive use.   </p>  <p>  The objective of the programme, which will be introduced by the end of 2021, is for Local Authorities to acquire up to 2,500 vacant units by 2026 and present them to the open market for sale.</p>  <p>The Housing Agency will assist and advise Local Authorities with the CPO process.  Vacant Homes Officers, already in situ in each Local Authority, will be responsible for driving this programme forward.  </p></reply>

In summary, an eligible employee is entitled to two week&rsquo;s remuneration per year.

The weekly remuneration is subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.</p>  <p>  The amount an eligible worker will receive will depend on the length of time they were placed on layoff due to Covid-19, and not otherwise working, before the date they were made redundant.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to assess how many redundancies are likely to unfold in the economy which, in turn, informs cost projections.  While many sectors are expected to rebound relatively quickly once restrictions are lifted, redundancies in some businesses are still likely.</p>  <p>It is worth emphasising that there has been an effective ban on employees claiming redundancy since March 2020 and there has been very few insolvencies during this time.  It is expected that this will inevitably change as the economy fully re-opens and Covid related financial supports for businesses are phased out.  </p></reply>

The lists are reviewed twice a year to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements. The lists are subject to twice yearly evidenced based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, a public consultation process, input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19 and their impact on the labour market. Officials from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are represented on the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group.   </p>  <p>  In order to add or remove an occupation from the lists, evidence is sought demonstrating that recruitment difficulties are solely due to genuine shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Sectors are also required to engage structurally with the public employment service of the Department of Social Protection. The review process invites stakeholders, through the public consultation, to provide data to substantiate claims of lack of skills or labour available in a detailed evidence-based business case.   </p>  <p>  A review of the occupation lists commenced with a public consultation  on 1st July. The closing date for receipt of submissions was 12th August and 26 were received from a range of sectors including the horticulture sector. As outlined above the review process involves engagement with the relevant policy Departments as well as consideration of the submissions and available labour market research by the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group which is currently underway.

The NBP roll out is currently a 7 year plan under the contract and deployment is due to be complete by the end of 2026.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NBI that, as of 17 September, over 250,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed with over 108,000 premises under construction in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. </p>  <p>  The network rollout for the National Broadband Plan is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the eir exchanges or the state owned metropolitan area networks (MANs). It is based on an engineering design that allows NBI to get to every premises as quickly as possible working within the confines of how fibre networks are built. Given the nature of the build and ongoing work to address the impact of Covid-19 related delays, it is not possible to give specific details on a per county basis out to 2026. NBI has indicated that c. 130,000 to 145,000 premises will be passed across all counties over 2021 and 2022.</p></reply>

A new National Retrofit Plan will be published in quarter 4 of this year. The plan is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: customer proposition and demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity, and governance.  </p>  <p>  SEAI grant schemes will be a central element of the Government's approach to achieving our retrofit targets.  It is intended to launch a new National Retrofit Scheme focused on achieving B2 retrofits later this year.  The existing SEAI grant schemes will be aligned with the National Retrofit Scheme as appropriate.  </p>  <p>This year, some &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes, including the Solar PV scheme and the Building Energy Rating programme.  This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes.  It is important to note that extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between January and mid-April had a significant impact on activity this year.  Output has also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials.

These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 17 September, 373 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Castledaly Community Centre, Ballycomoyle GAA Club, Milltown Emper Community Centre, Whitehall Community Centre, Streete Parish Park &amp;amp; Community Hall, and Clonkill Hurling Club. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Naomh Micheal, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhride, and Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Aodha Naofa have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

It will also help Ireland to move towards our 70% renewable electricity target by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.   The option of undergrounding the North-South interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions. Most recently, the key finding from the International Expert Commission's report of October 2018 was that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this critical electricity infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I decided to commission a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid. Terms of reference for this study were published on my Department's website on 21 April. On 7 May, my Department initiated a procurement process to appoint an independent expert to undertake the review. International consultants have now been appointed subject to final contract compliance requirements being fulfilled. I expect that the review will be completed later this year.  </p></reply>

The network rollout for the National Broadband Plan is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. Counties are generally made up of a number of DAs which means there are differing timescales for connection across county areas. </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network in the immediate term, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. </p></reply>

EirGrid is the transmission system operator and its responsibilities include the appropriate development of the grid and power system to achieve our energy policy objectives and underpin economic development.  The CRU is the independent energy regulator and, through a formal price review process, it decides on appropriate spend by EirGrid on a five-year basis.   The most recent price review decision by the CRU in December 2020 on the allowable spend on our electricity grid over the next five years signalled a significant and necessary increase in funds for grid enhancement. EirGrid already seeks to optimise the existing electricity grid to minimise the need for new infrastructure through upgrades, refurbishment or up-voltaging of existing infrastructure, where possible. However, in light of the Government's ambition to have at least 70% renewable electricity on the power system by 2030, and with demand profiles increasing as we continue to electrify more sectors of our economy, including heat and transport, further investment in the power grid will be required over the coming decade.</p>  <p>  The CRU as part of its oversight has issued a final determination for funding over the next five years to the end of 2025 (PR5 - Price Review 5) which can be found on the CRU website. It indicates a capital investment of &euro;4bn across the transmission and distribution network. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year EirGrid carried out a public consultation on 'Shaping our Electricity Future'. The aim is to make the electricity grid stronger and more flexible so that it can carry significantly more renewable generation as well as meet increasing demand from high volume energy users such as data centres.  Publication of the outcome of the consultation is expected later this year.  </p></reply>

I am advised by NBI that, as of 17 September 2021, over 257,000 premises in the Intervention Area across all counties have been surveyed and over 108,000 premises are under construction across 30 Deployment Areas.</p><p>I am advised by NBP that the following represents the deployment progress in County Mayo as at the 17 September. <table>    <tr>       <th>Mayo - Surveys complete</th>       <th>Mayo - Surveys ongoing <br /><br /></th>       <th>Anticipated dates for premises to be passed and available for connection  <br /><br /></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8,281 Premises in areas around   Castlebar (2,139), Ballina (2,678)  Newport (1,826)Carrowmorelacken (1,638)</td>       <td>1,008 Premises in areas around Killadoon. </td>       <td>Castlebar H1, 2022<br /><br />Ballina  H2, 2022</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 17 September, 373 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at The Black Tom Freeman Sport and Community Amenities Centre, Islandeady Community Centre, Kilmovee Community Centre, Killaser Community Centre, Clare Island Community Centre, Cushlough Community Centre, Carrowkennedy, Keel Community Centre, Belderrig Community &amp;amp; Research Centre, Finny Community Centre, Taugheen Community Centre, and Bofeenaun Community Centre.

My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.

NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. </p>  <p>  My officials queried the specific issue raised in the Question with NBI who confirmed that this Eircode was always scheduled to be in the later end of the build programme. The network rollout for the National Broadband Plan is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. Counties are generally made up of a number of DAs which means there are differing timescales for connection across county areas. </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network in the immediate term, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is under way. </p></reply>

The other four projects are : </p><p>- DART+ West; </p><p>- DART+ South West; </p><p>- DART+ Coastal South; and </p><p>- DART+ Fleet.</p><p>Naturally there is a sequencing to the delivery of these different projects as each sits within the overall programme framework and it is also the case that the success of some of the projects depends on the early delivery of other projects.</p><p>Key to the overall programme is the delivery of DART+ West which is the most advanced project.  Its early delivery is particularly important due to the new depot to be constructed which will facilitate the huge expansion of the fleet.  I understand the second round of public consultation is underway in relation to the project with a closing date of 6th October. </p><p>Next is DART+ South West on which an initial public consultation has already taken place, with a second one planned before the end of the year.</p><p>Turning to the DART+ Coastal projects, I am informed that a design team was appointed earlier in the year.  Work has begun on the preliminary design and the preparation of an emerging preferred option which will then be the subject of a public consultation and will inform the preparation of the necessary planning documentation. It is only when these necessary steps are much more advanced that a more definitive project timeline will emerge. </p><p>Finally, there is DART+ Fleet which is of particular importance to the current Northern Line as it will enable improved services on the line in advance of the later electrification.  This will be achieved through the use of battery-electric units on the current Northern Line and will mean improved and expanded services for passengers.  A preferred bidder has been identified however, it is too early at this stage to give an indicative date as regards when one can expect to see the new fleet introduced into service but that should become a lot clearer in the next few months as contracts are signed and commitments made.</p><p>However, I would note that the Northern Line will also benefit from the introduction in 2023 of new ICRs which are currently under construction and which will provide a welcome boost to capacity and services in the short term.</p></reply>

At end June it was estimated that ore than &euro;300 million has been made available to the aviation sector through a number of these general cross-economy schemes.  Liquidity support through commercial lending in the order of &euro;190m has been made available to Aer Lingus and the daa through the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).</p>  <p>  In addition, a further &euro;80 million is being provided to support the airports, as announced last year, through the Regional Airports Programme and the additional flexibility that is a allowed under EU State aid rules to redress damage arising from exceptional events such as the global pandemic. This will enable the airports to offer route incentives to restore connectivity.</p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan launched, in June this year, with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the COVID-19 pandemic, set out new measures, and provided for the continuation of business supports. This plan also recognised the potential need for additional supports for the aviation sector.

The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. The forthcoming updated Climate Action Plan 2021 retains this commitment to transforming the national vehicle fleet to a zero emissions fleet, and contains a range of measures to support the public and business in transitioning to electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made, as a result of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 43,500 now. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The EVPP Working Group comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  </p>  <p>  The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government  and the full report is now available online. </p>  <p>  In order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that:  </p>  <p>  - The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and   </p>  <p>  - An Office for Low Emission Vehicles should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new Office should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. </p>  <p>  Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. </p></reply>

Both face imminent and important milestones in the coming months and these milestones will determine the progress of each in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Firstly, there is Government&rsquo;s approval of the Preliminary Business Case and secondly there is the submission of a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  On that first milestone, my Department has received draft Preliminary Business Cases for both.  This represents Decision Gate 1 under the Public Spending Code and those Preliminary Business Cases are currently under review. </p>  <p>  For major projects, like DART+ and MetroLink, the Public Spending Code requires a Government decision and I expect to seek such a Government decision in the near future.  If approved by Government, that will allow the contracts to be signed in relation to DART+ Fleet and will also allow MetroLink and DART+ West move into the statutory planning system, subject to the completion of the necessary planning and environmental documentation. </p>  <p>  The second impending milestone is the submission of Railway Order applications for DART+ West and MetroLink. Those applications require the finalisation of an extensive set of documentation, including environmental impact assessment reports, and that work is ongoing in relation to both projects.  </p>  <p>  On MetroLink I understand that an extensive body of work remains in relation to finalising the preliminary design, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues.  This should be completed during Q1 next year and, subject to the Government decision mentioned above, the project will then be ready to seek planning permission.  </p>  <p>  On DART+, the most advanced of the proposed infrastructure projects is DART+ West. The second round of public consultation on DART+ West has recently been extended until 6th October.  Issues raised during this consultation process, including those raised by public representatives, will need to be fully considered by the company and appropriately addressed before they&rsquo;re ready to enter the planning system.  Once that has been completed, and similar to MetroLink, DART+ West can then move into the planning system subject to the aforementioned Government approval and finalisation of planning documentation.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the current position.</p></reply>

Bus lanes are designed to make bus journeys both faster and more reliable so as to encourage members of the public out of their cars and onto public transport. This, in turn, reduces both congestion and air pollution and is considerably more environmentally sustainable than car-based transport in the long run. As the populations of our urban centres multiply and public awareness of the importance of sustainable transport grows, it is likely that both bus passenger numbers and, by extension, the provision of bus services and the demand for bus lanes will continue to increase year on year. As a result it is critically important that bus lanes be allowed serve the purpose for which they were installed in the first place.</p>  <p>  Since bus lanes were first introduced, there have been many requests to allow other classes of traffic to use the lanes. These have included requests on behalf of motorcyclists, multi-occupancy vehicles, electric vehicles, hackneys, animal ambulances, prison vehicles, and others. My predecessors as Ministers for Transport and myself have always consistently rejected these requests on the grounds that any addition to the categories of vehicle permitted to use the lanes would inevitably reduce their efficiency for performing their original purpose, which has become even more critical in light of the current climate emergency.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. </p>  <p>  The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post 2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.</p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (NDP), as it stands, there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding for regional and local roads, particularly in the last four years.  Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate protection and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the protection and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.</p>  <p>  Any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration for funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code (PSC) and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF). </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that Louth County Council sought funding for the proposed Port Access Northern Cross Route (PANCR) under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) which is administered by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG). There was some discussion between Louth County Council and my Department this year regarding the project appraisal process if the scheme were to be submitted to my Department for consideration. To date no formal application has been received by this Department from Louth County Council in relation to the proposed PANCR and my Department has not had any engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the scheme.</p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS. </p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;4.8 billion and PRSI credit of almost &euro;770 million have been granted to 51,400 employers in respect of over 660,000 workers. </p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made in June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. </p>  <p>  Further, as announced today, the Government has agreed that there will be no change to the EWSS for the month of October 2021, which means that the scheme will continue to operate in its current form as per the arrangements for Q3 2021. Issues around the configuration of the scheme beyond October are currently being considered and full details will be announced on Budget Day, 12 October 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

In addition there is a commitment to bring new homes, which were outside the LPT, into the taxation system. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 fulfils the Programme for Government commitments in this area and secures the future of the Local Property Tax (LPT). The 2021 Act provides inter alia that residential properties built since 2013 will be liable for LPT for 2022 onwards.  I have no plans to alter this position.  The vast majority of residential property owners have been paying LPT since 2013 and their situation vis-&agrave;-vis property owners who have remained outside the scope of LPT has become highly inequitable and untenable. I am very concerned that this inequity does not continue into 2022 when property owners at 1 May 2013 are due to pay LPT based on their new value as at 1 November 2021. Deferring LPT as suggested in the deputy&rsquo;s question would have the effect of continuing this inequitable situation and I do not see any basis for doing so.</p>  <p>  Any residential property owners experiencing financial difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options in respect of LPT. The full range of payment options, which includes phased arrangements, are available to property owners via the LPT portal on the Revenue website. Residential property owners can make direct contact with Revenue at telephone number (01) 7383626 or by writing to LPT Branch, PO Box 1, Limerick, where every effort will be made to agree a suitable payment arrangement.    </p>  <p>  Revenue has engaged extensively with residential property owners who are experiencing financial difficulties since the pandemic began to agree flexible LPT payment arrangements that best suit their circumstances and avoid unnecessary hardship, and it has assured me that this will continue to be the case.   </p>  <p>  The LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed.  Interest is charged on the deferred amount. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 provides that for 2022 the deferral income thresholds will be increased to &euro;18,000 for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple. In addition, the rate of interest charged on deferred LPT liabilities will be reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent annually.</p></reply>

In such circumstances, the taxpayer or tax agent should contact Revenue as quickly as possible, via the MyEnquiries service, setting out the exceptional difficulties being encountered so that an alternative arrangement can be agreed and put in place.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;best estimate&rsquo; arrangement is in place to facilitate taxpayers or tax agents in rectifying errors that occurred because all the relevant information required was not to hand at the time the return was filed due to COVID-19 difficulties. The arrangement allows for self-correction of the return without incurring penalties.  </p>  <p>  Finally, and as previously advised to the Deputy, the timely filing of tax returns is essential so that taxpayers and businesses can continue to avail of the very substantial Government supports that are available to offset the extreme economic difficulties caused by COVID-19. Where returns are outstanding, it is not possible for Revenue to calculate outstanding liabilities for the Debt Warehousing scheme or to provide tax clearance, which is a key eligibility requirement for the other subsidy schemes (EWSS, CRSS and BRSS). </p></reply>

A detailed reply was issued in that instance (Dail Question No. 217 - Reference 42979/21) and there have been no substantive developments or adjustments to the previous answer in the interim period.</p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), which is provided by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2020, was introduced to support businesses (companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships) significantly affected by restrictions introduced by the Government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The CRSS operates on a self-assessment basis, and claimants are required to satisfy themselves that they are correctly eligible for the scheme before registering to receive payments. Claimants are also required to review their continued eligibility for the scheme before making a claim for payment in respect of each subsequent claim period.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the CRSS, a business must operate from a business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, requiring it to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its premises. It is not sufficient that a business experiences a reduction in demand for its services or a reduced footfall because of the general public health guidelines around social distancing and related protective measures which apply to society as a whole.  For example, dry cleaning and laundry businesses were not required to restrict customer access under the public health measures and as such do not qualify for the CRSS, even if service demand is reduced. Such businesses may however qualify for the other support schemes introduced to support them during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question operates a dry-cleaning service and incorrectly claimed and received CRSS payments to which it was not entitled, which must be repaid in due course. Revenue has also confirmed that it accepts that the business genuinely believed that it qualified for the scheme and that repayment of the amount owed as a single payment could cause it financial difficulties. To avoid such a scenario to the greatest extent possible, Revenue will engage directly with the business to agree a suitable payment solution, including the possibility of adding the amount owed to its current warehoused debt under the Debt Warehousing Scheme, even though that scheme does not specifically provide for CRSS related liabilities.</p>  <p>  The company may be also eligible to register for the new Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), which is an additional support for businesses with reduced turnover due to COVID-19 related restrictions.

This includes Jobseekers Benefit and any weekly payments for adult dependants. </p>  <p>  The way in which tax is collected from DSP payments is dependent on whether a person is taxed through the PAYE system or through self-assessment. Where a person has a PAYE source of income only, Revenue reduces his or her annual tax credits and rate band to take account of any taxable DSP payments, thereby ensuring the tax due is automatically collected through the payroll system. I am advised by Revenue that this arrangement was correctly applied to the person concerned while she was in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit. </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it has reviewed the tax record of the person and is satisfied that the correct tax credits, standard rate band and Universal Social Charge (USC) allocations have been applied to her current employment, following notification from DSP that her Jobseekers Benefit claim had &lsquo;closed&rsquo;. The overpayments that occurred for 2021 will be refunded to her through her payroll. Such overpayments arise where any delay occurs in notifying Revenue that a person has resumed employment and is no longer in receipt of Jobseekers Benefit. Revenue has also confirmed that the person is not exempt from USC as her expected income for 2021 will exceed the exemption threshold of &euro;13,000.00. </p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has advised me that it has already had direct engagement with the person in question and has clarified how the overpayments of tax by her occurred and how the amounts owed to her will be refunded. Revenue also clarified her USC status and provided her with a direct contact should she require any further clarification or advice.</p></reply>

On 1 July 2021, the OECD Inclusive Framework reached agreement but not unanimous consensus on key aspects of the two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalisation and globalisation.</p>  <p>  I have been clear in expressing my broad support for the agreement but have expressed reservation, in particular, about the proposed global minimum effective tax rate of &lsquo;at least 15%&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of the OECD proposals, I felt it timely to invite views on the OECD proposals. The consultation provided an opportunity to identify the challenges and opportunities of the proposals in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax code and broader industrial policy.</p>  <p>  As you will know, on 20 July I launched a public consultation on the OECD International Tax Proposals, the consultation period ran until 10th September. </p>  <p>  Responses to the consultation came from a broad spectrum of society including from interested citizens, business, business representative bodies, civil society, accountancy firms and bodies, law firms, and political parties.</p>  <p>  The responses received indicated broad support for the OECD process, as a well as a strong level of support for the position the Government adopted in relation to the proposals.  There was an acknowledgement that there is need for further detail before committing to any agreement.  Additional points raised noted the need to focus on Ireland&rsquo;s overall FDI attractiveness into the future including with a focus on non-tax elements.  The need to have jurisdictions withdraw unilateral measures, such as domestic digital taxes, was further noted for any agreement to succeed and bring about the stability to the international tax framework that we all crave. </p>  <p>  My Officials and I will further consider the technical details of submissions received and this will inform my thinking as we approach what is a critical juncture of these negotiations at the OECD&rsquo;s Inclusive Framework meeting on 8 October.  </p>  <p>  In respect to the publication of the submissions, it is my intention to publish these submissions on the Department of Finance website, as is the norm for public consultations run by the Department of Finance, in due course. </p></reply>

As an economy wide support, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme has the objective of supporting all employment and maintaining the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS is open to all businesses, provided the business meets the requisite conditions of the scheme. The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;4.8 billion and PRSI credit of almost &euro;770 million have been granted to 51,400 employers in respect of over 660,000 workers. </p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made in June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. </p>  <p>  Further, as announced today, the Government has agreed that there will be no change to the EWSS for the month of October 2021, which means that the scheme will continue to operate in its current form as per the arrangements for Q3 2021. Issues around the configuration of the scheme beyond October are currently being considered and full details will be announced on Budget Day, 12 October 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time. </p></reply>

The scheme operated from 26 March 2020 to 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020. The TWSS was introduced as an emergency measure, providing vital financial support to employers and employees that were severely impacted by the pandemic. </p><p>The TWSS operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully met the eligibility criteria for the scheme before making a claim. To assist employers in determining their eligibility, Revenue published extensive guidance, which clearly set out the qualifying conditions. Revenue also deployed very significant resources to a TWSS Helpline to answer queries by potential TWSS claimants.  </p><p>The scheme was not intended as a support to domestic employers nor was it ever implied that it applied to them. The employment of domestic staff by a householder is not a business activity. A relevant business in the context of the TWSS generally included manufacturing, buying, selling, or supplying goods or services with a view to making a profit, none of which can be associated with employing domestic staff. It was also not possible for a domestic employer to meet the key criteria of a 25% reduction in turnover in Q2 of 2020 as there is no turnover associated with engaging a domestic employee.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that a small number of employers of domestic staff incorrectly claimed TWSS in respect of domestic staff, the majority of which have since repaid the amounts owed in full. Where these domestic employers did not repay the subsidies owed, Revenue issued assessments for the amounts due as provided for in the legislation. The amounts owed were classified as &lsquo;relevant tax&rsquo; and the Notice of Assessment advised the persons concerned of their statutory right to appeal the assessment to the independent Tax Appeals Commission (TAC). Full details of the procedures for making an appeal against any Revenue assessment, including in respect of late appeals, are available on the TAC website at <i>www.taxappeals.ie.</i></p></reply>

Loss relief works by allowing a deduction for losses incurred in one accounting period against profits earned in another period.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query, section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 precludes Revenue officials from directly or indirectly disclosing taxpayer information to third parties in respect of specific taxpayers. Therefore it is not possible to provide estimates based on such a small cohort of taxpayers.  However, based on public information as to pre-COVID-19 profitability levels, a 25% limit on the Corporation Tax losses forward that can be used in one year would likely not yield significant additional tax, due to the amounts of losses forward available to the relevant companies.  </p><p>A five-year restriction on the carry forward of losses, if applied in respect of losses incurred to date, could mean that these companies are no longer able to use the historic losses that are being carried forward since the financial crisis. The likely additional tax yield from such a measure would depend on future profitability levels of the banks and it is not possible to estimate this accurately at present. It is further noted that, if losses forward are restricted in this manner, future profitability is likely to be offset to some extent by current losses arising during the pandemic.</p><p>The Deputy may recall that in 2018, Department of Finance officials produced a detailed technical note for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the subject of both bank losses and corporation tax losses more generally (see <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/436ff7-technical-note-on-the-potential-consequences-of-changes-to-the-treat/).  </i>It was further updated and re-circulated to members during the 2019 Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

Authorisations are then valid for the entire EU, under the principle of single authorisation. Passporting of services and activities is made possible as the standard of regulation and supervision of passporting firms is effectively the same throughout the EU. The Central Bank is notified in advance by the Home Country Supervisor of the activities which will be conducted. However, supervisory responsibility remains with the Home Country Supervisor.</p><p>It is a matter for each individual institution authorised elsewhere in EEA whether it chooses to passport its services into Ireland or not.</p><p>Banks from non EU countries can operate within the EU in two different ways. They can establish a subsidiary in an EU country and then passport across the EU like other Banks or they can to open &lsquo;third country branches&rsquo; in the EU countries where they wish to operate. There is limited harmonisation of rules on third country branches on an EU level and it is usually the case that third country branches are confined to the member states where they are established. </p><p>Any firm operating in Ireland under EU passporting rules must use a regulatory disclosure statement, indicating the EU country where it has been authorised but highlighting that it is regulated in Ireland for conduct of business rules. In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that SME borrowers in Ireland have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. </p><p>The SME Regulations, <i>centralbank.ie/news/article/regulations-for-firms-lending-to-smes-from-2016</i>, set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. </p></reply>

Income chargeable under Case V is computed on the gross amount of rent receivable less allowable expenses incurred in earning that rent, as specified in section 97(2). These expenses include, inter alia, the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance, and management of the premises borne by the person chargeable and which constitute an expense of the agreement under which the rent/receipts were received, but excluding any capital expenditure.   </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s Tax and Duty manual 04-08-01 provides detailed guidance on the tax treatment of rental income.  Service charges and levies that are imposed by management companies are deductible against the landlord&rsquo;s rental profits.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it does not have a figure for the cost of deductions claimed by landlords for service charges or levies related to the remediation of defects, as it does not request such detailed information on tax returns.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are exempt from income tax and are not subject to corporation tax, and approved housing bodies that have charitable status would benefit from the charitable tax exemption, and therefore tax deductibility of service charges would not be relevant to such entities. </p>  <p>  I have no plans at present to extend to other apartment and duplex owners the facility to write off service charges and remediation levies against tax liabilities as mentioned in the Deputy's question.</p></reply>

However, before introducing such a tax it is of course vital to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long term vacant properties, and the reasons why they are vacant. This is why the recently announced strategy, &lsquo;Housing For All&rsquo; states that my Department will collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a Vacant Property Tax.</p>  <p>  The recently enacted Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enables Revenue to collect certain limited information on vacant properties in the LPT return form it will issue to property owners in advance of the new LPT valuation date of 1 November next. This information, together with information from other available sources will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax. </p>  <p>   While it is the clear intention of Government to introduce a Vacant Property Tax, the matter needs extensive consideration for such a measure to be effective and to determine the properties that should be targeted. Once this information has been collated, we will be in a better position to assess the merits and precise design of a Vacant Property Tax. </p>  <p>   It is important to identify the reasons for vacancy and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate. Appropriate exemptions from any charge would have to be considered in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy. </p>  <p>   As part of 'Housing for All' strategy, the Government has committed to a range of actions as part of the pathway to address vacancy and ensure the efficient use of housing stock.   In the context of the development of &lsquo;Housing For All&rsquo; my Department had intensive engagement with relevant Departments including the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I engaged similarly with ministerial colleagues including of course the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I expect engagement in relation to the specific issue of vacant residential property taxation will intensify once data on vacancy from LPT returns are available and analysed.</p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works &euro;1 billion flood relief investment programme nationally, from which the relevant funding for the Enniscorthy scheme will be made available, and on completion will protect 236 properties in the town.</p>  <p>  The Scheme requires formal confirmation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER) to proceed. This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts(ADA), which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme. This involves, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) commissioned by WCC and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to MPER as part of the formal Confirmation process.</p>  <p>  DPER ran the statutory public consultation period required in relation to this process from July 28th to August 28th, 2020. The initial phase of the review of the EIAR and NIS was carried out by consultants engaged for this purpose by DPER, during September and early October. DPER subsequently forwarded submissions from the public consultation, and the EIAR and NIS reviews, to the OPW, along with a request for supplementary information, pursuant to ADA regulations 2019, to ensure that the design of the scheme complies with relevant environmental directives and regulations. </p>  <p>  The OPW, Wexford County Council, and scheme consultants Mott Mc Donald formally submitted their response to DPER in the final week of April 2021.  DPER confirmed that they have received the independent consultants&rsquo; review of this information and are finalising their assessment of the supplementary information. </p>  <p>  Completion of the above tasks and the progression of the flood relief scheme is a priority for all parties. In parallel with the confirmation process, OPW and Wexford County Council have been working on the following to ensure as efficient progression of the works as possible once the scheme is confirmed &ndash;   </p>  <p>  - Foreshore Licence Application public consultation has been completed, documentation is under review by the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage , and approval is expected 2021. </p>  <p>  - Technical approvals have been received from Irish Rail for the railway line crossings and from Irish Water for the diversion of services, the legal agreements with Irish Rail and Irish Water are complete, and will be signed post confirmation. </p>  <p>  - Tender Pre-qualification for contractors for the bridgeworks was re-advertised and is currently being assessed. This will expedite contractor appointment post-confirmation.  </p>  <p>  - Service Diversions - the detailed design &amp;amp; tender documents for these works are complete, the tender for these works will be advertised following scheme confirmation. </p>  <p>  - Archaeological excavations are ongoing. </p>  <p>  - Treatment of invasive species (e.g. Japanese Knotweed) is ongoing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-28a.635.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092800075#WRM03400"><p>I thank the Deputy for her interest in the PEACE PLUS programme. I am pleased to be able to report that this ambitious new North South EU-funded programme is now in the final stages of development.</p><p>PEACE PLUS was first proposed by the European Commission in 2018 as part of its package of measures for the Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) and Cohesion Policy for the 2021-27 period. This proposal was and remains a clear demonstration of the importance placed by the EU, and by the Irish and UK Governments, of ensuring continued investment for peace, prosperity and cross-border cooperation, in support of the Good Friday Agreement. </p><p>PEACE PLUS will cover an eligible area of Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland (i.e. Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo). It will replace the current PEACE and INTERREG cross-border EU programmes by combining these two funding streams into one cohesive new North South programme for 2021-27. </p><p>The cross-border Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) has been leading the development of PEACE PLUS, working in close cooperation with my Department and with the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland. The SEUPB has been assisted in this development task by a cross-sectoral Programme Development Steering Group (PDSG). This steering group consists of representatives of central and local government, environmental, rural, voluntary, community, equality, business and trade union groups from both Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p><p>The development of PEACE PLUS has also been shaped by extensive stakeholder engagement. This has included two major public consultation exercises, which saw events held in every county of the eligible area for the new programme, as well as the collection of several hundred written submissions. There has also been close engagement between Government Departments North and South in order to agree and develop areas of cross-border collaboration under the new programme.</p><p>On foot of this considerable preparatory work, the SEUPB has finalised a draft PEACE PLUS programme based on six thematic investment areas:  </p><p>- Building Peaceful and Thriving Communities; </p><p>- Delivering Economic Regeneration and Transformation; </p><p>- Empowering and Investing in Young People; </p><p>- Healthy and Inclusive Communities; </p><p>- Supporting a Sustainable and Better Connected Future; </p><p>- Building and Embedding Partnership and Collaboration.</p><p>Details of the investment themes are available in the Consultation Information Document on the SEUPB's PEACE PLUS website, and I encourage anyone with an interest in the new programme to visit to learn more.</p><p>PEACE PLUS has an anticipated total budget of over &euro;1 billion. This is around twice the value of the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes combined, and demonstrates the scale and ambition of the new programme. This cross-border investment is more important than ever, in the context both of the challenges of Brexit and recovery from the pandemic. </p><p>I look forward to bringing the draft PEACE PLUS programme to Government for approval shortly. The draft programme will subsequently be submitted to the European Commission for final consideration and approval. This will allow for a formal launch of PEACE PLUS during 2022, with the first funding approvals taking place later that year. </p></reply>

This investment is to underpin the delivery of the existing capital flood relief programme and the additional flood relief schemes recommended in the Flood Risk Management Plans. These plans set out the proposed measures, including physical flood defence works / schemes, to address the significant flood risks identified, in a comprehensive and sustainable way. The proposed measures take into account the potential impacts of climate change, and address the need to assess and mitigate environmental impacts. The plans include a number of schemes in the coastal areas of Fingal, Dublin City and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and updates on these schemes are detailed below. </p><p>The Local Authorities work closely with the OPW as the Approving Authority to manage flood risk. Each scheme will be subject to an assessment of adaptability for future climate change within its particular context, and, as appropriate, provisions will be made in the design and construction of the schemes to cater for potential future changes. The Brief for the detailed development of the schemes includes a requirement for a Scheme Adaptation Plan, which will set out how climate change has been taken into account during the design and construction, and what adaptation or alternate measures might be needed into the future.</p><p>The Government has also established an Inter-Departmental Group on Managing Coastal Change to scope out an approach for the development of a national co-ordinated and integrated strategy to manage the projected impact of coastal change to our coastal communities, economies, heritage, culture and environment.  The Inter-Departmental Group is jointly chaired by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the OPW and will bring forward options and recommendations for the Government to consider.</p><p><b>Dublin City  </b></p><p>Dodder (tidal)</p><p>As part of the Dodder River (Tidal) Flood Alleviation Scheme, the flood defence works downstream of Ballsbridge are complete and provide a 100-year standard of protection for the fluvial scenario and a 200-year standard for tidal events including freeboard.</p><p>South Campshires:</p><p>The South Campshires Flood Protection Project primarily provides flood protection to the South inner city of Dublin from Georges Quay to approximately 50m east of the Samuel Beckett Bridge. The project is now substantially complete following work by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and Dublin City Council (DCC).</p><p>Sandymount:</p><p>Consultants were engaged in 2021to carry out further work on wave overtopping on the promenade and advise on rock armour sizes for the promenade. </p><p>Clontarf:</p><p>A number of environmental and topographical surveys have been carried out. The existing sea wall has been drone-surveyed and a structural/leachate survey of the wall has also been carried out. A decision on the flood-wall line is awaited.  </p><p>A public communications plan is being put in place by the area office and a steering group meeting is to take place with the local councillors in October.</p><p><b>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown</b></p><p>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council are currently working closely with the OPW to manage flood risk on three main river catchments in the County. These river catchments are:</p><p>Loughlinstown where a Consultant has been appointed and early design work has already commenced in this Catchment</p><p>Carysfort-Maretimo and Old Connacht/Wilford, which will both be addressed in the next phase of the FRMP implementation.</p><p><b>Fingal</b></p><p>In some cases, CFRAM identified that technically viable flood relief schemes for certain communities would not be economically, viable based on the level of assessment of the CFRAM Studies. In such cases a Scheme Viability Review (SVR) will be undertaken to review and confirm the likely viability of a scheme for the community.</p><p>OPW are responsible for procuring a Scheme Viability Review to review and confirm the likely viability of a scheme for the following locations; Skerries, Rush, Malahide &amp;amp; Portmarnock. </p><p>Sutton / Howth North</p><p>Assessments of the Sutton/Baldoyle area as part of CFRAM Programme confirmed that the progression of the impacts of climate change will be slow and will evolve over a prolonged period.  The &lsquo;Sutton &amp;amp; Howth North&rsquo; area has been retained as an Area for Further Assessment under the second cycle of the EU Flood Directive, which is required to consider and plan for the potential impacts of climate change. Based on that, flood protection measures will be assessed and, where viable, implemented in staged process as the impacts of climate change develop. </p></reply>

Legal formalities in relation to this grant have not yet been finalised as the Chief State Solicitor's Office is still awaiting documentation from the grantee's solicitor. I understand the latest request for documentation was issued by the CSSO on 26 July.  My officials are available to meet the grantee if that is considered helpful and the club can contact the Sports Capital Division of my Department directly in this regard.

Through this capital investment programme, F&aacute;ilte Ireland targets specific &lsquo;platforms&rsquo; upon which it can develop and enhance visitor attractions of scale that have the greatest potential to grow tourism across Ireland throughout the year.</p>  <p>  To date there have been calls for grant applications on two distinct platforms.  The first call for applications in 2019 focused on the platform of immersive heritage and cultural attractions and invited proposals for large-scale projects of &euro;2.5 million upwards.  Upon completion of the assessment process, funding totalling over &euro;44 million was awarded for the development of four new world-class tourist attractions in Cavan, Donegal, Mayo and Dublin.  For the second platform, launched in January 2020 and involving a targeted call for applications from local authorities, funding of &euro;19 million has been awarded for the development of word-class activity facility centres at 22 waterside locations across the country where water-based activities are a key visitor attraction.  Further focused calls on other platforms will follow in due course.</p>  <p>  Details of the funding allocations provided by my Department to F&aacute;ilte Ireland are published in the annual Revised Estimates Volume issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's overall capital allocation for 2022 will be confirmed in the 2022 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) for Public Services.</p></reply>

These limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In reviewing the rent limits, my Department worked closely with DSP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases.</p>  <p>  Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.  The current maximum HAP rent limits are available on the Irish Statute Book website at the following link:</p>  <p>www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/56/made/en/print?q=housing&amp;years=2017</p>  <p>  Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case. </p>  <p>  In considering this issue, I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p>  <p>  My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. It is considered that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally adequate to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review. Under Housing for All, my Department will undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.</p></reply>

In general, affordable purchase schemes under the plan will be targeted at first time buyers.  However, it is intended that a &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle will apply for applications to both affordable purchase housing and local authority home loan schemes. This would mean that people who are divorced or who have undergone insolvency proceedings, will be eligible to apply.</p>  <p>  Housing for All commits to delivering an average of 4,000 affordable purchase homes per annum.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, I have already commenced Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 regarding Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements. Section 10 of that Act details criteria for the assessment of applicant eligibility by a housing authority and provides eligibility in cases where a marriage, civil partnership or relationship has ended.  It is intended the Regulations governing the operation of these provisions will be put in place in the near future.</p>  <p>  With regard to Cost Rental affordable homes, the first set of Regulations under the Affordable Housing Act 2021 came into effect on 19 August, and these govern the process by which the owners of dwellings may obtain the designation of their properties as Cost Rental dwellings. With the relevant elements of the Act relating to the local authority affordable purchase scheme (Part 2) and Cost Rental (Part 3) now commenced, it is my intention to make further Regulations governing eligibility and price ceilings that will be applicable to these schemes by November 2021. These regulations will also reflect the &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle.</p>  <p>  Finally, the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021, will also apply this 'Fresh start' principle. The &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; definition will come into effect with the other changes under the Local Authority Home Loan Scheme later in Q4 this year, when the new Regulations and revised Credit Policy are in place.   </p></reply>

It is a strategic framework used to identify deficiencies across the whole water supply system, and to develop plans and programmes to address them through capital investment, demand management and improved operation of facilities and distribution networks. The NWRP consists of the published Framework Plan and the development of the four Regional Water Resources Plans (RWRPs), which Irish Water is currently developing, to identify the combination of preferred approaches within and between regions to address the needs identified in the Framework Plan.</p>  <p>  Under the Water Services Act 2013, Irish Water is required to seek the consent of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage given with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to enter into capital commitments. Irish Water must seek Ministerial consent prior to entering into any individual capital commitment of a value in excess of &euro;20m. This is a financial control and not a project consent and consideration must also being given to the appropriate application of the Public Spending Code for evaluating, planning and managing the public investment in the project as it proceeds through its lifecycle.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that Irish Water will be submitting a Preliminary Business Case during 2022, including an update to the preliminary cost estimate, to inform the Government's Decision at Gate 1 - Approval in Principle to the Project. The Government&rsquo;s consideration will also be informed by an independent external review of the Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities also to be undertaken in 2022 having regard to Irish Water&rsquo;s Preliminary Business Case including the National Water Resource Plan and its associated Regional Water Resource Plans.  </p>  <p>  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

The next census is now due to take place on 3 April 2022.  Reviews of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies are linked to the publication of Census of Population data.  In practical terms, the publication of preliminary census results triggers the establishment of a Constituency Commission under section 5(1) of the Electoral Act 1997 with the Commission required to present its report on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies to the chairman of the D&aacute;il within three months of publication of final census results.</p>  <p>  The timing for the publication of both preliminary census results and final census results are matters for the CSO but typically have taken place within approximately 3 months and 12 months respectively of the holding of the census.  The next review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies will commence following the publication of preliminary census results and will be completed in accordance with the statutory timeframe.</p>  <p>Notwithstanding the above, in January of this year, I published the General Scheme of the Electoral Reform Bill. The general scheme addresses a number of commitments in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future including the commitment to establish a statutory Electoral Commission.  The general scheme has been published on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/34cf6-general-scheme-of-the-electoral-reform-bill-2020/.</p>  <p>  The Electoral Commission will be independent of Government and will report directly to the Oireachtas.  Following its establishment, it will, among other matters, take on several existing statutory electoral functions from the outset, including the work currently undertaken by Constituency Commissions.   </p></reply>

In accordance with Article 29 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), any person or body, on payment of the prescribed fee, may make a submission or observation in writing to a planning authority in relation to a planning application within the period of 5 weeks beginning on the date of receipt by the authority of the application. </p>  <p>  Under Section 37 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act) an applicant for permission and any person who made submissions or observations in writing in relation to the planning application to the planning authority in accordance with the permission regulations and on payment of the appropriate fee, may, at any time before the expiration of the appropriate period, appeal to the Board against a decision of a planning authority under section 34 of the Act. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Courts to decide whether to grant leave for Judicial Review in planning cases in accordance with sections 50 and 50A of the Act. While respecting the system of public participation, the Government is planning legislative change to reform judicial review in the planning domain, and also introduce and establish a new division of the High Court to deal with planning and environmental cases.  In addition, the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All Plan has committed to a review of planning legislation to ensure it is more accessible and streamlined.  These reforms, together with increasing digitalisation, will improve the functioning of the planning regime. </p></reply>

This led to undesirable situations where, for example, some residents were living in partially completed housing developments.</p>  <p>  Local Property Tax (LPT) exemptions in respect of certain unfinished housing developments were applied to those developments listed in the schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 91 of 2013). These developments were exempted on the basis of a 2012 survey to identify developments that were in a seriously problematic condition.</p>  <p>  My Department notified all local authorities of the details of the approach to the waiver in early February 2013. My Department asked all authorities to re-examine their classifications to ensure their continued accuracy. My Department also held a seminar on the waiver for local authorities on Unfinished Housing Developments at which the rationale for the approach to the waiver was further explained.</p>  <p>The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities, utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey. Only developments (and parts of developments) that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.  These Regulations applied to 421 developments, which remain exempt from LPT.  The qualifying conditions are set out in detail on the LPT portal at: www.revenue.ie and are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  </p>  <p>  The list was compiled and signed off on by each individual local authority in the knowledge that only those developments listed would qualify for the waiver. There is no appeal or review mechanism built into the application of the waiver.  There is therefore no scope to add to the list of unfinished estates.  With regard to new incomplete estates, it is a matter for local authorities to assess the best options for resolution of developments that are to be taken in charge. </p>  <p>  It is of note that new properties purchased from a builder or developer between 1 January 2013 and 31 October 2021 are exempt from Local Property Tax (LPT) until the end of 2021.   </p></reply>

The meetings to date have been very useful in allowing for issues relating to coastal change management to be reflected upon and explored in the context of the particular operations of the participating organisations.</p>  <p>  The findings of the group are currently being compiled into a report which will be presented to Government later this year.    </p></reply>

A management plan scoping exercise was undertaken by ESB International on behalf of the ESB in 2016/2017. The NPWS took part in the stakeholder group that contributed to the report produced as a result of that exercise. </p>  <p>  Under the Habitats Directive, Ireland is obliged to report to the EU on the conservation status of all habitats and species of European Community interest, as listed in Annexes to the Directive. Monitoring of SACs are carried out by the NPWS on a cyclical basis. The most recent report was submitted to the EU in 2019 and is available on the NPWS website. </p>  <p>  The priority habitat &ldquo;Alluvial forests with Alder and Ash&rdquo; is one of the qualifying interests of the Gearagh SAC and a monitoring site for this habitat is located within the SAC. It was most recently surveyed during the 2017-2018 monitoring period, when the area, structure and functions, and future prospects of the habitat in SAC were all assessed as favourable. This is in contrast with the national conservation status of the Alluvial forests habitat in Ireland, which is considered to be bad, and deteriorating. </p>  <p>  The Gearagh SAC is also listed for the habitat &ldquo;Rivers with muddy banks&rdquo;. In addition to the NPWS survey, results of a 2018 botanical survey were made available to the NPWS by the ESB. The habitat was assessed as favourable in the Gearagh SAC. </p>  <p>  The NPWS continues to engage with the ESB on the monitoring of this site.

The detailed administration of this Scheme including assessment, approval and prioritisation is the responsibility of local authorities. </p>  <p>  My Department's approach every year is to issue a single full year allocation to each local authority, so they can plan, prioritise and implement the programme. Over the course of the year, my Department works closely with the local authorities to monitor spend and to achieve a full drawdown of the available funding. This means that if underspends arise on the part of some local authorities, they can be redistributed to other authorities. If a local authority is dealing with a high level of applications, further additional funding can be requested from my Department and every effort will be made to accede to any such request.  </p></reply>

The Department of Housing played a key part in helping to develop the National Student Accommodation Strategy in 2017 the production of which was an action under Rebuilding Ireland.  The strategy was published by the then Department of Education and Science and includes eight key targets and 27 actions to support the delivery of an increased level of supply of Student Accommodation. </p>  <p>  The two Departments also worked in close co-operation in passing the Residential Tenancies Act 2018. That Act contained provisions designed to improve protections and affordability measures for students residing in student-specific accommodation. </p>  <p>  I believe that Housing for All : A New Housing Plan for Ireland will transform every aspect of our housing including the area of student accommodation. The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. Crucially Housing for All takes a genuine whole of Government approach to creating a long-term, sustainable housing system for Ireland. I am confident that the breadth of measures and reforms therein will remove impediments to progress and provide for the delivery of much needed additional accommodation at scale. This will prove to be of benefit to all those seeking safe, affordable and secure accommodation including our growing student population. </p>  <p>  Specifically, Housing for All contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists, through access to appropriate financing, and a specific action in relation to legislating to allow for Technological Universities to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency. My Department is already working closely with DFHERIS to deliver on this commitment and I expect top see progress in the near future. I know that The Technological University Dublin &ndash; the largest higher education institution in the State &ndash; has identified a student accommodation requirement and proposal and there is similar potential to do so amongst other technological universities. Existing more established Universities have already availed of this loan facility to the tune of &euro;170 million over the past 2-3 years to aim to deliver more than 1,400 additional student specific units.</p></reply>

This is set out in the regulations governing the Scheme and ensures the effective targeting of limited resources. </p><p>Applicants who are separated or divorced may be treated as first-time buyers, in accordance with the regulations, if they meet certain conditions, including: </p><p>- they are separated or divorced under a court order or by a separation agreement;</p><p>- the property being purchased is the first property since leaving the family home;</p><p>- they have left the family home and retain no interest in it; or</p><p>- the other party has remained in the family home.</p><p>In meeting the conditions as set out above, in particular that the other party has remained in the family home and that the potential applicant has relinquished any rights they had over that property, no financial gain should have been made by the potential applicant in exchange for relinquishing their rights to the property in this manner. Were the individual to have made a financial gain in releasing their rights to the property, such as being bought out by the other party who remains resident in it, they would be deemed to have been compensated for their interest in the property, and therefore not be eligible as a first-time buyer.</p><p>The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis. Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authorities.</p><p>As part of Housing for All, a &lsquo;Fresh start&rsquo; principle will apply to applications to State-run affordable housing and loan schemes in future. This means that people who are divorced/separated and no longer have a financial interest in the family home, or who have undergone insolvency proceedings, will be eligible to apply for State loan schemes. </p><p>Therefore, the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, the 'Local Authority Home Loan', will apply this 'Fresh start' principle.  I look forward to announcing further details in respect of the Local Authority Home Loan in the coming months.</p></reply>

The Bathing Water Expert Group is currently developing terms of reference for an assessment of the different options to ensure all relevant measures are considered.</p>  <p>  The EPA as the environmental regulator makes sure that local authorities carry out their functions under the Bathing Water Regulations to monitor bathing waters, to warn of pollution events and to take action where there are water quality issues. The EPA share the latest information provided by local authorities with the public through www.beaches.ie.  I would encourage all bathers to use the information on this dedicated website before going swimming, and to always follow the advice of the HSE and Department of Health in relation to social distancing protocols when at the beach.</p>  <p>  The Bathing Water Regulations 2008 (as amended), transpose the requirements of the 2006 Bathing Water Directive (BWD) into national legislation. These regulations set the framework for the effective management of bathing waters around the country. The regulations also aim to improve health protection for bathers and ensure adequate information is disseminated in a timely manner during the bathing season.</p>  <p>  Currently in Ireland there are almost 150 designated bathing waters identified by local authorities with the help of public consultation.  The water quality in these areas is monitored during the bathing season. The regulations define the bathing season to mean the period from 1st June to 15th September in any calendar year and also set out the sampling and monitoring requirements for all designated bathing waters.</p>  <p>  The bathing water report for 2020, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), states that 96% of bathing waters met or exceeded the minimum required standard. This is up from 95% in 2019 and improvements in bathing water quality are welcome and necessary.    </p></reply>

This measure significantly reduced the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. The linkage with HICP aims to safeguard continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords to deliver the much needed supply of high-quality rental accommodation while protecting against a significant increase in rental inflation in the coming years.</p>  <p>  When introducing these measures, I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified. The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 also provides that an index, other than HICP, may be prescribed for the purposes of restricting rent increases in RPZs. Given the continuing rise in HICP inflation, up to 3% p.a. in August, I will consider all the legal options available to me to ensure that effective rent controls are legally in force in RPZs to cap the rate of any rent increase where the general inflation rate is too high.  Any necessary provision relating to rent control in RPZs will be considered in the context of the impending Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently examining this matter and the advices of the Office of the Attorney General will inform any changes in this area. </p></reply>

The annual targets are for the delivery of a total of 88,400 new build social homes, 53,800 new affordable homes and 170,000 private homes in the period 2022-2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency (LDA) and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>   Details on social housing delivery for each local authority, across a range of delivery mechanisms, are included in social housing statistics published by my Department. This data is available to the end of Quarter 2 2021 and is available on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/  </p>  <p>A detailed Social Housing Construction Status Report is also published each quarter which provides scheme level detail on new build activity. The most recent publication covers the period up to the end of Quarter 2 2021 and is available on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7709-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q2-2021/.  This data includes information for each local authority and includes a list of the individual projects that make up the new build programme for that local authority.</p>  <p>My Department also publishes data on Commencement Notice statistics. A Commencement Notice is required to give notice to Building Control Authorities of the erection of buildings, or classes of buildings, or the carrying out of works, or classes of works, as may be specified in the regulations.

The implementation of Housing for All has already begun. There are 213 objectives in this plan, all of which will be delivered according to the dates outlined in the plan itself. The first progress report on Q3 2021 actions is currently being prepared for publication.</p>  <p>  Not only will there be oversight and direction at the highest level through the Cabinet Committee on Housing (chaired by the Taoiseach), and the Secretary General Delivery Group (chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach), there will also be dedicated Workstreams, led by the relevant Secretaries General, on i) investment, ii) industry capability, and iii) public service delivery. These Workstreams are tasked with drilling down into the priority actions, to identify any blockages, take appropriate action, and ensure a rigorous monitoring system is in place to ensure delivery. </p>  <p>  To keep us on track, the actions in Housing for All will be updated on an annual basis, including timelines, to sustain momentum on delivery during the lifetime of the Plan.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is a radical plan that sets out four pathways to a sustainable housing system. Affordability and the chance to own a home is at the heart of this government&rsquo;s housing policy. It recognises that significant new supports are needed so that those who want to own their own home can do so, and that those who wish to rent are able to do so at an affordable rate. Pathway 1 &lsquo;Supporting homeownership and increasing affordability ' addresses this issue and sets out a number of key actions in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The objective is to supply 300,000 new homes by 2030, meaning an annual average of at least 33,000 homes per year. This includes an average of 10,000 social homes and 6,000 affordable homes made available each year for purchase or rent up to 2030. This will have a dramatic impact on the provision of housing and will significantly help facilitate house buyers. </p>  <p>  Specifically, regarding middle-income families wishing to buy homes, Housing for All contains a multi-pronged approach to supply and improving affordability.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Home Loan will be expanded, extending its reach and impact, particularly for single people. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy incentive is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes.</p>  <p>  In addition, new higher-rate stamp duty measures and planning permission restrictions have been introduced that will minimise the bulk buying of traditional family homes. I also plan to introduce a new form of &lsquo;Owner-Occupier Guarantee&rsquo; which will enable Local Authorities to specify a minimum proportion of the houses in a new development for owner occupiers. </p>  <p>  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund will stimulate the activation of some apartment developments for sale to individual purchasers. The Land Development Agency (LDA), through Project Tosaigh, will intervene in slow or stalled developments with landowners in order to unlock and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the LDA and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. There is a targeted approach right across the country to supply housing where it is needed most. This is supported by updated planning guidance, additional State land provided for housing, and an increase in funding for Local authorities to acquire new land so that they can deliver social and affordable homes at scale. All of this will help create the environment needed to deliver on the objectives in Housing for All.</p>  <p>  I am mindful however that projections for delivery will be heavily influenced by COVID-19 related uncertainties in the earlier years of the Plan. These uncertainties will reduce over time as the impact of the pandemic on the housing backlog is fully established and associated construction related constraints diminish. However, ongoing uncertainties associated with raw material costs and availability, and the sector&rsquo;s capacity to recover, may also impact on delivery but I am confident that Housing for All and the breadth of measures and reforms therein will remove impediments to progress and provide for the much-needed delivery of homes at scale.</p></reply>

My Department reviews this data monthly, along with other market trends.    </p>  <p>  Housing supply has been impacted by Covid-19.  The periods of lockdown since early 2020 have reduced construction activity and placed limitations on the ability to conduct normal sales activity, and this has impacted on house prices. The considerable growth in household savings, related to the public health restrictions which reduced consumption, also seems likely to be contributing to recent price inflation. </p>  <p>  The ongoing removal of Covid restrictions will allow for a full reopening of the housing market.  CSO data also shows that new dwellings completions for Quarter 2 are increasing and the effects of the periods of lockdown are alleviating.  Data on planning permissions and commencements are also showing a significant increase over this period.  </p>  <p>  The full opening up of the housing market and construction activity, along with the increases in supply that will be delivered by the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All Plan, will ensure that housing market activity normalises, and supply increases to meet demand as the Plan is implemented. </p>  <p>  As a matter of course in the development of housing policy or schemes, account is taken of the intended or potential impacts of the measures under consideration. Furthermore, the governance approach set out in Housing for All, including the Housing for All Delivery Group and my Department will continuously monitor and prioritise delivery of the Plan having regarding to relevant market trends including impacts on house prices, where appropriate.    </p></reply>

Section 3.2.3 of the Guidelines suggests that in areas &ldquo;under major urban influence&rdquo;, planning authorities may define &ldquo;rural generated&rdquo; housing need for &ldquo;Persons who are an intrinsic part of the rural community&rdquo; and for &ldquo;Persons working full-time or part-time in rural areas&rdquo;.  </p><p>Since 2018, the National Planning Framework (NPF) is the national planning policy document providing overall strategic policy for the future development of Ireland through specific National Policy Objectives (NPOs) that aim to support the overall rural and small town pattern of development in Ireland and deliver strengthened and diversified rural communities.</p><p>NPO 15 of the NPF fully supports the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage the development of certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence, in order to avoid over-development of those areas.</p><p>NPO 15 is supplemented by NPO 19, which aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other.  NPF Policy NPO19 is aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.</p><p>Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared by my Department to ensure consistency with new requirements and legislation at national and EU level introduced in respect of areas related to rural housing such as environmental protection, the Gaeltacht and climate action. The new guidelines will ensure a more consistent approach between counties and alignment with NPF objectives, and will be published in draft before the end of 2021.  In the meantime, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies that enable planning applications to be considered and planning permission to be granted for houses in rural areas.</p><p>The data requested is not collated by my Department.  Planning statistics are compiled by each planning authority on an annual basis for collation and publication on my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link:</p><p><b><font color="#800080"> </font></b>www.gov.ie/en/service/9e4ee-get-planning-statistics/</p><p>The data collected relates to the total number of applications and decisions for all developments that require planning permission, broken down by year and planning authority.</p><p>In addition, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical office, compiles and makes available detailed data on a number of planning related issues including permissions granted and completions by development type and county.  Data is available at the following link on the CSO website: www.cso.ie/en/statistics/construction/planningpermissions/  </p><p>It is noteworthy that there is strong delivery of new homes in rural areas nationally in recent years &ndash; with more than 25,000 rural house planning permissions granted in last 5 years.  In the same period, more than 90% of that number of rural homes were built, comprising around one in three houses completed in Ireland between 2016 and 2020.</p></reply>

This will allow each Local Authority to determine the affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment. </p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p>  <p>  The detailed design of the First Home scheme is currently progressing, for the scheme&rsquo;s introduction in early 2022. Price ceilings for eligible homes will be confirmed in advance of the scheme&rsquo;s operation.  Regulations regarding income eligibility in respect of the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be put in place by November.   </p>  <p>  More broadly, the Housing for All Strategy delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum. </p>  <p>  At a national level, over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. These homes will be provided by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency (LDA), as well as through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks. </p>  <p>  The Housing for All strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL). This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing newly constructed homes.   </p></reply>

The most recent summary, conducted in November 2020, shows that 61,880 households were assessed as qualified for and being in need of social housing support. This represents a decrease of 6,813 households or 9.9% on the last assessment in June 2019. Since 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 61,880, a reduction of 32.4%. In relation to the question posed by the Deputy regarding the number of families that have in the year to date applied for local authority or special needs housing, information of this specific type is not held by my Department. </p><p>The summary report for 2020 includes information in a range of categories, including details on households with a specific accommodation requirement arising from a disability. A breakdown of the categories of disability is available in Figure 2.5 and Table A 1.5 of the report.  The report is available at the following link:  <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/970ea-summary-of-social-housing-assessments-2020-key-findings/</i>.</p><p>It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time snapshot of the demand for social housing support in each local authority area and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the housing waiting lists.</p><p>The Housing for All Strategy delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  Central to the Plan is a major expansion in the role of the State in providing affordable and social homes.  Overall we need to deliver an average of 33,000 new build homes each year out to 2030.  This includes an average of 10,000 new  social homes each year, 4,000 affordable purchase homes and 2,000 cost rental homes. Over 54,000 new affordable homes will be delivered by the end of 2030, including a projected 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.</p><p>The provisions of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 were commenced in August of this year.  The Act details provisions for the following measures: a new local authority led affordable purchase scheme; a new affordable purchase shared equity &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; scheme for the sale of homes in private development; and establishing Cost Rental as a new form of tenure. To date, the first homes delivered under Cost Rental have been managed by Approved Housing Bodies and data is not retained centrally on applications.  In terms of affordable purchase, it is intended that Regulations governing the application procedure for the local authority led scheme will be published by November.</p></reply>

The periods of lockdown since early 2020 have reduced construction activity and placed limitations on the ability to conduct normal sales activity, and this has impacted on house prices. The considerable growth in household savings, related to the public health restrictions which reduced consumption, also seems likely to be contributing to recent price inflation. </p>  <p>  The ongoing removal of Covid restrictions will allow for a full reopening of the housing market.  CSO data regarding new dwellings completions for Quarter 2 shows that the rate of completions is increasing and the effects of the periods of lockdown are abating.  Data on commencements are also showing a significant increase over this period.  </p>  <p>  The full opening up of the housing market and construction activity, along with the increases in supply that will be delivered by the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All Plan, will ensure that housing market activity normalises, and supply increases to meet demand as the Plan is implemented.  In particular, a range of measures are being implemented which will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  These will increase the supply of affordable homes through delivering affordable homes on local authority lands; cost rental; the 'first home' affordable purchase scheme; and expansion of Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% for social and affordable housing. </p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the previously established Help to Buy  and the Rebuilding Ireland Homeloan schemes which also support first time buyers.   </p></reply>

Project consideration stages include submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals; submission of design brief; selection of site; application for approval in principle; appointment of design consultants; submission of a preliminary design; planning application; submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans; and tender process and construction stage.</p>  <p>- In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money, taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally.</p></reply>

This enables the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in Dublin and in urban areas of high demand. LIHAF is designed to specifically address the issue of housing supply, a crucial factor in terms of moderating house prices. Infrastructure being funded under LIHAF includes access roads, distributor roads, link roads, road improvements, roundabouts, bridges and parks. </p>  <p>  LIHAF was not primarily intended as an affordable housing scheme, although it will enable the development of more affordable housing on sites. It is a scheme which funds the building of public infrastructure by local authorities. This infrastructure in turn unlocks associated sites for housing development quicker than would otherwise have occurred.  As such, my Department does not routinely retain information on size of dwellings which may be made available by private developers building homes on private lands.</p>  <p>  In 2017, grant agreements for 30 approved projects were signed between my Department and local authorities. One such project was at Cherrywood, Co. Dublin. Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council were approved grant funding for the construction of a new N11 junction 'Q' at Druid Glen Road, Druid's Glen Road (road only), Druid&rsquo;s Glen bridge - (short bridge structure traversing valley) and Druid's Glen Road (bridge feature).</p>  <p>  Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has advised that the total residential units over the entire build out of the Cherrywood SDZ is for c.7,000 homes. The total housing associated to the LIHAF grant agreement is for 2,000 homes, including 200 Part V and 100 affordable homes.

As famine-like conditions are reported, there is an urgent need for full humanitarian access, a negotiated ceasefire, and the commencement of political dialogue to find a resolution to the conflict: I wish the former Nigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo, who has been appointed AU High Representative for the Horn of Africa, well in his mediation efforts.</p>  <p>  I am alarmed by the conflict&rsquo;s impact on civilians, including harrowing reports of widespread and ongoing sexual violence, and other serious human rights violations and abuses.   It is vital that perpetrators be held to account.  In this regard, Ireland strongly supports the work underway by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), to investigate reported atrocities. The publication of their joint report on 1 November will be a crucial first step towards accountability.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to take the lead at the UN Security Council to ensure a focus on the situation in Tigray. Ireland spearheaded calls for the most recent open Council meeting on 26 August, where UN Secretary General Guterres underscored the severity of the humanitarian situation, and urged all parties to immediately end hostilities, and negotiate a lasting ceasefire. At that meeting, Ireland reiterated its call for an urgent end to the violence, full humanitarian access, accountability for atrocities, and for a political solution to the conflict.</p>  <p>  The Government also continues to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis.  There will be a further discussion on Ethiopia and Tigray at the Foreign Affairs Council in October, in which Minister Coveney will participate. Minister Coveney also continues to engage on the situation in Tigray with key interlocutors, including leaders in the region and the Africa Union (AU). On 15 September he met with the EU Special Representative on the Horn of Africa, Dr Annette Weber, to discuss options for addressing the conflict. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s continued priority will remain, as always, supporting the needs of the most vulnerable people in Ethiopia, including those affected by conflict in Tigray. Ireland, through the Irish Aid programme, has so far provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the humanitarian response in Tigray and the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, through trusted UN and NGO partners on the ground. On 7 July, I announced additional humanitarian funding of &euro;2.75m for Ethiopia, to address hunger and insecurity, including in Tigray.</p></reply>

As a result of well implemented safety protocols, our staff were able to assist citizens both at home and abroad who required passports for a range of emergency and urgent personal, business or legal reasons, or who had compelling humanitarian needs to travel. </p>  <p>  In the first four months of this year 3,000 urgent passports, were issued to citizens who had either urgent personal or humanitarian needs for a passport.  While schedules for urgent situations are not maintained, on a case by case basis, issued passports have been collected by citizens in person when the postal service was not an effective delivery option.</p>  <p>  The public offices of the Passport Service in Cork and in Mount Street have been closed in line with COVID-19 public health restrictions and the public have complied fully with those restrictions.  While the pandemic has massively disrupted Passport and other public services, I am pleased that so far this year we have managed to have multiple interactions with our citizens by phone and online, provided over 300,000 passports since 4 May while our emergency services have been maintained for those with a medical emergency or death of a family member abroad.   There was one security related incident this year which has been reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where people were removed from our premises to ensure the safety of staff.</p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that, in line with our continued scaling up of services, the Passport Office in Mount Street resumed its Urgent Appointment Service for renewal of Passports on Monday, 27 September 2021. The Urgent Appointment Service for renewal of passports will be available to people who unexpectedly require their passport renewed at short notice and opt for this fee based service to do so.</p>  <p>  Applicants are now able to book an appointment to attend the public passport office in Mount Street. Passport applicants who require a same day passport renewal can book appointments 3 days in advance. Applicants who require a four day renewal service can book appointments 3 weeks in advance. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service will continue to prioritise its emergency service for those who require a passport for a medical emergency or death of a family member abroad.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are engaging with the Department of Health to return these officers following the recent decision to discontinue the Mandatory Hotel Quarantine advice line. In addition, two officers from the Passport Service remain assigned to the Public Appointments Service to assist with recruitment efforts.</p>  <p>  At present, of the 519 staff working in the Passport Service in August 2021, less than one per cent were working from home on a full-time basis, as staff directly involved in customer service and the production of passports are required to work on site. </p></reply>

Civil Defence policy is set down by the Minister for Defence through the Civil Defence Branch of the Department of Defence  and Civil Defence services are delivered at local level by the relevant Local Authority. </p>  <p>  The 2015 White Paper on Defence states that it is the responsibility of each Local Authority to provide suitable accommodation for their Civil Defence Unit. Most Local Authorities have provided high quality accommodation for their Units. For example, I recently had the pleasure of opening a new headquarters for Clare Civil Defence in Ennis. I note that both Meath and Monaghan County Councils have recently completed major new building projects for their Civil Defence Units. The Department of Defence provided some funding for each of these projects and, subject to budgetary constraints, is willing to support similar projects in other local authority areas.</p>  <p>  I am aware that further improvements in accommodation for Civil Defence units are required in a small number of Local Authorities. Officials in the Department of Defence are in contact with a number of Local Authorities in this regard.  While the Department of Defence is willing to assist, the provision of suitable accommodation for Civil Defence Units is ultimately a matter for each Local Authority.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time for the 2021/22 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  In addition, all post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and who have applied and paid on time will be accommodated on school transport services. This arrangement is in place for current school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme.   </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and are offered seats where capacity exists after all eligible children have been catered for. </p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2021/2022 school year. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that to date some 104,900 pupils have been issued tickets for the School Transport Scheme.  This number is continuing to change as tickets continue to be allocated to pupils where capacity is available.  As such the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available.

A sub-group of the main Expert Group focussed exclusively on the issue of improving and monitoring ventilation in schools. </p><p>This report formed the based for the most recent updating of the ventilation guidance for schools and included recommendations in relation to strengthening the message about the importance of good ventilation and the use of CO<sub>2</sub>monitors.</p><p>The use of CO<sub>2</sub>monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas/rooms within a building may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with the impact that activities, outdoor weather and window openings have on levels of good ventilation within a room. This information can be used to inform strategies for improving ventilation. The portable units can facilitate measurements in a wide range of locations in schools.</p><p>My Department procured portable monitors that are currently being distributed to schools &ndash; between 2 and 20 at primary school level and between 20 and 35 at post-primary school level depending on school size, at an estimated overall cost of &euro;4 million. The monitors are portable, simple to use, and will give a digital reading. </p><p>Deliveries of CO<sub>2</sub>monitors to schools commenced in the third week of August. In total, it involves over 35,000 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors being distributed to primary and post-primary schools.  25,000 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors have been distributed to schools to date, meaning that CO<sub>2 </sub>monitors have been delivered to each school in the country. </p><p>A fault was detected with the LCD display unit in the CO<sub>2</sub>monitor in the last batch of 10,000 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors by the manufacturer. </p><p>The quality assurance process means that there are no similar concerns with any of the 25,000 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors that have already been distributed to schools.</p><p>For schools which have received a monitor which is not working as expected, this is unrelated with the above issue.  It is most likely in these very small number of cases that the monitor simply got damaged in transit.  In the case where a monitor provide to a schools is not operating as expected, the school should contact Lennox Laboratories who will arrange for a replacement monitor to be provided.</p><p>96% of primary schools (including all special schools) have received their full allocation of CO<sub>2 </sub>monitors.  10 CO<sub>2</sub>monitors have been provided to schools at post-primary level.  The remaining balance of CO<sub>2</sub>monitors is expected to be distributed in October. </p><p>In the interim, the Department has advised schools that if they wish, they can make arrangements directly for procuring the balance of their CO<sub>2</sub>monitors directly themselves, rather than via the current arrangements.</p><p>The Department is providing schools with a technical specification for the monitors, and schools may share these specifications with suppliers for guidance.  The cost incurred by a school in procuring the shortfall in CO<sub>2</sub>monitors locally can be recouped from the Department.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each local authority to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  My Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within the particular area and its ability to meet increased demand. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  While there are currently no plans to establish an additional school in Waterford, the requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review.</p>  <p>  Where it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required, a patronage identification process takes place. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies, including Educate Together, and prospective patrons.  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been in operation under my Department since 2018 and provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process. </p></reply>

Ireland has consistently argued that, given the well-known measurement issues with GDP due to globalisation effects, an alternative measure should be used. This is acknowledged in the methodological notes of the report which notes that in 2016 Ireland produced a modified estimate of the gross national income (GNI*) that was recommended by the Economic Statistics Review Group and which is designed to specifically exclude these effects. My Department's estimate indicates that education expenditure as a percentage of GNI was 5.4% in 2018, which would leave Ireland ranked twelfth out of 36 OECD countries using that indicator. </p>  <p>  An alternative measure of government commitment to education spending can be seen in Ireland's measure of public expenditure on education as a percentage of total public expenditure, which in 2018 stood at 12.6%, well above the OECD average which stood at 10.7%. Ireland was ranked tenth for this indicator in the OECD report. </p>  <p>  With regard to public investment in education it should be noted that in the Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future, this Government is committed to building a world class education system. </p>  <p>  Over recent budgets, additional resources have been made available to our schools, including through the delivery of thousands of extra teaching and Special Needs Assistant posts, increased capitation in schools, enhanced supports for school leadership and an improved staffing schedule in primary schools. This is in addition to the significant COVID-19 financial resources provided in 2020 and again in 2021 to allow schools to operate in accordance with the latest public health guidance. </p>  <p>  In the context of Budget 2022 we will continue to seek movement for Ireland's education system, aim to deliver on the commitments set out in the Programme for Government, to meet demographic and other pressures in the school sector and to support and sustain our schools, their staff and our students in the face of the ongoing significant challenges posed by COVID-19.  </p></reply>

The Scheme, which was developed in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, provides for ex gratia payments to be made to those who qualify to apply for the Scheme and who satisfy the criteria as set out in the Terms of Scheme.</p>  <p>  The ex gratia scheme was originally established in 2015 and was put in place to provide those, who had instituted legal proceedings against the State in respect of day school sexual abuse and subsequently discontinued those proceedings following rulings in the domestic courts, with an opportunity to apply for an ex gratia payment.  The Scheme was paused in 2019 following a report from retired High Court Judge Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill who, as Independent Assessor, reviewed a number of unsuccessful applications to the Scheme and was of the view that the criteria to qualify for a payment were too restrictive for this group of applicants.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to fulfilling its obligations in implementing the ECtHR ruling.  This means that the revised scheme is designed first and foremost to provide a remedy to those who had issued and discontinued their proceedings against the State prior to the ECtHR ruling in O'Keeffe v Ireland and who did not receive a payment under the 2015 Scheme.  However, the revised scheme goes beyond that group in that all others who issued civil proceedings against the State at a later date and up to 1 July 2021, whether they are still in being, were discontinued at any point, or who had settled with the State, may also apply for an award.  </p>  <p>  As well as broadening the scope of the Scheme, the type and nature of evidence that will be considered by the State Claims Agency in respect of individual applications (and as set out in the Terms of Scheme) broadens the means trough which an applicant can demonstrate that they fall within the terms of the ECtHR judgment.  To date the Scheme Administrator has received 44 applications for an award, of which 36 have been approved so far.  </p>  <p>  I am not aware of any legal challenge in respect of the revised ex gratia scheme and therefore am not in a position to comment in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Full details of the Terms of Scheme are available on www.gov.ie/en/service/90a42-revised-ex-gratia-scheme.  Contact details for my Department for those wishing to apply to the Scheme and who require clarification or further information are also provided.  </p></reply>

For the 2021/22 school year the staffing schedule is on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils.  This Budget improvement has resulted in the lowest pupil teacher ratio ever at primary school.   </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 16:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2020/21 school year.  This compares favourably with the OECD pupil teacher ratio which is 1:15. In the same period the staffing schedule improved from 28:1 to 25:1 for this school year. </p>  <p>  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 23.3 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes for this school year, and statistics on this will be published later in the year.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule which now stands at a new historical low will also help to ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary and post primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020/21 school year. This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in Budget 2019. The combined increases given in 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration will be achieved. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 capitation grant will also continue to be the mechanism through which further additional funding will be provided to cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, PPE requirements and enhanced cleaning supports. </p></reply>

These plans are based on the Government&rsquo;s Work Safely Protocol which reflects the most up to date public health advice for the workplace. They set out the range of measures required to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and provide clear and helpful guidance for the safe operation of school through prevention, early detection and control of Covid-19.  These plans are living documents and are updated as public health guidance is updated. The infection prevention and control measures in place in schools have worked very effectively to prevent and control Covid-19 in schools and remain in place for this school year.</p>  <p>  Policy related to Covid-19 tracing services is a matter for the Department of Health.</p>  <p>In line with recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team, which were accepted by the Minister for Health, from Monday 27   September, automatic contact tracing of asymptomatic close contacts in children aged over 3 months and less than 13 years, in schools will no longer take place. Children who are deemed to be close contacts outside of a household setting will not be routinely required to restrict their movements and be tested.  </p>  <p>  Cases and outbreaks in Special Educational Needs settings, and respite care should have a public health risk assessment (PHRA) which may still require children to be identified as close contacts in these settings, be referred for testing and have their movements restricted. Generally, the advice for those children who are close contacts in these settings will be to have one test (if possible) and if they are advised to restrict movements, it will be for 5 days.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to work with the HSE public health to support schools dealing with Covid-19.</p></reply>

Both my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science have been working on sharing responsibility and identifying appropriate actions for the 18 key recommendations. The key recommendations relating to inclusion will involve both Departments.</p>  <p>The Indecon report made eighteen recommendations under four themes: improvement in career guidance tools and career information, better engagement with enterprise, promotion of inclusion and enhanced governance structures.</p>  <p>Under the promotion of inclusion theme, the four key recommendations were:</p>  <p>Introduce a specific module on career guidance as part of training for teachers in special schools.</p>  <p>Provide access for special education and adult learners to the proposed enhanced central career support services, including information on labour market opportunities.</p>  <p>Provide additional specialised ongoing CPD supports for teachers in special schools and</p>  <p>Prioritise resource allocation, including guidance teachers for learners most in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  Preliminary work began last year to progress some of these areas but the public health pandemic caused disruption to the initial work plan. My officials have begun a series of meetings, both internally and with external partners such as the National Disability Authority, to discuss the inclusion recommendations and further explore ways to strengthen Guidance and career supports in the education system. As Guidance is a whole-school activity my Department will be considering ways to improve whole-school Guidance to promote even greater inclusion, which will involve looking at the current level of training for all  teachers as well as that of guidance counsellors.</p>  <p>  One of the first actions that my Department is undertaking is to explore the level of training, relating to supporting and guiding students with special education needs (SEN), that guidance counsellors and other teachers receive during their post-graduate Guidance and teacher training courses. My officials will be working with the Guidance course leaders to see if the current SEN/inclusion Guidance training modules can be strengthened,  which will include, but not be limited to, looking at the challenges that face students with sight loss. Added to this my Department will then be looking at the current SEN/inclusion training all teachers receive during their initial teacher training and post-qualification continuing professional development.</p></reply>

Equipment is provided under this scheme for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the school&rsquo;s existing IT provision.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for assistive technology support. </p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions. Professional reports (from psychologists or occupational therapists, for example) must be submitted by the school along with the application. These reports must have a recent and comprehensive professional assessment of the nature and extent of disability, and outline that the equipment is essential for the pupil to access the curriculum.</p>  <p>  Equipment is provided where medical and/or other professional reports outline that the degree of communicative disability is such that this equipment is essential to allow the pupil to access education and set out how the equipment will provide for this. </p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application and professional reports, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department&rsquo;s officials will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making such recommendations, as set out in Circular 0010/2013.  </p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the assistive technology scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>   Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are not provided for under the Assistive Technology scheme. Such equipment is normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Aids and Appliances Scheme.</p></reply>

In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p><p>The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>Where a board of management receive an application for admission and they make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal.

This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission.</p><p>If the parent has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, she or he may, but is not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission.  Where admission has been refused for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and the parent does not wish to seek a review by the board of management she or he may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p><p>Full details on the section 29 appeals processes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link below:</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed/</i></p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed/</i></p><p>In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), the Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency, is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

For the 2021/22 school year the staffing schedule is on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils.  This Budget improvement has resulted in the lowest pupil teacher ratio ever at primary school.   </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 16:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2020/21 school year.

Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 25 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  In addition, there has been a three point reduction in the retention schedule, which will assist schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts.   </p>  <p>  The staffing process contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  The staffing arrangements at primary level also include a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolments for the following September. </p>  <p>  At post-primary level, teachers are allocated at a ratio of 19:1 in the Free Education System and 23:1 to schools in the fee-charging sector and the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for post primary schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Post Primary Appeals Board.  Additionally, schools that project an increase in enrolment may apply for an additional teacher allocation and provisional approval is sanctioned in May pending official confirmation of enrolments in September.</p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching allocation, as outlined in Circular 0007/2019, (primary schools) and 0008/2019 (post primary schools) provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile and also encompasses the Language Support (EAL) allocation that schools were allocated in previous years.  Further temporary Language Support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support. </p>  <p>  The staffing arrangements for primary and post primary schools for the 2021/22 school year, as set out in Circular 0019/2021 (primary) and Circulars 0005/2021, 0006/2021 and 0007/2021 (post primary),  which are available on the Department website, provides details on the staffing appeal process.   </p></reply>

Analysis of the parental preferences expressed in each area surveyed indicated that there was sufficient parental demand to support changes in school patronage in 28 areas, including in Dungarvan. </p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school can be opened where a school building became, or was due to become available as a result of an amalgamation/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, including in the case of Dungarvan, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, my Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.</p>  <p>  To date, it has not been possible to secure a school property to facilitate a new school under the divesting process being established in Dungarvan. However, my Department is continuing its efforts in relation to identifying a suitable solution under the patronage divesting process. </p>  <p>  In parallel with the Divesting process, my Department is continuing to work with stakeholders to progress delivery of the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process which </p>  <p>  has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational schools across the country.  This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and/or closure model of the patronage divesting process.</p>  <p>  The initial identification phase of the process involved each of the 16 Education and Training Boards identifying an initial pilot area within their functional area where they considered there may be unmet oncoming demand for a multi-/non-denominational school and arranging for surveys of parents of pre-school children in these areas.  The Department has been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference (Catholic Bishops)  with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next Phase of the process. The identification phase work provides useful learning and is informing the development of the process.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process envisaged as part of the Reconfiguration process) to engage with their school patron on the matter. A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  A number of patronage changes have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 multi-denominational Community National Schools.  In addition, an Irish-medium gaelscoil has recently changed patronage from its Catholic patron to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta.  From September 2021, this school offers parents of junior infants the choice of undertaking an Ethics and Morality Program and, for parents who so chose, a Catholic programme is provided.  </p></reply>

This will bring the total number of special classes nationally to 2,118. The new classes provide 1,600 additional places, spread right throughout the country.</p><p>Two new special schools are also opening this year, one in Dublin and one in Cork.</p><p>Despite this unprecedented increase, I am very aware of the need for further specialist education places in a small number of areas, mainly concentrated in Dublin.</p><p>Currently, there are forty three special classes for students with autism attached to mainstream primary and post-primary schools in D&uacute;n Laoghaire. Eleven of these classes have opened in the past eighteen months, providing placements for 258 students in the area.  This also includes three Early Intervention classes. </p><p>I acknowledge that any delay in securing a suitable school placement can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>Delays can happen for a variety of reasons including, for example, assessment reports for children becoming available over the summer period while schools were closed. In other cases, parents may change their preference for a class placement and request that their child move from a mainstream class to a special class. </p><p>My Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have therefore put in place new planning structures and procedures to ensure sufficient places become available to meet local need. As new need emerges, there is a cohesive response available to ensure places become available in a timely and targeted way.</p><p>The willingness of school communities to open special classes is central to ensuring that every child can obtain a suitable placement.

My Department is currently working to examine the capacity of the schools in the area to meet this projected demand.</p><p>Where capacity issues arise it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors: </p> <blockquote> 	Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area;<br /><br />School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area;<br /><br />Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school, they are not available to all pupils; and <br /><br />External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area. </blockquote>  <p>Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in the Fingal area, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.

Therefore a report from a psychologist or other medical professional is no longer required.  </p>  <p>  The circular requires the school to demonstrate evidence of intervention and differentiated support for those students who struggle with literacy, as well as the current level of in-school testing on discrete tests of word reading, reading comprehension or spelling. This includes using evidence of needs over time. As part of this process, the school will administer discrete tests to identify the needs of the student. It is these test results which inform intervention and need for any additional support. </p>  <p>For pupils with significant literacy needs, such as those where there are concerns that literacy attainments remain, despite intervention, at/below the 10th percentile, the school will most likely be providing support through the Special Education Teacher. These teachers undertake assessment and identification of need as part of their problem solving approach and development of Student Support Plans detailed in the Continuum of Support model. The granting of an Irish exemption emerges from this process. Therefore the school will have evidence on an individual&rsquo;s Student Support file to support the application for an exemption from the study of Irish.

While this change only took effect in 2012, it had been signalled well in advance.  In 1993, "Developing the National Pension System - Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; was published, which recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 contributions, in recognition of the expansion of PRSI coverage over the decades.  The necessary legislation to effect this recommendation was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997, which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002 (5 years after its introduction into law), and rising to 520 from April 2012 (15 years after its introduction in law). </p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  Its terms of reference included consideration of how long-term carers could be accommodated in the pension system.  </p>  <p>  The Commission has now concluded its work and has submitted its final report to me.  The report itself is extremely detailed, running to several hundred pages, and covers a range of complex matters in relation to the Pensions system which will require very careful consideration.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if his/her spouse is a State pensioner and has significant household means, his/her most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on his/her personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The programme aims to improve a person&rsquo;s opportunities to return to the labour market. </p>  <p>  CE placements are intended to be temporary and subject to time limits.  This is to ensure the continued availability of places on CE schemes for a broad range of long-term unemployed candidates.  Those who are unemployed and in receipt of an eligible payment for 12 months or more may be eligible to participate on CE.</p>  <p>  In general, all CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  However, CE participants, working towards a major educational award, can seek to extend participation by up to two years to enable them to reach the required qualification standards.</p>  <p>  Those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for up to three years, while CE participants who are aged over 55 and commenced on CE prior to the introduction of the changes in 2017 continue to be eligible to stay on CE for six consecutive years.  </p>  <p>  CE participants over the age of 62 can participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age on the CE Service Support Stream (SSS), subject to certain criteria.  In total, 10% of CE placements are available under the service support stream and Department officials continue to encourage CE schemes to promote this facility.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to amend the eligibility criteria as suggested by the Deputy; any reduction in the eligibility period would reduce the number of employment support places available for persons who are facing the greatest difficulty in returning to employment, namely the long-term unemployed.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services while ensuring that places continue to be made available to those who are long term unemployed.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This phase involves the procurement of regional employment services for seven counties in the Midlands and North-West across four lots.  These counties do not have an existing local employment service and represent the first phase of an expansion of employment services.</p>  <p>  The funding approach for the new service awards approximately ninety percent of fees to providers when clients commence their engagement and agree their personal progression plan. The latter requires a tailored approach for each client and can contain progression towards employment, which may involve participation on relevant education, training or other programmes.    </p>  <p>  Phase two will take on board the learnings of the first phase and apply these to subsequent Requests for Tenders that will expand this model throughout the rest of the State, including County Kerry.  This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.</p>  <p>  The Department is in receipt of legal advice from the Attorney General's office that it must procure its employment services in an open and competitive manner in order to meet its legal obligations arising from EU and national procurement rules. </p>  <p>  I understand and appreciate the concerns in the sector at the changes to the Local Employment Service model. However, existing service providers with a strong track record and a willingness to cooperate with others in the sector, will be well-placed to submit high-quality tenders for the new services. The new model and its associated procurement process is accessible to the community and voluntary sectors, including through lower financial requirements and a significant emphasis on service quality.  Phase two will take on board the learnings from the phase one procurement. </p></reply>

It is not means tested.  </p>  <p>  One of the basic principles underpinning the Irish social insurance system is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  </p>  <p>  At present the State Pension (Contributory) can be calculated under two different methods known as the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) and the Yearly Average (YA) approach.  The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation.  Since April 2019 all new State Pension (Contributory)applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.  </p>  <p>  The Total Contributions Approach to calculation, introduced for pensioners reaching State Pension Age from September 2012, included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme.  It acknowledged, for the first time, home caring periods prior to 1994.  TCA provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those with a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits / homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Yearly Average method, in place since the introduction of the state pension in 1961, is a calculation where the number of reckonable weekly PRSI contributions are divided by the number of years between entering social insurance and state pension age.  Entitlement is then banded, with a YA of 48 or more required for a full rate pension.  The YA system measures the frequency rather than the number of contributions.  Since 6 April 1994, the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme has allowed up to 20 years spent as a homemaker to be disregarded when calculating the YA. </p>  <p>  There are a number of anomalies associated with the YA system.  Entitlement to a full pension can in some cases be achieved from as little as 10 years of social insurance contributions.  This can happen where there is a shorter timespan between first and last social insurance contributions, i.e., someone who enters insurable employment at age 55 and works until they are pension age has time to gain the requisite 520 contributions to qualify for pension, and will have a higher yearly average than someone who has gaps in their record although they may have started work at 16.  </p>  <p>  A key concept in the YA calculation is that the number of contributions are calculated from the date of entry into social insurance to the end of the last complete tax year prior to the person's 66th birthday - covering the full period of their time contributing to the social insurance system, regardless of the classes of PRSI paid over that period.</p>  <p>  Modified rate contributions are not reckonable for a full standard State Pension (Contributory). However, they are used when calculating entitlement to a mixed insurance pro-rata State Pension (Contributory). </p>  <p>  A mixed insurance pro rata state pension is a pro-rata pension, introduced in November 1991, which is based on a combination of full and modified rate contributions.  Prior to this, many persons who paid a mixture of full and modified rate social insurance contributions did not qualify for pension despite the fact that they paid full-rate contributions for part of their working lives.  These persons may now qualify for a pension based on the number of full-rate contributions as a proportion of their total contributions i.e. full and modified rate.</p>  <p>  There are also EU and Bilateral pro-rata State Pension Contributory pensions.  The pension is a pro-rata payment based on the proportion of Irish social insurance contributions to the total number of contributions paid and/or credited, that is, Irish and other insurance combined.</p>  <p>  Those who have not built up state pension contributory entitlements in other countries, which are not covered by these agreements, will have gaps in their PRSI record and, whatever the system in place, this could be expected to impact upon their ability to qualify for a maximum rate contributory pension.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  </p>  <p>  The Commission has now concluded its work and has submitted its final report to me.  The report itself is extremely detailed, running to several hundred pages, and covers a range of complex matters in relation to the Pensions system which will require very careful consideration.  I intend to bring the report to Government in the near future, after which it will be published.  The Government has committed to taking action having regards to the Commission's recommendations within 6 months. </p>  <p>  If a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if his/her spouse is a State pensioner and has significant household means, his/her most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on his/her personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;195 million in 2021. </p>  <p>  The full year additional cost of the measure proposed by the Deputy is estimated at over &euro;36 million, assuming no change in the number of recipient households or in the duration of the fuel season.</p>  <p>  While I fully understand that these are difficult times for many people, especially for the vulnerable and the elderly, any further economic measures, such as increasing the fuel allowance payment, can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government targeted one third of carbon tax revenues to boosting the incomes of the poorest in our society.  Based on ESRI research, three key DSP payments were targeted for increases in the budget as a result - the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance.  Accordingly, with effect from January 2021, I increased the Fuel Allowance by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks.</p>  <p>  Finally, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Participation on WPEP is entirely voluntary.  All participants are paid &euro;306 per week plus any social welfare increases for qualified adults and children.

Host organisation must confirm appropriate insurance and health and safety measures in place and accept the terms and conditions of the programme.  </p>  <p>  Each work placement published on JobsIreland is reviewed in advance to ensure that it provides sufficient information on the nature of the work experience and training being offered by the host. The provision of training to participants, is a pre-condition for host organisations to participate on the scheme.  Options include a new accredited QQI work placement module available to all WPEP participants and delivered by the Education and Training Boards at QQI levels 3, 4 and 5. Host organisations must also demonstrate that they can provide supervision and mentoring to participants. Where the above requirements are not satisfied the placement will not be approved or advertised on jobsireland.ie.  </p>  <p>  Host organisations and individual placements are approved in accordance with these stringent WPEP eligibility criteria  and not for any other reason. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Illness Benefit is a short term scheme and is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of Invalidity Pension (IP) or Illness Benefit (IB), the latter for a minimum of 26 weeks, who wish to enter or re-enter employment or self-employment can apply for the Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) scheme. </p>  <p>  PCB is a scheme which extends the IP and IB schemes to recognise and respond to the reality that some people with an illness or disability have a capacity to engage in open market employment while continuing to need to receive some income support from the State. The duration a person can be in receipt of PCB is linked directly to the payment they moved from, subject to a maximum of 156 weeks.  </p>  <p>  The personal rate of payment of PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction regarding their capacity for work and the payment they are moving from, i.e., IP or IB.  After the medical assessment, if a person's restriction regarding their capacity for work is rated as moderate, severe or profound their payment continues at 50%, 75% or 100% of their previous rate, respectively. If assessed as &lsquo;mild&rsquo; they will not qualify for PCB.  </p>  <p>  PCB allows people to continue to receive a percentage of their previous payment while in employment.  In addition, the scheme has been designed so there are no restrictions on the number of hours a person in receipt of the payment can work and there are no restrictions on earnings. PCB is not a qualifying payment for the purposes of the fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  The Department also provides supports under its Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, including a heat supplement, which  may be awarded in cases where a person has exceptional essential heating costs due to ill health or infirmity and who cannot provide for such costs from within his or her own resources.  Where a person wishes to apply for a heat supplement, s/he should contact their local Intreo Centre.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to keep the range of supports available under review.

Participation limits on these schemes are necessary to allow for the maximum utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons.  It is important to note that participation is intended to be for a temporary fixed term and the positions offered are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, the placements are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the open labour market.</p>  <p>  In general, placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  Those participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification.  Participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award.   </p>  <p>  In both instances, a maximum of three consecutive year&rsquo;s participation is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a 12 month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment). </p>  <p>  The lifetime participation limit for the person concerned (312 weeks / 6 years) has been exceeded, their time having been extended due to the Covid 19 Pandemic.  The person concerned is scheduled to leave the scheme on the 19th November 2021 under a phased exit programme.  The Departments' Employment Support Service will work with former CE participants to ensure the benefits and experience they received during their time on CE are maximised.</p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2021.</p>  <p>  The programme provides funding towards food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes: the urban school meals scheme and the school meals (local projects) scheme.  The Urban School Meals Scheme for primary schools is operated and administered by local authorities and is part-financed by my Department.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed at primary schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m would be provided to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option. </p>  <p>  There are currently 186,205 pupils in 887 DEIS schools in Ireland. To provide a hot meal, at a cost of &euro;2.90 per child, per day, to all students in these schools would cost &euro;93.8m for a full school year. There were 25 DEIS schools in the hot school meals pilot and an additional 171 DEIS schools have been included in the extension this year. </p>  <p>  There are 561,411 students in 3,241 primary schools in Ireland and 379,184 students in 730 secondary schools. The total cost of providing a hot meal to every student in every primary and secondary school at a rate of &euro;2.90 per child, per day, would cost &euro;474.5m in a full school year. (&euro;293.1m for primary schools; &euro;181.4 for secondary schools)</p>  <p>  There are currently 226 primary schools and 42,744 children participating in the Hot Meals Scheme. In addition, 24,614 students in 118 secondary schools receive funding for a dinner clubs at the rate of &euro;1.90, per child, per day. Dinner clubs provide a hot meal, but are different from the Hot Meals clubs, in that they tend to be provided by schools with onsite cooking facilities, whereas food for Hot Meals clubs is cooked offsite and either delivered hot or reheated in the school.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to grow the hot school meals element of the school meals programme and building further on the significant extension announced as part of Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.  </p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme represents the first statutory entitlement to financial support for early learning and childcare. By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families.</p>  <p>  I have followed up with Pobal the scheme administrator for the NCS they have informed in relation the child in question,  it would seem was awarded a NCS subsidy of 20 hours, this is the subsidy awarded where parents are not engaged in work or study. This award can be used in term time only.</p>  <p>  The definition of work or study is broad, covering all forms of work or study arrangements: full-time, part-time, week-on/ week-off and zero hour contracts.  This makes the scheme as flexible as possible. The minimum hours required to engage in work or study to qualify for enhanced hours is very low &ndash; at just two hours per week. </p>  <p>  I am committed to keeping the scheme under review and to assess whether it is meeting its objectives. I have contracted Frontier Economics to undertake a review of the National Childcare Scheme in line with Section 26 of the Childcare Support Act.  </p>  <p>  Variations on the concept of a work/study test is widely used around the world and I have also requested that Frontier review the usage and evidence of efficacy of this approach in other countries.</p>  <p>  This work is due to be finalised in the final quarter of this year and will inform in an evidence based manner the future development of the scheme.</p></reply>

Piloting Baby Boxes is just one initiative which is part of a wide ranging strategy addressing various aspects of the lives of children from birth to age five including supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care and health initiatives. </p>  <p>  The gift of the Baby Box is intended as a welcome from the State for a new arrival to a family and an acknowledgement of this very significant moment for parents. The universal distribution of Baby Boxes also reflects an important equality principle that each child is given something of equal value at the start of their life. The concept of Baby Boxes has been implemented in a number of countries whereby parents receive a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood. The pilot will undertake research and consultation to determine items for inclusion in the pack, informed by the commitments in the First 5 strategy, and these may include safety items, toys to support early development and books.</p>  <p>  Key objectives with the Baby Box and linked communications will include support for parent-infant bonding, information on baby development and early learning, advice and support for breastfeeding and promotion of infant health and safety. </p>  <p>  Owing to Covid-19, work on the pilot project was delayed.  However, a First 5 Project Specialist has now been recruited in my Department and will lead on this project. A working group will be established for this project and terms of reference will be developed to guide its development.  Key tasks for the working group include agreeing the full scope of the project and developing a detailed project plan. Considerations will include the scale and focus of the pilot, optimal timing and channel of distribution for the baby box and the possible contents.  That stage of the project will consider how parents from will be informed about the project and how they can register their interest.  There will be a clear emphasis in the project for it to be as inclusive as possible of all parents. Research and engagement with parents will also be undertaken to inform the pilot.</p>  <p>  Following an initial scoping phase, the working group will oversee a process to appoint suitable partners to develop and distribute the baby boxes and undertake a full evaluation of the pilot.</p></reply>

The minimum eligibility age of 2 years and 8 months for the ECCE programme was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years education and care in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios. The number of entry points reverted to one at the beginning of September 2018.</p>  <p>  This measure addressed the previous situation with regard to three entry points whereby there was a broad fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of and ensures a programme that is equitable for all children.</p>  <p>  One enrolment period at the start of the preschool year has streamlined the administration process and makes it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. It also makes it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children. </p></reply>

It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases. The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. </p><p>9,743 craft apprentices are currently waiting for access to off-the-job training.  A breakdown by apprenticeship and phase is attached.</p><p>In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:</p><p>-  Craft apprentice off-the-job training was prioritised for a return to on-site learning across further and higher education institutions as COVID restrictions allowed.</p><p>-  Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.</p><p>-  &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand.</p><p>-  An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6).</p><p>-  A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is in delivery. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time.</p><p>-  Phase 2 apprentice commence off-the-job training throughout the year. SOLAS are engaging with the ETBs to maximise and expand provision to clear the waiting lists for phase 2 training.  An update issued to ETBs on 20 September, with a number of information sessions for staff due to take place over the coming weeks.</p><p>-  Phase 4 and 6 intakes are currently scheduled three time per year &ndash; September, January and April. Additional capacity coming on stream at phase 4 and 6 from September has resulted with in the region of 2,500 phase 4 and 6 apprentices scheduled to commence off-the-job training in September, up from 2,100 per intake immediately pre-COVID.</p><p>-  In the event that Phase 4 and 6 are prevented from returning at full capacity, a number of alternatives remain available to ensure that craft apprentices are not precluded from qualifying in a timely manner, including the potential for competency assessments to allow apprentices to qualify. Any such measure would need to safeguard the integrity of the Craft Certificate qualification.</p><p>The additional investment in supports, as well as training providers re-commencing in September at full capacity will mean that by the end of December 2021, the respective proportion of apprentices returned to training will be:</p><p>-  35 per cent of Phase 2;</p><p>-  40 per cent of Phase 4; and</p><p>-  60 per cent of Phase 6 apprentices.</p><p>Subject to continued access to workshops and training facilities in addition to the rollout of additional places, it is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training at Phases 4 and 6 will be called in the early months of 2022. The waiting list for Phase 2 apprentices is expected to be completely cleared by the end of 2022.</p><p>A public update issued on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>on 23 September which outlined the comprehensive programme of work underway and to ensure that information is available to apprentices, employers and prospective apprentices.  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Apprentices

Several of the actions in this strategy centre around ensuring that HEIs have access to low-cost financing in order to support their building of student accommodation. One of these actions involved the introduction of legislation to empower the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to lend directly to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) for the development of student accommodation. This legislation was commenced in 2017, and so far three universities - TCD, UCC and UCD have had a total of &euro;157 million in loans approved by the HFA, which will provide more than 1,400 new student bed spaces.</p>  <p>  In June I, along with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, announced that &euro;75 million of financing had been successfully sourced for the Council of Europe Bank for the building of student accommodation in universities.</p>  <p>  In the context of significant unmet demand for student accommodation, I was extremely disappointed to see the recent granting by Local Authorities of "Change of Use" permissions to allow privately-owned purpose built student accommodation be used for other purposes. This runs contrary to the Student Accommodation Strategy. I welcome the issuing of a circular to Local Authorities underscoring the critical need for purpose-built student accommodation to be available to meet the needs of students in third level education.</p>  <p>  Housing For All, the Government's recently announce plan for housing, contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists, through access to appropriate financing, and a specific action in relation to legislating to allow for Technological Universities to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency. </p>  <p>  My officials and I will continue to work with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the universities, and the Union of Students in Ireland on these issues.</p></reply>

The most urgent issues were addressed as part of the Department of Education&rsquo;s school building programme (plus a small equipment allocation) but there was little opportunity to take a strategic or long-term approach to investment. </p>  <p>  Under the current NDP, a dedicated capital envelope was established for the FET sector for the first time.   At this time, funding is being largely directed to address the most immediate health and safety issues, and to support the expansion of apprenticeship provision. Also, a Devolved Capital Grant of just over &euro;8m has been extended to the FET sector for 2021. This grant can be used by ETBs for a range of capital priorities, including preparatory work for larger investments, such as the commissioning of building condition surveys.  </p>  <p>  My Department is working with SOLAS and the ETB sector to build up the governance, strategic framework and delivery capability required for the implementation of a FET capital programme over the coming years.  The outcome of the review of the NDP, expected in the near future, will inform the level of resources available for the programme, including large-scale FET capital projects. </p>  <p>  We continue to work closely with SOLAS and the ETB sector on all such matters.</p></reply>

Several of the actions in this strategy centre around ensuring that HEIs have access to low-cost financing in order to support their building of student accommodation.</p>  <p>  One of these actions involved the introduction of legislation to empower the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to lend directly to HEIs for the development of student accommodation. This legislation was commenced in 2017, and so far three universities - TCD, UCC and UCD have had a total of &euro;157 million in loans approved by the HFA, which will provide more than 1,400 new student bed spaces.</p>  <p>  In June I, along with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, announced that &euro;75 million of financing had been successfully sourced for the Council of Europe Bank for the building of student accommodation in universities.</p>  <p>  Housing For All, the Government's recently announce plan for housing, contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists, through access to appropriate financing, and a specific action in relation to legislating to allow for Technological Universities to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency. My officials and I will continue to work with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to advance this.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is also engaging with all the universities, including the technological universities, to explore further options which may be available to increase the availability of student accommodation. </p></reply>

The package includes financial support for further and higher education to return on-site safely and in line with public health advice, and additional student supports for students in further and higher education. &euro;21 million of this funding will be allocated to provide specific extra supports for students including an extra &euro;3m for student mental health, an extra &euro;10m for the Student Assistance Fund which provides financial supports to students experiencing financial difficulties while in college, and &euro;8m for the Mitigating Educational Disadvantage Fund which supports and engages disadvantaged learners.

Under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students. All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution.</p>  <p>  Third level institutions are autonomous entities responsible for their own day-to-day operations, management and administration.  Any determination as to the level of fees to be charged is a matter for them in light of their own particular conditions and circumstances, and there are no current plans for the Department to provide advice in such matters.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all institutions to engage with students in relation to any issues, including course delivery and fees.</p></reply>

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </p>  <p>  However, all applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the legislation. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment of the applicant.  All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.</p>  <p>  I am deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and at all levels of public health restrictions.  However, processing rates have been negatively impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed and it has not been possible to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies since March 2020. </p>  <p>  Regrettably, there are just over 22,200 applications currently on hand. These applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made and are "ceremony ready". </p>  <p>  For applicants that were in the final stages of processing, in January, my Department opened a temporary system to enable these applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since then, my Department has delivered on its commitment to communicate with 6,500 applicants by the end of June, inviting them to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. </p>  <p>  As of 15 September 2021, 6,167 certificates of naturalisation have been issued so far this year and a significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers have and benefitted from these new arrangements. A further 1,000 people have paid the statutory fee and will receive their certificates in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Since 13 September, the staff of the Citizenship Division of my Department have returned to the office on a new attendance pattern that will see a gain of approximately 500 production hours per week due to increased footfall on-site. To further address the volume of applications on hand, additional staff are being assigned to the citizenship team; and a number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. </p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Based on this, my objective is to achieve an improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022.</p></reply>

A High Court case, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, resulted in significant delays in 2019, and the loss of over six months processing time. Additionally, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted on staff attendance in the office over the last 18 months and a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during this time.</p>  <p>  As a result, regrettably, the current average processing time for applications is 23 months and there are just over 22,200 applications currently on hand. These applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made and are "ceremony ready". </p>  <p>  I am deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and at all levels of public health restrictions.  However, the combined impact of the 2019 Jones judgment and the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 disruption has resulted in the processing timeline for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  Aside from these specific issues, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with my Department. </p>  <p>  In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.   </p>  <p>  For applicants that were in the final stages of processing, in January, my Department opened a temporary system to enable these applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since then, my Department has delivered on its commitment to communicate with 6,500 applicants by the end of June, inviting them to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. </p>  <p>  As of 15 September 2021, 6,167 certificates of naturalisation have been issued so far this year and a further 1,000 people have paid the statutory fee and will receive their certificates in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The Citizenship Division of my Department has prioritised bringing the oldest applications on hand to conclusion and a significant number of these applicants have received their certificates of naturalisation since the introduction of the temporary process.</p>  <p>  Since 13 September, the staff of the Citizenship Division of my Department have returned to the office on a new attendance pattern that will see a gain of approximately 500 production hours per week due to increased footfall on-site. To further address the volume of applications on hand, additional staff are being assigned to the citizenship team; and a number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. </p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Based on this, my objective is to achieve an improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022. </p></reply>

Specific individual development needs are identified on an ongoing basis through performance management. Small scale individual needs can be met by a range of providers on a one-off basis. The Common Purpose Meridian Programme was identified as an offering in this regard, in providing an environment for senior leaders to engage with other learners from across the public, private and NGO sectors to develop key change management and leadership development skillsets.</p></reply>

We are currently considering the most appropriate legislative vehicle to progress this issue. This is a complex area of the law and I want to ensure that we avoid any unintended or unforeseen consequences.</p>  <p>  In addition, the independent study on Familicide and Domestic Homicide Review is expected to be published soon.

This general scheme was developed to deliver on the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI) following publication of its fundamental in-depth review in 2018. </p>  <p>  A central tenet of the CoFPI report is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be a single organisation with a single workforce. To support this, CoFPI recommended that non-sworn members (i.e. Garda staff) should be recruited directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not to the general civil service, and should be treated as valued members of a single Garda workforce with a shared mission. </p>  <p>  The general scheme gives effect to this recommendation by providing for the Garda Commissioner to recruit and appoint Garda staff in accordance with the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. Under the provisions of the general scheme, the Minister may also designate by order that existing civil servants within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will change status, but only after engagement with trade unions and staff associations. </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that no changes to the status of existing Garda staff will take place solely as a result of the enactment of the proposed legislation.  A Ministerial order will be required before any designation to change the civil servant status of existing Garda staff may be made. The Minister must engage with any trade union or staff association concerned and consider any representations made by them. The general scheme provides for further reassurances on the terms and conditions of existing Garda staff prior to any agreement being reached with relevant unions or associations.  I should emphasise that this does not pose any risk to their current terms and conditions.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have been in contact with the relevant representative associations to brief them on the legislation, and are available to consult further as required.   </p>  <p>  The proposed changes will have no effect whatsoever on recruitment of Garda members, or on the allocation of policing resources by the Garda Commissioner.  In that regard, the Deputy will be aware that an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion was allocated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2021 which is enabling an ongoing programme of recruitment of Garda members and staff, albeit the pace of this has been impacted over the last 18 months by the pandemic.  Subject to Budget 2022, I hope that it will be possible for recruitment to reach normal levels next year.  </p></reply>

Services are delivered either directly by HSE employed staff, or on its behalf by a combination of private and &lsquo;Section 39&rsquo; organisations (i.e. voluntary/not-for-profit) providers who operate under service level agreements with the HSE.  There are also many home support users who self-fund entirely or self-fund additional support above the support provided via the HSE. There has been sustained investment in home-support services in recent years, with approximately &euro;630 million allocated in the National Service Plan 2021 to provide 24 million hours of home support. </p>  <p>  In the public sector any amendments to pay are carried out in line with the current public service agreement for those working in relevant agencies. It would not be appropriate for the Minister to comment directly on the terms and conditions of those working in Section 39 or other privately operated services.

I value their input - they play an important role in raising awareness and advocating for improvements to mental health service delivery.   </p>  <p>  I am giving detailed consideration to the submission, in consultation as appropriate with other relevant areas within the Department and with the HSE. More broadly, the Department is engaging in dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE in relation to the 2022 Estimates. Until these discussions are concluded it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this matter. However, I am committed to ensuring the continued enhancement of mental health services through the allocation of additional development funding in mental health in 2022. </p>  <p>  I would note for the Deputy that 2021 saw a record budget for mental health of over &euro;1.1 billion, including &euro;23 million to commence implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision in 2021 and the HSE National Service Plan. &euro;15 million is to address the additional challenges posed by Covid-19, including increased step-down beds, private surge capacity, extra resources for community mental health teams and reconfiguration of residential facilities to meet Mental Health Commission recommendations. An additional &euro;2.2 million was allocated in 2020 to develop telehealth and psychosocial responses to Covid-19 for healthcare workers and the public.</p>  <p>   While we do not yet fully understand Covid-19&rsquo;s impact on mental health, the extent of supports that may be required and how this will affect longer term service demand the Department and HSE continue to plan for any potential surge in demand as it arises and as services return to normal provision and capacity. The HSE has a range of proactive responses for any rise in service need. </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, with adaptations, enhancements and improvements, mental health services continued to operate to approximately 85-90% capacity. In particular, expanded and enhanced digital services were crucial in responding to both existing and new and emerging need.  </p></reply>

The recommendations involved extending the primary vaccination course with an mRNA dose for immunocompromised individuals aged 12 years and older irrespective of whether the initial doses were an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine.</p>  <p>  The third dose of an mRNA vaccine should be given a minimum of two months after the second dose of the extended vaccination schedule.</p>  <p>  It is currently anticipated that the administration of the third dose extension programme for immunocompromised will commence the week of 27 September and will take approximately 5-6 weeks to complete.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the NIAC has made a distinction between an additional vaccine for those who have mounted a sub-optimal immune response to the primary vaccination course and booster vaccine doses which may be required by some, or all, of the population as a result of waning immunity and vaccine effectiveness over time.</p>  <p>  On 8 September, I announced a further update to the Covid-19 vaccination programme following additional advice from the NIAC. The Committee has recommended a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine (irrespective of whether the primary vaccination course was of an mRNA or adenoviral vector) for residents aged 65 years and older living in Long Term Residential Care Facilities and for those aged 80 years and older living in the community.</p>  <p>  I have accepted this advice and the HSE has been requested to make the necessary arrangements to operationalise the recommendations. The NIAC continues to examine emerging evidence regarding booster vaccines for those with waning immunity and reduced effectiveness in other groups.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that publication of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. My Department and the Office of the Attorney General continue to prioritise the drafting of this complex legislation and will engage intensively over the next few months to finalise the Bill.  </p>  <p>  The AHR legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a wide range of practices, including domestic altruistic surrogacy, as well as: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. The legislation also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions of the Bill outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s).</p>  <p>  Overall, the provisions outlined within the Bill will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight. </p></reply>

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p>  <p>  The model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments).</p>  <p>  Structured referral pathways are being put in place and patients referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.</p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients, both male and female, presenting with infertility issues without the need to undergo IVF, or other advanced AHR, treatments.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;2m was provided to the HSE to commence Phase One of the roll-out in 2020 and this was utilised specifically in respect of the development of the first four Regional Fertility Hubs &ndash; namely, Cork University Maternity Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital.</p>  <p>  Additional funding was made available in Budget 2021 to enable the continuation of Phase One this year, through the setting-up of the final two Regional Fertility Hubs, one located within the Saolta Hospital Group, at University Hospital Galway, and one within the University of Limerick Hospital Group, at Nenagh General Hospital. Work is well underway in relation to the recruitment, refurbishment and equipping of these two Hubs.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the completion of Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced. </p>  <p>  Publication of the Bill to regulate the area of assisted human reproduction is a priority for the Government, and officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General will continue to engage intensively over the next few months to finalise this complex piece of legislation. </p>  <p>  The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.</p></reply>

This funding has been used to increase acute and community bed capacity, providing enhanced care in the community, including access to diagnostics, additional home supports, including funding for up to 5 million additional home support hours, streamlining care pathways and tackling waiting lists.</p>  <p>  On 10 September, my Department published a report on progress in the first six months of the new Strategy &amp;amp; Action Plan. The report shows that significant progress has been made. Of 112 deliverables for the first six months, 84 were on track and 25 were being progress with minor challenges and 3 are experiencing major challenges. The vast majority of Sl&aacute;intecare projects are progressing as scheduled in spite of the difficulties presented by the cyberattack four months ago and the ongoing COVID pandemic response.  </p>  <p>  Progress is continuing in this quarter. Discussions continue with the representative groups on implementation of the public-only consultant contract, a draft preliminary business case for the elective hospitals is now complete and is undergoing internal evaluation in the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  A new waiting list initiative will be published shortly and a proposal for the implementation of Regional Health Areas will be finalised before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund has been very successful; 41 projects have already transitioned to recurrent HSE funding, primarily through the Enhanced Community Care Fund while funding for many others is currently being explored as part of the Estimates process. These projects are making a significant contribution to reducing hospital admissions, presentations to emergency departments and helping people stay healthy in their communities for longer.  </p>  <p>  The question of filling vacancies on the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Advisory Council is currently under consideration.  </p></reply>

The Act contains measures recommended by the Steering Group Report on a Substance Misuse Strategy to address both the volume of alcohol consumed in Ireland and harmful patterns of alcohol consumption such as binge drinking. Harmful drinking patterns have particular impacts on young people with evidence showing that binge drinking impacts on the developing brain.   </p>  <p>  Pricing is one of the most effective interventions to address harmful patterns of drinking especially among young people.   </p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 (Sale and Supply of Alcohol Products) Regulations 2020 came into operation in January this year. These regulations have restricted price promotions in relation to alcohol products. Measures in the regulations include the prohibition of the sale of an alcohol product at a reduced price for a limited period and the prohibition of the sale of an alcohol product at a reduced price because that product is sold with another product or service.     </p>  <p>  In May of this year, I commenced section 11 of the Act on Minimum Unit Pricing. It will come into operation from 4 January 2022 and sets a minimum price of 10c per gram of alcohol. Minimum pricing is effective at addressing the harms associated with alcohol as international evidence shows that heavier drinkers tend to purchase cheaper alcohol than lighter drinkers. In addition, the introduction of a 10c minimum price will ensure that strong alcohol products are not cheaply available for children and young people.   </p>  <p>  Finally in November this year, two sections of the Act relating to alcohol advertising and alcohol sponsorship will become operational. The purpose of these provisions is to reduce the visibility of alcohol in daily life, particularly for children. Those provisions are:</p>  <p>  - A prohibition on alcohol advertising on a sports area during a sporting event, at events aimed at children or at events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children.</p>  <p>  - A prohibition on alcohol sponsorship of events aimed at children, events which the majority of participants or competitors are children and events involving driving or racing motor vehicles.</p></reply>

While this decline is welcome we want to drive the number of children who smoke down to zero and there are a number of initiatives taking place at national and at local level that are working towards that outcome.</p>  <p>  The Public Health (Tobacco &amp;amp; Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill will ban the sale of tobacco products at places or events intended for children, from mobile units or containers, and from self-service vending machines, all of which will reduce the availability of tobacco products to children. It will also prohibit the sale of tobacco products by people under the age of 18 and prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products to those under 18. Finally, it will create a licensing system for the retail sale of tobacco and nicotine inhaling products, with increased enforcement options available to the HSE in dealing with non-compliant retailers.</p>  <p>  In addition to legislation, community initiatives such as the &lsquo;Not Around Us&rsquo; campaigns in Limerick, Galway and Clare are contributing to the denormalisation of smoking for children and young people while the HSE Tobacco Free Ireland programme has worked with educators to develop content on the dangers of tobacco use as part of the Junior Cycle SPHE curriculum. This multi-faceted approach is, and will continue to be, crucial in ensuring that young people do not take up smoking.</p></reply>

Each CST will provide support across three Community Healthcare Networks, serving a population of approximately 150,000 patients per team. </p>  <p>  These multidisciplinary teams will support individuals with chronic disease in the community setting by providing specialist care closer to home.

This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Ivermectin.  </p>  <p>  As confirmed by HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group (www.hiqa.ie/sites/default/files/2021-02/Interventions-to-prevent-progression_Advice.pdf), evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention. </p>  <p>  HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on Ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of Ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of Ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4 February 2021 published a statement including the following:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified:</p>  <p>  - No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies;</p>  <p>  - No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;</p>  <p>  - A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.</p>  <p>  We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of Ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Further research was undertaken by HIQA and updated advice was provided to the NPHET on 12 May: COVID-19 - Interventions and health related factors that prevent infection or minimise progression to severe disease. This document was subsequently published by HIQA on the 23 June 2021: </p>  <p>  www.hiqa.ie/sites/default/files/2021-06/Advice-to-NPHET_Interventions-to-prevent-COVID-19.pdf </p>  <p>  One of the key findings of the review was that Ivermectin is not currently licensed for the treatment of COVID-19. From this evidence summary, there is currently insufficient information on whether it can be safely used to prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Ivermectin should therefore not be used as prophylaxis outside well-designed, regulated clinical trials as the benefits and harms are not yet clear when taken in the context of COVID-19 treatment. </p>  <p>  Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up, different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness. </p>  <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention outside of well conducted, well-regulated clinical trials. Furthermore, no evidence was identified for the effectiveness or safety of any non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p>  <p>  As the issues raised by the Deputy relate to operational matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that the Act, in its current form, did not place caps on the financial assessment of family owned and operated farms or businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care. This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family. These changes were mad through the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill, which was signed into law by the President 22 July 2021 and will come into effect 90 days later, on the 20 October 2021. </p>  <p>  The principal amendment introduced under the Act extended the three-year cap on contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where an appointed family successor commits to working the productive asset for a period of 6 years. To be considered for the 3-year cap, the legislation requires that an asset owned by an applicant for the Scheme or recently transferred to a family member is a productive family asset that has been actively worked by a family member for a significant period of time in advance of the person entering care.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of calculating the three-year period after which contributions will be capped under the amendment, time already spent in care when the amendment comes into force will be taken into account. This means that a person who entered nursing home care three or more years ago should be able to benefit from the relief under the amendment when it comes into force, provided they can meet the other conditions.</p>  <p>  However, the amendment does not provide for any retrospective relief or refunds on contributions to care made before the amendment comes into operation. Retrospective application of the proposed legislative changes would create a challenging precedent, involving high legal and administrative costs and risks, in attempting to apply retrospectively a complex set of conditions. It would also introduce a degree of inequity where conditions would be imposed in the past, with only some people in a position to satisfy those &ndash; as then unknown &ndash; conditions.</p>  <p>  The HSE Nursing Home Support Scheme Office has been involved throughout the development of the legislation as the responsible operational body. Appropriate training and updated guidance is being provided to staff involved in administering the scheme, and necessary changes to IT systems are being implemented.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre-cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised my department that they have approved 7 Outpatient ophthalmology initiatives and 1 See &amp;amp; Treat initiative for funding so far in 2021, which will facilitate treatment for 11,749 patients on ophthalmology waiting lists.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists. </p>  <p>  In order to address waiting lists in the immediate-short term the Department of Health, HSE, and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are finalising a waiting list Action Plan which will be in operation until the end of 2021. The Action plan will focus on addressing the backlog arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and the HSE cyber-attack. A longer term Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is an essential part of the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan approved by Government in May the year, is also currently being finalised. </p></reply>

CORU has introduced a new process whereby an applicant who has submitted their application for recognition can now begin the registration process at the same time, this means internationally qualified applicants can be placed on the register in a shorter timeframe. CORU advises that as this is a recent change, outcomes cannot yet be measured. </p><p>CORU has also scheduled additional board meetings for the Social Workers Registration Board for Quarter 4 in 2021 and into 2022 to support faster decision making.</p><p>In addition to the above measures, CORU has informed the Department that in October the Health and Social Care Professionals Council will consider a proposal to pilot an alternate mechanism for the recognition of qualifications, this pilot will include Social Work qualifications from Northern Ireland and is expected to significantly reduce timeframes.</p></reply>

The Task Force Report recommended that Personalised Budgets would be piloted and evaluated in an Irish context over a two year period. The HSE established the Personalised Budget Demonstration Projects in 2019. The Department of Health requested the National Disability Authority (NDA) to manage the evaluation of the Demonstration Project.</p>  <p>  Given the number of factors that the Task Force Report suggested should be tested in the Demonstration Project, the Department of Health, HSE and NDA recommended that a sample size of 180 Personalised Budget participants would be required to allow for a robust evaluation.</p>  <p>  There are currently 92 participants in the various stages on the Pilot Personalised Budget Demonstration Project. This means that the Demonstration Projects are running behind schedule. This is due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also due to other factors such as challenges in recruiting HSE staff and the cyber-attack on the HSE.</p>  <p>  The NDA has tendered for and selected an evaluation team to conduct the evaluation. The NDA has secured research ethics approval from some of the service providers supporting people who have engaged with the Personalised Budget Demonstration Project process and is actively engaged in seeking ethical approval from other service providers.</p>  <p>  The evaluation is designed to capture the experiences and outcomes of all the participants (who have consented to be part of the evaluation) regardless of what their primary disability might be. However, the evaluation team have taken the needs of participants with intellectual disabilities into consideration and have developed Plain English and Easy to Read evaluation materials. Those conducting the evaluation fieldwork have extensive experience of working directly with people with disabilities, including people with intellectual disabilities.</p>  <p>  A key output of the evaluation process will be a report capturing learning about the experiences and outcomes for persons with disabilities participating in the Demonstration Project, as well as consideration of the costs of administering the system. This will inform Department of Health considerations with regard to any future programme of Personalised Budgets.</p></reply>

Services will be networked and co-ordinated along standardised pathways to ensure that the right care is delivered in the right place at the right time.   </p>  <p>  Before recommending the designation of the Mater Hospital as the Major Trauma Centre for the Central Trauma Network, the Health Service Executive (HSE) undertook a clear and objective process to inform the recommendation for the designation.  This included the appointment of an Independent Assessment Panel, containing members expert in the retrieval and acute management of trauma patients, including those patients with head injuries.   The panel used a designation framework, which included service specifications and criteria to assess submissions from Hospital Groups.  This Framework had been subject to a public consultation, which allowed the HSE to meet with key stakeholders and gave interested parties an opportunity to seek further clarity on the service specifications and the designation criteria.  The recommendation to designate the Mater Hospital as the Major Trauma Centre for the Central Trauma Network was approved by Government in April 2021.</p>  <p>  The clear objective of the National Trauma Strategy is for all trauma patients to access the treatments they need in a timely manner.  This will be possible through the establishment of two Major Trauma Centres that have all trauma specialties, including neurosurgery.  The availability of all trauma specialties in one hospital will create very significant benefits for patients, including a reduced need for a secondary transfer, as well as reduced waiting times between sequential surgeries. As such, the National Trauma Office in the HSE is engaging closely with neurosurgeons with a view to them assisting in the planning of neurosurgical services in the Major Trauma Centre.</p></reply>

Where patrons have mixed immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult leaders/teachers). Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures. Number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and substantial social distance between individual pods.</p><p>In the light of the above, the Department guidance for drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes, where participants have mixed immunity status, is unchanged. The Department advise that the maximum number of participants is 20, to include organisers. This higher limit is subject to 2 metre social distancing in the venue. </p><p>From 22 October onwards, the majority of the remaining restrictions will be lifted and replaced by guidance and advice to enable us to work together to protect ourselves and to live our lives to the fullest extent possible. We will need to continue to monitor the ongoing risk from the disease and take steps individually and collectively in our everyday lives to keep this risk under control.</p><p>The following public health restrictions will be lifted:</p><p>-  requirements for physical distancing</p><p>-  requirements for mask wearing outdoors and in indoor private settings</p><p>-  limits on numbers at indoor and outdoor events and activities</p><p>-  restrictions on religious or civil ceremonies</p><p>-  limits on numbers that can meet in private homes/gardens</p><p>-  certification of vaccination, immunity or testing as a prerequisite for access to, or engagement in, any activities or events (with the exception of international travel)</p><p>-  restrictions on high-risk activities (for example: nightclubs)</p><p>Measures that will remain in place include:</p><p>-  self-isolation when we have symptoms</p><p>-  mask wearing in healthcare settings, indoor retail and on public transport</p><p>I appreciate the positive engagement by drug and alcohol support groups with the Department on this matter.

In that regard and in line with commitments in the Programme for Government, BreastCheck is currently implementing an age-extension project that will see all women aged between 50 to 69 years being invited for routine breast screening. </p>  <p>  In relation to consideration of any further age changes, such as reducing the age to people under the age of 50, it is vital we remember that breast screening is a population health screening measure. It is not an individual diagnostic test.  The balance between the benefits of screening and the potential harms or risks to the population as a whole require careful, evidence-based consideration and balancing.</p>  <p>  As with all our national screening programmes, BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for population-based screening programmes, which are kept under constant review. The balance between the benefits of screening and the potential harms or risks to the population as a whole require careful, evidence-based consideration and balancing.</p>  <p>  Decisions about changes to our national screening programmes will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).  This independent expert group considers the evidence for changes in a robust and transparent manner. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly. This ensures policy decisions are informed by the best available evidence and advice. </p>  <p>  The NSAC is currently finalising plans for its first &lsquo;annual call&rsquo; which will be announced later this year. Applications for proposals for new population based screening programmes and modifications to existing programmes, such as a reduction in the age of those eligible for screening, will be welcomed from the public as well as the HSE, health professionals and other professional bodies.  Further information on the 'annual call' will be published on the NSAC website.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to introduce a general practitioner service to breast check all young women of the age of 18 upwards as part of general practitioner visits under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.</p>  <p>  It is important that every woman is breast aware. This means knowing what is normal for them so that if any unusual change occurs, they will recognise it. The HSE have useful information in relation to self-checking their breasts on its website.</p>  <p>  If a woman becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP, who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.</p></reply>

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. It will build on the HSE&rsquo;s continual enhancement of existing service-provision and on emerging good practice across the current system of health and social care delivery as well as supporting family and unpaid carers. </p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery for home support services. </p>  <p>  The national roll-out of interRAI as the single assessment tool (incorporating the assessment of carers&rsquo; needs) will be integral to the new scheme, underpinning the provision of one streamlined process for responding to the evolving care-needs of the individual, from entry-level home-support through to intensive care in a residential setting. In this regard, funding was allocated for approximately 130 posts to support the national rollout of the InterRAI Ireland system as the standard assessment tool for care needs in the community. The system of regulation will ensure public confidence in the services provided as well as safeguarding service-users. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to delivering a &lsquo;Carers Guarantee&rsquo; proposal that will provide a core basket of services to carers across the country, regardless of where they live. This commitment is consistent with the National Carers' Strategy, which seeks to support family carers to care with confidence through the provision of adequate information, training, services and supports.  </p>  <p>  In line with this commitment, and as a first step towards implementing the Carers&rsquo; Guarantee, &euro;2 million was allocated in Budget 2021 to provide a more standard package of supports to family carers in every region, in tandem with the community and voluntary sector. Discussions are underway between my Department and the HSE to determine how this funding will be allocated and to ensure measures introduced will work towards addressing geographical inequity of access to supports.</p></reply>

Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine). The HIQA has confirmed that this HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021/2022 and I have requested that my officials give consideration to the outcome of this work in the context of the immunisation programme.</p></reply>

Included in current priorities is transferring the care of children aged 8+ years to the care of local private optometrists, creating a new role of Consultant Medical Ophthalmologist, and recruiting additional Consultant Medical Ophthalmologists to other CHOs.</p>  <p>  Specific proposed recruitment campaigns linked to primary eye services will be considered in the context of the PCESRG Report, subject to existing recruitment processes.</p>  <p>  The 2021 National Service Plan recognised the need for an unprecedented expansion of the permanent health workforce through permanent appointments.

Each application within a CHO is assessed, both for medical card and LTI card patients, by the local Resource Allocation Group. A determination is made regarding approval based on priority and funding availability within local budgets.

Unfortunately, the HSE has not been successful in recruiting a GP to this practice.</p>  <p>  It is therefore planned that the group practice in the town of Templemore, will take on the panel of patients on an interim basis.

Additional nursing and administrative staff have also been recruited for this practice. </p>  <p>  GMS patients have been advised of the new arrangements and how to access the new practice. Whilst the HSE has no responsibility for private patients, private patients have been advised by practice staff of the need to source a new GP. Private patients can contact the Group practice or any other practice of their choice and request to be taken on as a private patient. Should any private patient find it difficult to source a new GP, they can contact the local HSE Primary Care Unit who can support them in accessing a GP in so far as is possible.</p></reply>

This comprehensive piece of legislation will encompass the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a very wide range of practices, including domestic altruistic surrogacy. I can assure the Deputy that publication of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. Officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General continue to prioritise the drafting of this complex legislation and will engage intensively over the next few months to finalise the Bill.</p>  <p>  Another Programme for Government commitment is the introduction of the model of care for infertility, which was developed by officials in my Department in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme. This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.</p>  <p>  The model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments). Structured referral pathways are being put in place and patients referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.</p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks in the six Hospital Groups across the country, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced.</p>  <p>  The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.</p></reply>

This comprehensive and far-reaching piece of legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a wide range of practices, including domestic altruistic surrogacy, as well as: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. The legislation also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR. </p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the new AHR Regulatory Authority. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). </p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions. As issues relating to international surrogacy concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments, my Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of this policy area. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that publication of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. Officials in my Department and the Office of the Attorney General continue to prioritise the drafting of this complex legislation and will engage intensively over the next few months to finalise the Bill. Subject to certain criteria being met, AHR treatment will be available to people irrespective of gender, marital status or sexual orientation. Overall, the provisions outlined within the Bill will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight. </p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (the Act of 2015) reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types. The Minister for Health is responsible for Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act of 2015 and these Parts commenced on 4 May 2020. Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 deal with the issue of donor-assisted human reproduction. </p>  <p>  Subject to certain conditions, the provisions of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act of 2015 provide for the parentage of donor-conceived children born after the commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 and retrospective declarations of parentage for donor-conceived children born prior to the commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3. </p>  <p>  On a broad level, issues related to legal guardianship &ndash; including responsibility for the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 &ndash; come under the remit of the Minister for Justice. Specifically, section 6B of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by the Act of 2015, provides for the guardianship of donor-conceived children to whom Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act of 2015 apply. </p>  <p>  Finally, matters concerning social welfare payments are the responsibility of the Minister of Social Protection.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the scheme are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  Gestational diabetes is not a permanent or long-term illness and is, therefore, not covered by the Scheme. There are currently no plans to make specific provision for gestational diabetes under any new or existing health scheme.</p>  <p>  However, there are other supports for access to medical approved items such as the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) and the General Medical Services Scheme (GMS) that would assist patients with gestational diabetes.</p>  <p>  Under the DPS, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p>  <p>  The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Patients may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

Under this programme, adult GMS patients, those who hold a medical card or GP visit card, with a diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes are eligible to be managed as part of the programme by their GP.</p>  <p>  The 2019 GP Agreement introduced the chronic disease management programme for GMS patients who have one or more specific chronic diseases, of which Type 2 Diabetes is one. The structured programme commenced in 2020 and is being rolled out to all adult GMS patients over four years (2020 to 2023). This year the programme has been rolled out to those aged 65 years and over. The chronic disease management programme will replace the Diabetes cycle of care programme as it is rolled out.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependents may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card.</p>  <p>  There is currently no plan to extend type 2 diabetes care under the chronic disease management programme to patients who do not hold a medical or GP visit card.</p>  <p>  While Type 2 diabetic patients who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card are not eligible under the Diabetes cycle of care or chronic disease management programmes, diabetes is one of the conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme. Under this scheme, patients with diabetes can receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness free of charge, regardless of whether they hold a medical card.</p></reply>

In this regard and in line with commitments in the Programme for Government, BreastCheck is currently implementing an age-extension project that will see all women aged between 50 to 69 years being invited for routine breast screening.</p>  <p>  In relation to consideration of any further age changes, it is vital we remember that breast screening is a population health screening measure. It is not an individual diagnostic test.  The balance between the benefits of screening and the potential harms or risks to the population as a whole require careful, evidence-based consideration and balancing.</p>  <p>  As with all our national screening programmes, BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for population-based screening programmes, which are kept under constant review. The balance between the benefits of screening and the potential harms or risks to the population as a whole require careful, evidence-based consideration and balancing.</p>  <p>  Decisions about changes to our national screening programmes will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).  This independent expert group considers the evidence for changes in a robust and transparent manner. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly. This ensures policy decisions are informed by the best available evidence and advice. </p>  <p>  The NSAC is currently finalising plans for its first &lsquo;annual call&rsquo; which will be announced later this year. Applications for proposals for new population based screening programmes and modifications to existing programmes, such as a reduction in the age of those eligible for screening, will be welcomed from the public as well as the HSE, health professionals and other professional bodies.  Further information on the 'annual call' will be published on the NSAC website.</p></reply>

This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two Outpatient Department and urgent care centres at Connolly and Tallaght campuses, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. </p>  <p>  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes and the Employment Order. In addition, there remain risks beyond the control of the Development Board and the contractor, arising from Brexit, the global pandemic, global supply chain difficulties and shortages of construction raw materials. However, the contractor is working hard to mitigate those risks where possible. </p>  <p>  Since the commencement of the NCH project construction, just under &euro;805m has been drawn down for  works on the project across the three sites.</p>  <p>  Definitive updates on outturn costs cannot be provided due to the fact that there is a live contract in place and speculation on any costs would be detrimental to the Development Board&rsquo;s commercial engagements.</p>  <p>  Despite delays, the new children&rsquo;s hospital building at St James&rsquo;s is taking shape. The concrete frame was completed at the end of March which reaches the highest point in the building. This &lsquo;topping out&rsquo; is an important milestone in any construction project.  The fa&ccedil;ade to the building will be practically complete and weathertight by the end of 2021 and the internal fit-out of a range of clinical areas is progressing well. </p>  <p>  The second paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght Hospital was substantially completed in early September 2021, in line with the contractor&rsquo;s programme schedule, and then handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland on 15 September 2021.</p>  <p>  The new facility is expected to open in mid-November after a period of operational commissioning and equipping. This will further drive the shift towards ambulatory care provision. Together with the Urgent Care Centre, CHI at Connolly, these new facilities will improve access to urgent care for a significant number of paediatric patients. The opening of the second of the three new campuses, will mark another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children&rsquo;s services.</p></reply>

In this regard and in line with commitments in the Programme for Government, BreastCheck is currently implementing an age-extension project that will see all women aged between 50 to 69 years being invited for routine breast screening.</p>  <p>  In relation to consideration of any further age changes, such as extending the age to people over the age of 69, it is vital we remember that breast screening is a population health screening measure. It is not an individual diagnostic test.  The balance between the benefits of screening and the potential harms or risks to the population as a whole require careful, evidence-based consideration and balancing.</p>  <p>  As with all our national screening programmes, BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for population-based screening programmes, which are kept under constant review. The balance between the benefits of screening and the potential harms or risks to the population as a whole require careful, evidence-based consideration and balancing.</p>  <p>  Decisions about changes to our national screening programmes will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).  This independent expert group considers the evidence for changes in a robust and transparent manner. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly. This ensures policy decisions are informed by the best available evidence and advice. </p>  <p>  The NSAC is currently finalising plans for its first &lsquo;annual call&rsquo; which will be announced later this year. Applications for proposals for new population based screening programmes and modifications to existing programmes, such changes in the age of those eligible for screening, will be welcomed from the public as well as the HSE, health professionals and other professional bodies.  Further information on the 'annual call' will be published on the NSAC website.</p></reply>

Having spoken with the individual concerned, I understand that this arose from his purchase of an unstable fishing vessel in the Netherlands in 2007, essentially a private commercial transaction between two contracting parties to purchase a vessel. The responsibility for ensuring the authenticity of the details, specifications and stability of the vessel being purchased rested with the purchaser.</p>  <p>  The core issue here relates to the safety and safety certification of the vessel purchased.  The safety of fishing vessels and safety certification, including matters relating to stability, is the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has no function in relation to the safety certification of Fishing vessels or matters arising in relation to their stability. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Programme is the principal source of development funding for our seafood sector.  The Programme is implemented under the provisions of the EMFF Regulation (508/2014) which specifies to what purposes funds can be granted.  There is no particular provision of the EMFF Regulation that would facilitate an ex-gratia payment to assist in the case raised by the Deputy.  Furthermore, it is not possible to provide a grant for the decommissioning of the vessel concerned, as under the terms of the EMFF Regulation, decommissioning is not permitted after 31 December 2018.  A new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) Regulation (2021/1139) for the 2021- 27 period was enacted in July 2021 and my Department is preparing a new corresponding Seafood Development Programme, which should be in operation next year.  However, similar to the EMFF Regulation, the new EMFAF only permits decommissioning of fishing vessels for very specific purposes concerned with addressing an identified imbalance in a particular fleet segment and only allows decommissioning of active fishing vessels and so is unlikely to be relevant to the case identified by the Deputy.</p></reply>

In Budget 2021, provision was made for the introduction of a dairy beef pilot programme.  The objective of the pilot programme which was launched in April 2021, is to both build on the gains of previous BEEP schemes in terms of weight/performance recording, and to facilitate further integration of the dairy and beef systems, by providing support for farmers who are rearing progeny from the dairy herd. </p>  <p>  Another initiative aimed at creating greater integration between the beef and dairy systems is the development of the Dairy Beef Index (DBI).  This was developed by ICBF to promote high quality beef cattle bred from the dairy herd, while maintaining optimal dairy traits.   As the data set underpinning this index increases, so does the reliability and usefulness of the index to farmers as a decision making tool and as a mechanism to provide greater integration between dairy and beef systems. With the development of the ICBF&rsquo;s Dairy Beef Index,  data from ICBF show that genetic trends for beef traits have improved for beef sires, reassuring farmers that these beef-dairy calves have improved beef potential.</p>  <p>  A support for a dairy beef calf welfare has been proposed as part of the development of Ireland's CAP strategic plan (CSP). A public consultation on the draft interventions proposed for the CSP has recently ended and the submissions received are being reviewed. I will continue to consult on the content of the plan with the key stakeholders, through the CAP Consultative Committee and through additional public consultation later in the year. </p>  <p>  I can assure the deputy that my Department and I are committed to supporting the enhanced integration of the dairy and beef sectors.</p>  <p>  This approach is reflected in 'Food Vision 2030', the stakeholder-led strategy for the sustainable development of the sector over the next decade. Food Vision includes the following action under a Goal aimed at improving the competitiveness and productivity of primary producers:</p>  <p>  Mission 2, Goal 1, Action 1:</p>  <p>  'promote greater integration of the dairy and beef sectors, especially in relation to the production of beef coming from the dairy sector'.</p></reply>

This combination of events led to a backlog of licence applications.  I am very aware of the obligations my Department has towards applicants, but also to ensure that systems and processes are compliant with legal framework.</p><p>In respect of licensing, resources have been significantly increased; ecologists have gone from one in 2018 to 27 currently and 21 additional forestry inspectors have been deployed.  The number of licences issued had increased through May and into early July. However, there was a significant fall off in licences issued in July and August, due to a new legal requirement for an additional 30-day public consultation.  </p><p>Applications in the system, received before 11<sup>th</sup>January this year when the Forestry Licence Viewer (FLV) was introduced, had to be manually examined and redacted of personal information before the documents were published in the FLV for the second public consultation.  </p><p>As the introduction of this SI resulted in a reduction in the number of licences issued in June and July, it is unlikely that our target of 4,500 will be met this year and it will be closer to 4,000. </p><p>I must note, however that licensing outputs have increased over the past three weeks, with 110 licences issued weekending 3<sup>rd</sup>September, 136 the following week and 146 weekending 17<sup>th</sup>.  </p><p>The Department is currently examining every afforestation application in the system and has deployed 10 ecologists to deal specifically with afforestation. I would encourage those with a valid afforestation licence to proceed with planting and I am advised there is 5,700ha with approval to plant.</p><p>The Department will shortly announce the successful bidder for the recent tendering process to engage external expertise to carry out an end-to-end regulatory and process review, which has been sought by the Project Woodland working groups.  </p><p>This is in addition to the systems analyst already in place.  In the meantime, the Department is working with forestry companies to improve the quality of information provided with licence applications.  This has already yielded results for felling licences.  </p><p>The same exercise has been completed for forest roads and will shortly be carried out on afforestation licence applications.

The draft CSP is also subject to an ex-ante evaluation, Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment including a public consultation on the draft CSP and draft Environmental Report. </p>  <p>  The Department has recently completed a five-week public consultation on the proposed draft interventions for the CSP 2023-2027 with over 1,000 responses received.

In regard of the recent agreement signed with China to export breeding pigs to that country, animal welfare requirements during transport must be in accordance with EU rules, which are set out primarily in Council Regulation (EC) no 1/2005 on the Protection of Animals during Transport and Related Operations and associated national legislation.</p>  <p>  The Regulation sets out legal measures to ensure animal welfare during transport, and has specific provisions on air transport of pigs to safeguard their welfare throughout the journey. It also refers to the need for conditions during transport to comply with International Air Transport Association (IATA) live animals Regulations. </p>  <p>  - Pigs are transported in specially designed pens or containers appropriate to their species and size which comply with IATA Regulations. </p>  <p>  - They are transported only in conditions where air quality, temperature and pressure can be maintained within an appropriate range during the entire journey, having regard to the animals&rsquo; specific needs. </p>  <p>  - Maximum loading densities for pigs are set which must not be exceeded, in order to protect their welfare.</p>  <p>  Officials veterinarians of my Department assess journey plans and monitor loading to ensure that welfare legislation is complied with.  The high genetic merit breeding pigs that will be transported to China will be transported with every possible measure to minimise any risk of injury and suffering. </p>  <p>  The Department takes its responsibilities in the matters of regulating this trade, and of protecting animal welfare, very seriously - it exercises close oversight, and deploys considerable resources to the area of animal welfare in general, including in respect of animals being transported.</p></reply>

This combination of events led to a backlog of licence applications.  I am very aware of the obligations my Department has towards applicants, but also to ensure that systems and processes are compliant with legal framework.</p><p>In respect of licensing, resources have been significantly increased; ecologists have gone from one in 2018 to 27 currently and 21 additional forestry inspectors have been deployed.  The number of licences issued had increased through May and into early July.  However, there was a significant fall off in licences issued in July and August, due to a new legal requirement for an additional 30-day public consultation. </p><p>Applications in the system, received before 11<sup>th</sup>January this year when the Forestry Licence Viewer (FLV) was introduced, had to be manually examined and redacted of personal information before the documents were published in the FLV for the second public consultation. </p><p>As the introduction of this SI resulted in a reduction in the number of licences issued in June and July, it is unlikely that our target of 4,500 will be met this year and it will be closer to 4,000.</p><p>I must note, however that licensing outputs have increased over the past three weeks, with 110 licences issued the week ending 3<sup>rd</sup>September, 136 the following week and 146 the week ending the 17<sup>th</sup>. </p><p>The Department will shortly announce the successful bidder for the recent tendering process to engage external expertise to carry out an end-to-end regulatory and process review, which has been sought by the Project Woodland working groups.  </p><p>This is in addition to the systems analyst already in place.  In the meantime, my Department is working with forestry companies to improve the quality of information provided with licence applications.  This has already yielded results for felling licences.  The same exercise has been completed for forest roads and will shortly be carried out on afforestation licence applications.  I expect that licensing output will continue apace for the remainder of the year.</p><p>The number of tree felling licences issued from 2016 to 2020 is in the following table.

The Act was passed, after a lengthy and constructive debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas and came into operation on 6th March 2014.</p><p>The Department is committed to ongoing promotion and enforcement of animal welfare standards and all animal welfare reports are followed up by Veterinary Staff in the Regional Veterinary Offices or in some cases are referred to the ISPCA or DSPCA for attention by their authorised officers. In many of these cases sanction or prosecution is not the most proportionate or effective course action in achieving a positive outcome. </p><p>Often the provision of guidance, advice and education can alleviate welfare concerns for both the animal and the owner. </p><p>Offences under the Act may be prosecuted in the District Court by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, local authorities and member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Matters tried on indictment are the remit of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  </p><p>The data below relate to cases prosecuted at the suit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>Since March 2014, 95 individuals have been successfully prosecuted. Fines in excess of &euro;65,000 have been imposed. 11 persons have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment which were suspended in 9 cases. The Probation Act was applied in 8 instances.</p><p>Twenty persons have been disqualified from keeping animals under section 58 of the Act.</p><p>In 46 cases, summonses have issued or files have been sent to the DPP with a view to initiating prosecution. A further 7 are currently being examined by my Department with a view to pursuing a prosecution if the evidence so warrants.</p></reply>

I understand that the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) issued updated guidelines for public libraries to each local authority on 24 September 2021 following a meeting of its Health &amp;amp; Safety Operational Committee which reviewed the LGMA's current COVID-19 documentation.

These bodies are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners, with any unclaimed funds transferred by the holding institution, each year, to the Dormant Accounts Fund which is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency. The transfer of moneys takes place on the basis that the beneficial owner has a guaranteed right of reclaim at any time in the future.</p><p>The legislation also introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed. These funds can be used for the purposes of measures to assist the personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; the educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged or; persons with a disability. The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2012 provides for the Minister to put in place Disbursement Schemes which cover a three year period. These schemes set out the principles and priority areas for disbursements over the period. Subsequent Annual Action Plans, which are also prepared by the Minister in consultation with other Ministers, detail the approved measures for funding each year. These Disbursement Schemes and Action Plans, including the current ones in place, are available on the Departments website. <i>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/c376c9-dormant-accounts-fund/</i></p><p>The current 2021 Dormant Accounts Action Plan details funding of &euro;51 million for 46 measures across 10 Government Departments. The 2022 Dormant Accounts Action Plan is currently in preparation and will be published shortly after Budget 2022. It is expected that this Action Plan will provide for a similar level of support in 2022. </p><p>Annual reports are also published on the website, with the most recent report for 2020 detailing funding measures totalling &euro;93.5m, which included once off funding of &euro;45 million to support the Covid-19 Stability Fund which provided grants to charities, community and voluntary organisations and social enterprises who were supporting the most vulnerable in society throughout the pandemic.</p><p>Finally, the most recent information from the NTMA with regard to the value of the Dormant Accounts Fund shows an overall balance of &euro;283.7 million in the fund at the end of August 2021, with &euro;108 million of this set aside for possible future refunds to beneficial owners of the funds.</p></reply>
