At that meeting, the Chair of the Board of Oberstown, Professor Ursula Kilkelly, gave a detailed update on the current situation.</p><p>She outlined, among other things the serious legal difficulties associated with publishing the full report, for reasons which have been well set out on a number of occasions. </p><p>The House will be aware that I also met with the Joint Committee on the matter on 18 December last and offered my perspective. I do not believe that the situation has changed since that time.</p><p>At the Joint  Oireachtas Committee meeting of 30 January there was a suggestion that the Chair would examine whether a summary of the legal advice given to the Board of Oberstown might be prepared and supplied to the Committee. The Chair agreed to examine whether this is possible and I understand that she is pursuing the matter.</p><p>I would reiterate that the recommendations of the Operational Review, which are at the kernel of how we move forward, were published in July 2017 and are being implemented as part of a significant package of reform in Oberstown.</p><p>In addition to the Operational Review, the Board commissioned a number of other reports at the same time, with a view to engaging external expertise to support the development of the Campus. These reviews included security, health and safety and behaviour management.</p><p>Deputies will recall that I established a Review Implementation Group whose final report, received in December 2017, produced a coherent plan to implement the recommendations of the various reports.</p><p>An updated Action Plan from the Review Implementation Group was completed in May 2018 and was published on my Department&rsquo;s website. My Department continues to monitor the Review Implementation Group and the second report on the implementation of the recommendations was published on 29 January last.</p><p>My focus now is on ensuring that all of the key recommendations are implemented and to ensure that Oberstown observes best practice and international standards. I believe that this is the best way forward for the young people at the campus.</p></reply>

Emergency care orders are only granted by the Courts where there is an immediate threat to the safety of a child.  Social workers seeking an Emergency Care Order are often acting to protect a child during a crisis. </p>  <p>  Information from the Child Care Law Reporting Project indicates that Emergency Care Orders are the least commonly sought Order. They are also the Order of shortest duration, lasting a maximum of 8 days.</p>  <p>  Section 13 of the Child Care Act 1991 specifies the circumstances required for an Emergency Care Order to be granted. The operation of Section 13 by Tusla social workers was raised by Dr Geoffrey Shannon in his audit of how the Garda use their powers under Section 12 of the Act.  </p>  <p>  Section 12 allows the Garda remove a child from a situation of acute risk.  The child is then transferred to Tusla which undertakes an assessment of the child&rsquo;s situation.  Tusla may return the child home, if their situation is deemed safe, or apply for an Emergency Care Order under section 13 of the Act. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that there has been no empirical work on applications being made to the Courts under section 13 by social workers. I was sufficiently concerned about the lack of data on this crucial practice issue that I requested Tusla to commission research on the topic. </p>  <p>  The research is being undertaken by NUIG and comprises a quantitative and qualitative methodology. The quantitative aspect is based on a unique database, created by extracting key information on every Section 12 case on record in Tusla for the 12 month period from 1 July 2016-to the end of June, 2017. </p>  <p>  The qualitative aspect of NUIG's research involves interviews with social workers and key Tusla personnel involved in applications for Emergency Care Orders, to identify the factors contributing to practice decisions at this point. </p>  <p>  The research report will integrate the two methodological approaches to identify key findings. I expect the report to be finalised by the end of June. Any relevant findings will be taken into consideration in the review of the Child Care Act that is currently under way in my Department. </p></reply>

I understand that the complaint related to an incident in November 2016 involving the child.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the legislation, the Ombudsman for Children issued a statement to the Board in October 2018 under Section 13(6) of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. The Board decided to seek legal assistance in relation to the Ombudsman's statement and it subsequently responded to the Ombudsman in November 2018.</p>  <p>  Separately, civil legal proceedings were initiated on behalf of the child. In light of this, the Ombudsman for Children decided to discontinue his investigation. I understand that this would be normal practice when court proceedings are commenced.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the discontinuation of the Ombudsman's investigation is in line with Section 11(1) of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 (as amended) and arises from the decision to initiate civil legal proceedings, rather than from any action taken by the Board of Oberstown. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-13a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021300076#WRB01400"><p>The Commission submitted a Fourth Interim Report in December of last year. In it the Commission advised that it would not be able to issue its final report within the previously agreed time frame.  It requested an extension of one year in order to complete its work in full. </p><p>The Government agreed to this extension request and the Commission is now due to submit its final report by February 2020.  </p><p>In making their case for an extension, the Commission outlined the sheer scale of the work involved in investigating the matters set out under its terms of reference.</p><p>Up to December 2018, the Confidential Committee of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission had met with 519 former residents or others with connections to the institutions under investigation. When the Commission requested the extension, it indicated that there were still 26 individuals awaiting hearings.  </p><p>The terms of reference envisaged that the Confidential Committee would have concluded its meetings and completed its report of this aspect of its work within 18 months of commencement.  Clearly there were more people than anticipated that wished to meet the Confidential Committee.  I believe that as far as possible this needed to be accommodated.</p><p>In its report the Commission acknowledges the extensive material provided by the Department of Health and my own Department.  While the report states that the first tranche of discovery was delivered in March 2017, the Commission has acknowledged that this is incorrect and in fact the discovery of records commenced in February 2016.</p><p>This involved considering over 340,000 inactive files.  730,000 individual pages were digitised and reviewed for relevance.  My Department has delivered over 1000 digitised files to the Commission.</p><p>The Commission has reported that it is painstakingly analysing these and matching them with the records from the institutions.  Their report predicts that &ldquo;This should provide as comprehensive an account as is possible of the pathways of the children concerned&rdquo;.</p><p>This is reassuring and significant.  Hopefully, we will learn in some detail what happened to mothers and to the children who were born in the Mother and Baby Homes.</p><p>These children are now adults in their middle age and older.  They want answers and they want them soon.  I expect that the careful comprehensive and extensive analysis will deliver these answers in the form of robust findings in twelve months&rsquo; time. </p><p>While I am disappointed with the delay I believe that not granting the extension would have led the Commission to submit incomplete reports.  That would not be in anyone&rsquo;s interest. </p><p>I am pleased that the Commission will submit a detailed report on burials arrangements for people who died in these institutions by 15th March.  </p><p>It is tragic that this is a very real element of what we need to know about what happened in Mother and Baby Homes.  We have committed to finding out and that is the next chapter that we will deal with in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Any suggestion that this conversation, or any conversation between myself and the reviewers, in some way expanded upon, or amended the terms of reference of the Operational Review of Oberstown Children Detention Campus is incorrect.  </p>  <p>  I always take any opportunity presented to me to listen to and reflect on diverse views on youth justice issues in my role as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. I was interested to hear the views of an international expert such as Professor Hardwicke on a number of broader policy issues, but no part of my conversation was intended to agree, alter or broaden the terms of reference that had been set by the Board.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that the Board of Management of Oberstown commissioned the Operational Review. The Board of Management decided the terms of reference. It would therefore be inappropriate for me or any of the officials in my Department to interfere with the agreements entered into by the Board and independent parties.</p></reply>

This resulted in 85 applications being approved for the creation of 1,950 new places nationwide: of these, 697 were 0-3 places, and 1,253 were ECCE places.</p><p>In addition to this, &euro;0.76m was allocated for the creation of new school age childcare places. This resulted in 45 applications being approved for the creation of 807 new school age childcare places nationwide.</p><p>In 2019, I am pleased to have secured a total Capital budget of &euro;9.606m for Early Years. Much of it will be targeted towards the creation of new places, but some will focus on quality and supporting the sector to meet regulatory requirements.</p><p>Of the &euro;9.606m, &euro;4.231m has been allocated under the 2019 Early Learning and Care Capital programme for the creation of new early learning and care places for 0-3 year olds. Individual grants of up to &euro;50,000 will be made available to early learning and care providers under the measure.</p><p>&euro;1m has been allocated for the creation of new school age childcare places. Individual grants of up to &euro;20,000 will be made available under the measure. </p><p>The application window for the Capital programmes is set to open from 25th February to 27th March 2019.</p><p>It is not possible to provide an accurate figure as to the amount of new early learning and care and school age childcare places that will be created under this year's capital programmes, before the application and appraisal processes have taken place. However, I hope and expect that this year's capital allocation will build on the good work and progress achieved in previous years, and as always I anticipate that there will be great interest in the funding.</p><p>I would urge any interested providers to contact Pobal or their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) with any questions they may have about this year's Early Learning and Care and School Age Capital programmes.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-13a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021300076#WRB02400"><p>I strongly support Tusla&rsquo;s important work. I have secured an additional &euro;110m for the Agency since becoming Minister with the intention of securing permanent staff resources.</p>  <p>  I am aware that Tusla has been unable to meet its additional whole time equivalent target each year since its establishment in 2014.  The failure to meet its targets include the reality that there is a limited supply of social workers in Ireland and this has contributed to making the achievement of these targets very challenging.</p>  <p>  With regard to the number of vacant posts, Tusla has informed me that 320 posts are currently accepted by candidates and a further 569 approved permanent and temporary posts are at various stages of the recruitment process in various grade categories. In this context and to ensure continuity of service, Tusla uses agency staff. I understand at end December 2018, Tusla had 499 agency staff and 226 of these were social workers.</p>  <p>  I remain very concerned by the growth in expenditure on temporary agency staff in recent years and I have communicated this to Tusla. Notwithstanding this, given the front line nature of Tusla&rsquo;s services, it is accepted that agency staff will always be required. </p>  <p>  In a sense the need may have grown somewhat in recent years with the significant increase in referrals, new legislation with regard to mandatory reporting and the development of new services.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that all agency staff are actively encouraged to apply for Tusla&rsquo;s rolling campaigns for temporary and permanent positions across all grades. However, it must be acknowledged that some individuals prefer the flexibility of agency work.</p>  <p>  Recruitment and retention of social workers and residential social care workers for special care are two of the biggest challenges for Tusla.</p>  <p>  There are only 200-250 social work graduates each year. It is a very competitive labour market with a variety of services recruiting such as geriatric services, disability, mental health and of course child and family services. While there are many more social care graduates each year it is a small cohort that is willing to work in the particularly challenging environment of special care.</p>  <p>  In this context, Tusla continues to take a proactive approach to recruitment with the use of bespoke campaigns, visiting campuses in Ireland and abroad, personally engaging with students registering their interest in Tusla, assisting applicants with CORU registration and running rolling recruitment campaigns.</p>  <p>  With regard to the supply of social workers, Tusla recently participated in a meeting hosted by my Department with key social work education stakeholders to influence the future supply of key personnel such as social workers. The first area to be examined will be social work student placements with a view to supporting the provision of more training places.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Tusla has also focussed on recruiting supporting grades such as clerical administration staff to ensure social workers can focus on their core tasks. I understand Tusla&rsquo;s forthcoming Multi-annual Strategic Workforce Plan will build on this further over the coming years. The Plan will identify the future composition of Tusla&rsquo;s workforce and I expect this plan will provide the basis for the establishment of achievable recruitment targets once it has been piloted in one or two service areas.</p>  <p>  In December 2018, Tusla employee turnover for all grades was 5.07% versus 6.68% for the same period in 2017. This reflects the recent work Tusla has undertaken to address retention issues. It is expected that a robust retention strategy will also form a pillar of the forthcoming workforce plan&rsquo;s implementation to reduce the turnover rate further and ensure better outcomes for Tusla&rsquo;s total whole time equivalent staff.</p></reply>

I have published all four reports. </p>  <p>  The Commission submitted its Fourth Interim Report in December of last year. In it the Commission advised that it would not be able to issue its final report within the previously agreed time frame and requested an extension of one year to allow it to complete its work in full. Government has agreed to this extension request and the Commission is now due to complete its work by February 2020.</p>  <p>  In my view the public interest, and most importantly the interest of former residents, is best served by facilitating the Commission to conduct the comprehensive analysis required to make accurate and robust findings on the extensive range of sensitive issues before it.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the terms of reference for the Commission envisages multiple lines of inquiry relating to a number of quite different institutions over a period of more than three quarters of a century.</p>  <p>  When I met with Judge Yvonne Murphy I was reassured by the Commission's absolute commitment to establish the full facts of what happened to women and children in these institutions. </p>  <p>  I accept that the Commission is using its best endeavours to conclude the investigation as quickly as possible. The Chair wants to conclude matters, and I know the Deputies in the House want the same.  </p>  <p>  It is clear that the Commission is seeking to collate and analyse information on these institutions at a level of detail that has never been done before. This will greatly assist public understanding and hopefully assist individual citizens in relation to their personal story and experience. </p>  <p>  If a decision had been made not to grant the extension sought, the Commission would effectively be obliged to submit incomplete reports this month. </p>  <p>  I am of the view that while the delay is disappointing, there were strong public interest considerations in favour of granting the extension sought.  I recommended the granting of the extension of one year to bring certainty to the time frame and to facilitate the production of the comprehensive analysis and information envisaged in the terms of reference.  </p>  <p>  The Commission has undertaken to submit its report on burial arrangements for people who died in these institutions by 15th March.  </p></reply>

In late 2016, my Department secured additional funding to ensure that all 13 existing ABC sites remained in contract to the end of December 2017. </p>  <p>  With the closure of The Atlantic Philanthropies operations in Ireland, DCYA is now the sole funder of the ABC Programme.  In last year&rsquo;s budget, further funding was secured to maintain the existing ABC Programme up to the end of 2018. As of 31st December 2018 &euro;38.7m has been invested jointly by the co-funders to the ABC Programme (&euro;14.9m from Atlantic and &euro;23.8m from DCYA). A national evaluation of the ABC programme was carried out by the Centre for Effective Services (CES) and the published reports are now available on the DCYA website.   </p>  <p>  In November 2017, my Department initiated a process, in consultation with key ABC Programme stakeholders, to consider options for sustaining the work of the ABC Programme within a new vision for a community based prevention and early intervention programme from 2019 and beyond. Following these consultations, the decision was taken to transfer the current ABC Programme to Tusla, from September 2019 as part of the national Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme (PPFS).</p>  <p>  A working group was established in May 2018 to support the transition into this new national structure that can build on the achievements to date in both the ABC and PPFS Programmes, and strengthen Tusla&rsquo;s prevention and early intervention operations. As part of this national structure, it will take a renewed focus on addressing child poverty and inform the delivery of prevention and early intervention initiatives, improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland. </p>  <p>  Embedding the ABC programme and the learning from same within a wider infrastructure is key to strengthening local community based responses. It should also be recognised that the learning from the ABC and a range of other prevention programmes has been taken on by the What Works Programmes led by my Department. This is a programme that looks at enhancing quality and capacity building in the area of prevention and early intervention to effect change at systems level. It focuses on the area of information, evidence, capacity and quality development.</p>  <p>  Moving on both of these fronts: locally, through strengthening the ABC and PPFS programmes; and nationally, through the What Works initiative, is crucial in us embedding and transferring best practice in a strategic and sustainable way. </p></reply>

The measures announced as part of Budget 2019 formed part of a trend in continued growth in childcare investment bringing the total increase to 117% over 4 years. </p><p>My Department offers a number of programmes to support low and middle income families. These include:</p><p><b>Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE): </b></p><p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is a free pre-school programme available to all children within the eligible age range. From September 2018, all children meeting the minimum age requirement of 2 years and 8 months are eligible for a full two programme years. It provides children with a formal early learning experience prior to commencing primary school. The programme is provided three hours per day, five days per week, 38 weeks per year over the two years. </p><p><b>Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP): </b></p><p>These programmes provide childcare funding support, targeting low income families, in community childcare services and private childcare services, relative to the status of the parent/s with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. They are available to children from six months to 15 years of age. For example, a parent in receipt of One Parent Family Payment may receive a maximum of &euro;145 per week per child towards childcare fees. </p><p><b>Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) Programmes: </b></p><p>These programmes provide childcare funding support for parents participating in eligible Education and Training Boards /Solas vocational training courses, Community Employment (CE) programmes, or returning to employment The maximum subsidy provided is &euro;145 per child per week. These subsidies are available for children up to 15 years of age. </p><p>-  <b>After-School Child Care Scheme</b><b>(ASCC)</b>- provides afterschool care for primary school children for certain categories of working parents and parents on Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection employment programmes (not including Community Employment).</p><p>- <b>Childcare Education and Training Support  (CETS) </b>- provides childcare to certain training course participants on courses provided by the Education and Training Boards (ETB, formerly FAS and VEC) and Secondary Schools.</p><p>-  <b>Community Employment Childcare (CEC) </b>- provides per-school (PS) and after-school (AS) childcare for children of parents who are participating in Community Employment schemes.</p><p><b>Universal Subsidy (CCSU): </b></p><p>As part of its plan to make childcare more affordable, my Department introduced a universal subvention payment from September 2017. This subsidy is available for all parents who are not in receipt of any other childcare subsidy for children aged from 6 months to the first eligible point of entry to the ECCE programme (approximately 3 years of age).</p><p><b>Community Childcare Subvention Resettlement (CCSR): </b></p><p>This programme provides up to 60 weeks of childcare support on a part-time basis to Programme Refugees to support their resettlement and integration into Irish society, up to 5 days per week for children aged 0 &ndash; 5 years and for primary school going children during the school holidays. The parents are not charged a fee.</p><p><b>Community Childcare Subvention Resettlement (Transitional) (CCSR(T)): </b>As part of the &ldquo;Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; an Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rdquo; the DCYA provides access to free childcare on a part-time and sessional basis for pre-school children (ages 0 &ndash; 5 years) and primary school children during the school holidays of families experiencing homelessness. In addition, a daily meal is provided for each child.  The parents are not charged a fee. </p><p>Further to the above, the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme continues and the Scheme will launch this October, with payments commencing in November. An external IT contractor is working with officials from DCYA and Pobal to develop the Scheme&rsquo;s supporting IT system and this project is on schedule.</p><p>The Childcare Support Act, which is the legislative basis for the scheme, was signed into law by the President in July. Detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines are currently being finalised. On the 20th of December I also signed regulations which will provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services. These regulations will come into force on the 18th of February and will allow these services to participate in the Scheme from the very start.</p><p>As part of Budget 2019, the income threshold levels used for assessing the level of subsidy to which a parent may be entitled were raised. The lower threshold was raised from &euro;22,700 to &euro;26,000, meaning that more families will avail of the maximum income-related subsidies.</p><p>A comprehensive programme of communications and training is planned throughout 2019 in advance of the launch of the scheme in October and I look forward to engaging with all of the stakeholders as the launch date approaches.</p></reply>

I agree with the Deputy that this organisation provides valuable services to children and families in the South Dublin area. </p><p>The Deputy previously tabled questions in relation to this service. Since that time, I have met with Minister Shane Ross, representatives from the Cottage Home and representatives from Tusla the Child and Family Agency.</p><p>At this meeting, all stakeholders were provided with the opportunity to express their concerns. I subsequently raised the issue of the future funding of the Cottage Home with Tusla. </p><p>I wrote to Tusla requesting clarification on budgetary projections for spending on family support services in the Dublin South/South East/Wicklow area, and any shortfalls in Tusla's budget which would hinder the Agency in meeting identified needs.</p><p>Tusla has informed me that it does not have any additional funding to support this service. </p><p>The Cottage Home is located in the Tusla Dublin South/ Dublin South East/Wicklow area. Tusla has fully committed its funds for family support services in this area. As a result, there is no budget available to fund the Cottage Home Family Support Service, which has never received funding from Tusla. However, Tusla funds the residential service run by this organisation. In 2018, Tusla funding to the Cottage Home&rsquo;s residential service came to a total of &euro;1.6m.</p><p>Tusla has advised that it is currently compiling a Commissioning Plan for services in the area. Tusla&rsquo;s commissioning approach involves looking at the priority needs within each Area, to ensure that all resources allocated will enable Tusla to achieve the best possible outcomes for children. </p><p>Tusla&rsquo;s overall aim, as cited in its Commissioning Strategy, is to ensure total resources are used:</p><p>&ldquo;in the most beneficial, effective, efficient, equitable, proportionate and sustainable manner in order to improve outcomes for children&rdquo;.</p><p>Tusla has planned a stakeholder event as part of its commissioning process in Dublin South/ Dublin South East/Wicklow in the coming weeks. Tusla has informed me that it will invite the Cottage Home to be involved in the process. </p><p>Tusla has examined a number of options to source funding for this service, while maintaining existing funded services, but has been unsuccessful to date. Should the service have to close, Tusla will work with the Cottage Home to ensure it can provide the required alternative services to children and families. </p></reply>

Foster parents can be relatives (relative care) or people who are unrelated to the family (general foster care).  As of November 2018, there were 1,583 children in relative care.  There were 3,990 children were in general foster care.  Tusla reports that, at end November, these figures included 398 children in private foster care.

A number of meetings have taken place between myself and Scouting Ireland during the course of 2018 and in 2019 to date.  Most recently I met with representatives of Scouting Ireland on 28 January to be updated on the Independent barrister&rsquo;s report into issues surrounding an allegation of sexual assault by an adult volunteer against another adult volunteer.  My officials met with Scouting Ireland on 7 February to discuss the detail and actions taken in relation to the latest available figures on the allegations of abuse.  My officials are also being regularly updated on any internal policy changes. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, in May 2018, I appointed Ms Jillian van Turnhout, as an independent expert, to examine the governance and related issues within Scouting Ireland. In accordance with her Terms of Reference she was asked to provide me with a clear assessment of Scouting Ireland's governance arrangements.  Ms van Turnhout submitted her final report on the Review of Scouting Ireland to me on 14 June 2018. The report contained a number of recommendations in the areas of safeguarding, management of the organisation, governance proposals and charities regulation.  </p>  <p>  Following the election of a new board at an EGM on 6 October 2018 and given the significant progress made by Scouting Ireland in terms of the implementation of the Jillian van Turnhout recommendations and in the essential governance changes committed to by the organisation, funding to Scouting Ireland has been restored until the end of April 2019.  </p>  <p>  I have requested that my officials continue to monitor the implementation of the outstanding recommendations over the coming months.  A further progress report detailing the implementation of the recommendations currently outstanding must be submitted to me by 31st March 2019 in advance of the April 2019 AGM.  When I receive all relevant reports, I will be in a position to consider if Scouting Ireland has fully achieved the strong governance required of an organisation in receipt of public funding which would allow for consideration of the full restoration of funding.</p></reply>

The legislation supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions. A Regulatory Impact Analysis was conducted as part of the ACS development.</p>  <p>  The ACS, when introduced, will represent a major landmark for all children and families in Ireland, and especially for lower income families and lone parents. International reports have stated that ACS will significantly address affordability for lower income families, with analysis showing that Ireland will, for example, change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for childcare for lone parents, to 11th position. This will also have strong financial benefits for the childcare sector.</p>  <p>  The scheme will also increase accessibility, in particular, by providing a coherent and progressive system of income-related subsidies.  By contrast, under the existing targeted schemes, subsidies are dependent on parents being in receipt of certain social welfare payments or a medical card or participating in particular training programmes. </p>  <p>  Consistent with enhancing accessibility, the scheme is designed to be flexible.  It acknowledges that childcare needs differ widely across different families. It reflects the fact that parents and providers currently agree the childcare arrangements, based on a combination of parental need and what the service can reasonably provide.  Under the scheme, parents and providers can continue to agree childcare requirements amongst themselves.  The scheme will then pay subsidies towards the cost of the agreed childcare arrangements up to a maximum number of hours per week.  It will remain a matter for childcare providers themselves to set their own fees and determine their own admission policies.</p>  <p>  Subsidies under the ACS will be paid subject to a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the scheme will contain rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is absent or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  These rules will be child-centred, fair and proportionate, clear and consistent.  They will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  They will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances. At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.  </p>  <p>  A comprehensive programme of information, training and supports for providers, parents and other stakeholders will shortly be rolled out.  Training for providers will be tailored and timed to suit the needs of busy childcare providers, and will include full details of Scheme rules. It is hoped that the extensive information and training will reassure providers re the reasonableness of the scheme, part of which was informed by focus groups and user testing with providers and parents. Details of the information and training programme will be communicated in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

There were clear improvements needed in the standards of management and accountability within Tusla's Cavan Monaghan area.  I raised this with Tusla's Board and asked them to consider the steps it would take in terms of a management response and in terms of changing the culture of the agency.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised me that the Cavan Monaghan area is the subject of a comprehensive service improvement plan and is making improvements in governance, the management of current and retrospective cases, data protection and the management of risk.</p>  <p>  The key issues raised in the Tribunal's report were already identified in the HIQA statutory investigation report, carried out at my direction and published in June 2018. The strategic action plan published by Tusla will address these concerns across all 17 of Tusla's service areas.  The plan identifies a member of the senior management team to lead on each of the nine improvement themes, and includes a timeframe for completion for each of the 46 actions, covering the period 2019/2020. The strategic action plan is available on Tusla's website.</p>  <p>  This strategic action plan encompasses the improvement and strengthening of the referrals process, the more timely and effective screening of referrals for risk, the management of retrospective cases, the prioritisation methodology of unallocated cases, a national performance and accountability framework, and improving governance. </p>  <p>  This strategic action plan is subject to oversight by Tusla's Board.  In addition, I have established an Expert Assurance Group (EAG) to monitor and advise me on the implementation of the recommendations from the HIQA report.  </p>  <p>  The EAG, my Department and Tusla's Board will continue to support and advise the Tusla Executive on its implementation of all actions addressing the serious issues identified by the Disclosures Tribunal and the report of HIQA's statutory investigation.</p></reply>

These Regulations will enable school-age childcare services to register with Tusla in time to take part in the Affordable Childcare Scheme when it opens later this year. This will make school-age childcare more affordable for many parents.</p>  <p>  The regulation of school-age childcare is an important measure to secure children's health, safety and welfare. The Affordable Childcare Scheme will only be available to services that are registered with Tusla, a critical quality assurance measure associated with the provision of State funding. </p>  <p>  Whilst the regulations are to be welcomed for their part in improving the affordability and quality of school age childcare, I am conscious of the impact they may have on providers, and I have made provisions accordingly. With regard to registration, existing services will have 6 months in which to apply for registration with Tusla if they are also registered as pre-school services. Existing services that only provide school-age childcare will have 3 months in which to apply for registration with Tusla. A person who proposes to set up a new service will be required to apply for registration at least 3 months before commencing the service.</p>  <p>  The Regulations, including the minimum ratio requirement of 1 adult to 12 children, were developed following the advice of the School Age Childcare Standards Working Group, which in 2018 submitted proposals for school-age childcare standards. Membership of the Group included representatives from across the school-age childcare sector. In developing their proposals, the Working Group reviewed international evidence and practice. The Group was reconvened for a further meeting with officials  in September 2018, during drafting of the Regulations, for consultation specifically on the adult-child ratio and outdoor space requirements. Their work followed that of a previous Expert Group led by the Department of Justice and Equality in 2005 which at that time recommended a ratio of 1 adult to 8 children.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that some services may require additional time to adjust to the minimum ratio of 1 adult to 12 children. Officials in my Department have had discussions on this issue recently with a number of sector representatives. As a result of these consultations, I have decided to extend the commencement date of the minimum ratio requirements by six months. This will mean that existing services will be given until 18th August to become fully compliant with these specific requirements, irrespective of the date on which they register with Tusla. I propose to sign the necessary Regulations to give this effect in advance of 18th February. The Regulations are subject to the consent of the Ministers for Education and Skills and Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  School age childcare services will continue to be eligible for the existing funding schemes (CCSP, TEC, etc) until the Affordable Childcare Scheme will replace them. Capital funding of &euro;1 million will also be made available to support the expansion of an existing school age childcare service or to set up a new school age childcare facility where demand is currently not being met at a local level. Services may be standalone or part of an early learning and care service.</p>  <p>  Public consultation is planned this summer in advance of the development of a fuller set of Regulations that will replace the initial Regulations and cover additional quality objectives. The Comprehensive Regulations will set out minimum requirements for the health, safety, welfare and development of children attending school-age childcare services. A key priority will be the development of an appropriate qualification for the school-age childcare workforce. First 5, which was published in November 2018, committed to requiring that all school-age childcare staff hold a minimum qualification, with the level of qualification to be determined by the end of 2019.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has the lead role in co-ordinating strategies on poverty and the National Plan for Social Inclusion, but reducing poverty among children and others, also involves the Department of the Department of Education and the Department of Health, among others. We are adopting a cross Government approach which is for the benefit of children.</p>  <p>  This work  is reflected through the comprehensive policy framework Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, led by my Department, and underpinned by actions which are making a real difference on the ground for children, including those most vulnerable.  </p>  <p>    The &lsquo;Whole-of-Government Approach to Tackling Child poverty&rsquo; paper, published in 2017, involved the active input of the National Advisory Council for children and young people and other key non-governmental organisations.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, the Government set a child-specific poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two-thirds on 2011 levels by 2020.   </p>  <p>  This target has been actioned through a whole-of-Government approach.  The plan identifies six priority area for actions, namely: 1) providing universal access to general practitioner care for those under 18 years; 2) reducing the cost of education; 3) housing; 4) affordable childcare; 5) labour activation; and 6) the provision of in-work benefits. My own focus has been on affordable childcare.</p>  <p>  In my portfolio as Minister for Children, I have had the opportunity to secure significant public investment in high quality, affordable childcare and early learning.  The annual investment has increased by 117% since 2015.  Our early years schemes operate on policy that provide the highest level of subsidization to families with the lowest incomes. </p>  <p>  I believe it is important that we have progress indicators that accurately reflect the policy interventions and the improvements they are delivering.  </p>  <p>  The latest data from the 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) shows a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate for children, which decreased from 10.9% in 2016 to 8.8% in 2017, a reduction of just over 2 percentage points, and is the second highest reduction in the rate since the collection of SILC data began in 2004. This equates to a drop of 24,000 children living in consistent poverty over that 12-month period.</p>  <p>  I have continually emphasised the importance of eradicating child poverty and hunger and that collective and cross-sectoral action is critical in ensuring policy impact.  </p>  <p>   In November 2018, I hosted a high level workshop focusing on child poverty  which deliberated on how the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework could help to end child poverty and hunger in Ireland.  The workshop attended by senior officials from all Government Departments represented at the BOBF Consortium, the BOBF Advisory Council, ESRI and other research centres, the civil society and academia resonated the importance of eradicating child poverty and hunger as well as the need for cross-Government work to achieve this. </p>  <p>  This cross-Government approach will continue and we will redouble our efforts to continue with the progress made in the recent years. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to meet with the Chief Executive of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance in the coming weeks to discuss this campaign and how we can continue to focus on and address these important issues. </p></reply>

I am pleased to confirm that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency will receive &euro;25.3 million for these services this year.</p>  <p>  Tusla has responsibility for the provision of funding, co-ordination and support to 59 organisations nationally that deliver a range of services to victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.</p>  <p>  22 of these organisations provide emergency refuge and emergency non-refuge accommodation to victims of domestic violence and their children, with a total of 155 family units of emergency accommodation - 145 in emergency refuges and 10 in safe homes. This figure of 155 units includes 9 units of accommodation in the Rathmines Refuge, Dublin which was temporarily closed for essential refurbishment works. This facility is expected to re-open as a domestic violence refuge in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  There are challenges to be addressed in ensuring that there is an appropriate configuration of spaces available to all women and children who require emergency refuge accommodation. At all times, Tusla seeks to achieve the optimum use of specialist emergency accommodation while also focusing on prevention and effective community based services to avoid, in so far as possible, the need for use of refuges by vulnerable women and families.    </p>  <p>  A strong focus for Tusla is on improved geographical access to services and the provision of additional emergency refuge capacity nationally. Tusla is progressing its planning around additional refuge developments in areas of under-provision to improve access to safe emergency accommodation for victims of domestic violence. </p>  <p>  It is important that the needs of victims of domestic violence are met in the best way possible, with due attention to the quality, accessibility, and outcome of services. I am committed to supporting the Agency in meeting the needs of individuals who experience domestic violence.

Tusla has advised that 10,811 online child protection and welfare reports were received through the webportal to the end of 2018.  </p>  <p>  Tusla collates data on overall referrals and mandated reports, which form part of the total of all referrals.  These are inclusive of referrals received via the web portal.  Tusla also publishes data on the numbers of open cases which have been allocated a social worker.  I understand that, as a case can be the subject of a number of referrals, the data on the allocation of social workers relates to open cases only, and not individual referrals.</p>  <p>  All referrals to Tusla Social Work Services are screened as they are received, irrespective of the source.  The first consideration when receiving a referral is the immediate safety of the child. </p>  <p>  Monthly referrals data, which are provisional as this data is validated quarterly only, indicates that there were at least 52,779 referrals received up to November 2018.  Overall Tusla received approx. 5,000 referrals each month from all sources in 2018, comprising around 40% child abuse concerns and 60% welfare concerns.  The number of mandated reports typically represents between 20 and 25% of all referrals received in a given month.  </p>  <p>  At the end of November 2018, Tusla has indicated that there were 6,046 cases without an allocated social worker out of a total of 26,007 open cases. </p>  <p>  Tusla introduced the web portal for the reporting of concerns in January 2018, following the commencement the previous December of the mandatory reporting provisions of the Children First Act 2015.  The portal is not the only means for a report to be submitted although it is considered the preferred method, particularly for reports from mandatory reporters.  </p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the decision on whether a report is a mandated report or not rests with the person making the report.  It is then Tusla's role to screen and assess these. When a referral or mandated report is examined in detail by social workers, it may be determined that it requires a social work intervention or it may be more appropriate other interventions or services, such as a family or community based support.  It is also possible that Tusla is aware of the case and appropriate actions are already underway.  Data on activity and performance is published regularly on Tusla's website, www.tusla.ie.</p></reply>

This is an increase of &euro;1.5 million over 2018 funding. </p>  <p>  In financial terms, funding for the Family Resource Programme, is now the highest it has been for almost a decade. </p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres are located throughout the country and provide services to areas designated as disadvantaged. In the 2019 Performance Statement for Tusla, I have emphasised that additional funding provided this year is to support and develop existing Family Resource Centres.</p>  <p>  Throughout the country I have seen at first hand the work of Family Resource Centres in transforming lives. I secured additional funding for Family Resources Centres in 2018 and I am pleased to be able to provide further support again this year. I do recognise that Family Resource Centres, like other services, are experiencing significant cost pressures due to rising rents, utility and wage costs. </p>  <p>  Decisions made by Tusla in relation to the funding of individual Family Resource Centres have regard to location, size and catchment area of each centre. The process aims to be equitable and transparent. </p>  <p>  All decisions are made to ensure available resources are applied in improving outcomes for children and families in the most equitable, proportionate and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  Family Resource Centres form an integral part of Tusla's family support and prevention services. Through its local office network, Tusla provides additional funding to individual Family Resource Centres involved in the delivery of family support and prevention programmes.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the further development of Family Resource Centres and I will continue to seek funding for them in future budget discussions.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of policyholders.</p>  <p>  The above said, however, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants. In this regard, the initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  </p>  <p>  The second phase of the CIWG, under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, culminated in the issuing of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018.  This report acknowledges that many of the difficulties being faced by business are also impacting upon by community, voluntary and charitable organisations.  It makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, detailed in an Action Plan with agreed timelines for implementation.</p>  <p>  The most recent Progress Update was published last November and shows that 18 of the 19 actions points arising up to end of Q3 2018 have been completed.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the next quarterly Progress Update will issue by the end of this month and I understand that the vast majority of the total of 26 action points which were due for completion during 2018 overall have been done.  I am confident that any outstanding action points will be completed in the coming months, along with the three remaining action points with deadlines set for various quarters throughout 2019.</p>  <p>  The actions implemented to date cut across a number of different areas and include:</p>  <p>  - The publication of by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the &ldquo;Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo; </p>  <p>  - The Law Reform Commission confirming that the subject of caps on damages for personal injuries litigation is included in its draft Fifth Programme of Law Reform</p>  <p>  - Sections 8 &amp;amp; 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 have been amended to ensure defendants are appropriately notified of a claim having been submitted against their policy and to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, respectively</p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commencing the collection of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system</p>  <p>  - The Courts Service confirming that they will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the CIWG will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.

Indeed, the Department of Finance has been to the forefront in assessing the impact of Brexit on our economy- commissioning joint research with the ESRI on the issue, including before the actual referendum. What is clear from this research and other studies is that the harder the Brexit the more negative the impact on Ireland. This analysis has focused on assessing the impact on the overall economy along with and identifying the sectors which are most exposed. These studies do not provide a detailed analysis by region. However, they do show that the most negative effects are likely to be felt in the agri-food and indigenous manufacturing sectors. </p>  <p>  While my Department&rsquo;s central economic and fiscal planning scenario remains an orderly exit involving the UK leaving with a transition arrangement in place, the risk of a disorderly exit has increased in recent weeks. As part of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing contingency planning for a no deal Brexit, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s initial assessment of the economic and fiscal impact of &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit was released on the 29th January 2019. In a disorderly exit, while in aggregate terms, the economy is likely to continue expanding, the pace of growth would be lower than is currently expected. </p>  <p>  The initial assessment by my Department suggests that the level of economic activity will be around 4&frac14; percentage points lower than our existing trajectory over the medium-term and will be around 6 percentage points lower compared to a &lsquo;no Brexit&rsquo; scenario. This aggregate assessment incorporates an even larger impact on economic activity in labour-intensive sectors such as agri-food and indigenous small and medium-sized enterprises. </p>  <p>  This assessment is based an initial application of the latest UK estimates from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the UK equivalent of our ESRI. The Department and ESRI are preparing a more comprehensive update of their original work and the results will be published later this quarter. This output will be incorporated in the Stability Programme Update due to be published in April. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that such estimates may not capture the full impact, and the figures may be conservative. Indeed, the impact in certain exposed sectors and regions will be worse than the average.</p>  <p>  Of course, it is important to point out that Ireland is facing the challenge of Brexit in a robust economic position, with the highest GDP growth in Europe and record employment levels. In addition, exports, job creation, inflation and public debt indicators are all strong. This will provide a stable platform for the external challenges that lie ahead.</p>  <p>  Since the referendum result in 2016, we have been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy so that we have the capacity to deal with adverse economic shocks. This includes building up our Fiscal Buffers &ndash; by balancing our books and reducing our debt burden - and establishing the Rainy Day Fund. The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy and the 10-year National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  In addition, recent budgets have introduced specific initiatives, such as loan supports for agri-businesses and SMEs, aimed at supporting those businesses most affected by Brexit. The Government will continue to work to improve the business environment &ndash; to make it more competitive, to assist exporters to diversify markets, and to provide better infrastructure. That is the key to addressing the type of economic uncertainties which arise from Brexit. Longer-term, we need to mitigate against the potential of regulatory divergence between the UK and EU standards given its potential impact on trade and investment and the competitiveness of our businesses. We will therefore be working to minimise this impact and to ensure a level playing field.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. </p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) opened for parental preferences on the 10th December 2018 for 12 primary schools to be established in 2019, including the school referred to by the Deputy and closed on the 15th January 2019. My Department are currently preparing assessment reports for the NSEG and it is anticipated that the successful patrons will be announced in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The assessment reports, including details on the number of parental preferences received for each of the areas and the NSEG recommendations, will be made available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  The school was announced as an 8 classroom school and will open with a single stream junior infant class in September 2019 in suitable interim accommodation. A planning application for temporary accommodation has been lodged in this regard.</p>  <p>  In relation to the permanent school site, my Department will be examining all potential suitable site options to serve the relevant area. A decision will then be made as part of the site acquisition process in relation to an appropriate site for the school to which the Deputy refers and will be confirmed at a later date.</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,318 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). </p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers within the education sector. For example, a teacher hired in September 2011 will see their salary increase from &euro;45,200 in September 2018 to &euro;53,062 in September 2020 under the PSSA agreement and the 24 September agreement.</p>  <p>  These restorations for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

These initiatives are intended to be accessible to all learners. My Department does not directly fund scholarships for individuals or schools to attend workshops and programmes abroad. </p>  <p>  Music Generation was formed by a partnership between U2, Music Network, the International Funds for Ireland and the education sector has enabled a series of Music Education Partnerships (MEPs) to be established around the country on a phased basis to provide vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people. The intention was that the philanthropic contributions would fund 50% of the initiative in the early years of development with local Music Education Partners (ETBs and local authorities) providing the other 50%, and that programmes would be continued into the future with Exchequer funding when the philanthropic donations cease.</p>  <p>  Philanthropic funding for Phase 1 of Music Generation was phased out and the Department of Education and Skills has taken over 50% funding of Music Generation between 2014 and 2016, with the balance provided by partners in the local MEPs. In 2016 all funding for established Phase 1 Music Education Partnerships came from the DES and the local partnerships, without philanthropic support.</p>  <p>  Agreement was given for Phase 2 of Music Generation to proceed by the Department in 2016. Funded initially by philanthropic donations (U2 and The Ireland Funds) it involves the launch of up to 9 new Music Education Partnerships. These are initially being funded by philanthropic funding, including from U2, but will move, as for Phase 1, towards exchequer funding. </p>  <p>  On 7 December 2017, at the launch of the Creative Youth programme, An Taoiseach announced that Phase 3 of Music Generation would proceed in the coming years, funded entirely with exchequer funding.  This final phase will see Music Generation reach all areas of the country. </p>  <p>  Music Generation currently reaches over 41,000 children and young people annually. This number will increase annually as more MEPs are established and rollout. </p>  <p>  The Non-Mainstream Music Education Bursary is a DES funded initiative to provide additional funding to non-mainstream educational initiatives. The purpose of the scheme is to provide support by way of a cash grant, to established, smaller-scale, non-mainstream music education/community music initiatives with limited or no access to other forms of public funding. Grants are not intended for use on capital expenditure such as structural/building costs, but can be used for instruments. Award of the bursary is done based on published criteria. The scheme was first established in 2016 and continued in both 2017 and 2018. An announcement regarding the Bursary in 2019 will be made in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

In addition, an applicant must have four years residence in the State during the 8 years immediately preceding that period (in the case of an application based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the Act reduces this further period to 2 years during the preceding 4 years). </p>  <p>  Applicants must therefore establish to the Ministers satisfaction that they have been resident in the State for these periods in order to be eligible for naturalisation. To this end, applicants should submit evidence with their application verifying that they satisfy the residency requirements for naturalisation. Failure to do so could result in an application for naturalisation being deemed ineligible. </p>  <p>  Applicants should also note that compliance with the statutory conditions for naturalisation set out in the 1956 Act does not automatically mean that an applicant will be granted a certificate of naturalisation. This is because in cases where the statutory conditions for naturalisation have been satisfied the Minister nonetheless retains an absolute discretion as to whether to grant a certificate of naturalisation. </p>  <p>  It is therefore very important for applicants to note that any absences from the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding the date of their application could result in the Minister exercising his absolute discretion to refuse to grant a certificate of naturalisation notwithstanding that they may have satisfied the statutory conditions for same set out in the 1956 Act. Where applicants are absent from the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding the date of their application the policy of the Minister is to only grant a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied that the travel was demonstrably unavoidable or due to exceptional circumstances. Applicants who find themselves in this position should submit as much information as possible with their application to verify that any travel outside of the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding their application was unavoidable or due to exceptional circumstances. </p>  <p>  Every application for naturalisation is considered having regard to circumstances of the applicant, the statutory conditions for naturalisation set out in the 1956 Act and the Ministers policy on the need for applicants to be physically present in the State for the full duration of the year immediately preceding the date of application </p>  <p>  The applications for naturalisation in respect of the persons referred to by the Deputy have been reviewed and the position remains as stated in the original decision. The applicants were informed of this by letters dated 24 October 2018.</p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions for naturalisation prescribed in the Act.  </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.  </p></reply>

Processing times for other Visa Offices overseas and for Embassies will vary but are generally between 3 and 10 days at this time.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase in the number of visa applications across most categories of people wishing to come to Ireland for a variety of purposes.  Notwithstanding, processing times are still on a par with, and in many cases have been significantly improved upon, those of the same time last year.  </p>  <p>  More generally, there has been an improvement in processing times for visas in recent weeks.  It is expected that this will improve further in the coming weeks.  However, it should be noted that processing times in Visa Offices may vary having regard to seasonal demands, the volume of applications received, the particular merits of individual applications, their complexity, whether the need to investigate or enquire further, and the resources available.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.  This has included the assignment of additional staff to help process applications, and more generally the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  I am advised that this is making a difference to the point where processing times are generally within the administrative target set by INIS, these targets taking into account the time required to undertake essential checks. The targets themselves have not been adjusted to take account of the increased numbers of visa applications in certain locations.  The position in this regard is being kept under review, and will be monitored closely in the coming months.</p></reply>

In that regard, consultation is ongoing with the Office of the Attorney General, relevant Government Departments, State bodies and other stakeholders, and the European Commission.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the European Commission Notice to Stakeholders, as published on 18 January 2019, which sets out the consequences in the field of civil justice and private international law in the event that there is a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit.  That notice can be accessed at the following link:</p><p>EU Council Regulation 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (also known as the Brussels II bis or the Brussels IIa Regulation) provides for EU judicial co-operation and recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border matrimonial matters.  This will be affected by the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union since, absent a withdrawal agreement that covers these areas post-Brexit, the UK will essentially become a third country.  Among the areas of family law covered by this instrument are foreign divorce recognition, child abduction and custody of, and access to, children.</p><p>A person who is, or is likely to be, relying upon this Regulation in a cross-border family law case involving the UK on or after the withdrawal date of 29 March should consider seeking legal advice as to how the withdrawal may impact upon the circumstances of his or her particular case.</p><p>In some areas of family law, there are international conventions that will apply to proceedings involving Ireland and the UK and which will provide a substitute for the existing EU Regulation.  The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction will continue to apply as between Ireland and the UK.  The 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children will also continue to apply.</p><p>Insofar as the recognition in Ireland of divorces obtained in the UK is concerned, the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 sets out the circumstances in which a divorce granted in a non-EU jurisdiction on or after 2 October 1986 will be recognised.  Under section 5 of the 1986 Act, a divorce shall be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled at the date of the institution of the divorce proceedings.  Thus in a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit scenario, the UK will in effect become a non-EU jurisdiction and the basis for recognition in Ireland of divorces obtained in the UK will, under the 1986 Act as it now is,  become domicile as opposed to the current position under the relevant EU regulation, which is habitual residence. </p></reply>

The primary function of the PIU is to identify persons who require further examination by a competent authority.  </p>  <p>  The Regulations provide that PNR data shall not be processed in such a manner as to reveal a person&rsquo;s race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, sexual life or sexual orientation. </p>  <p>  The Regulations also provide that an assessment of passengers prior to their arrival in or departure from the State carried out against pre-determined criteria shall be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner. The pre-determined criteria must be targeted, proportionate and specific in nature, regularly reviewed and shall not, in any circumstances, be based on the factors referred to above, e.g., a person&rsquo;s race, ethnic origin, etc. </p>  <p>  The Regulations provide for the appointment to the PIU of a Data Protection Officer responsible for monitoring the processing of PNR data and for data protection safeguards under the Regulation and a Data Protection Officer has been duly appointed.  </p>  <p>  Regulation 15 provides that the Data Protection Commission is responsible for advising on and monitoring the application of the Regulations within the State with a view to protecting fundamental rights in relation to the processing of personal data. </p>  <p>  The Regulations provide for the exchange of PNR data with other Member States, Europol and third countries for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose details of any such exchanges. </p>  <p>  Finally, the PIU has also assumed responsibility for collecting and processing data obtained under the European Communities (Communication of Passenger Data) Regulations 2011 - this data is usually referred to as Advance Passenger Information (API). </p>  <p>  Under the 2011 Regulations, API data is collected to facilitate the operation and administration of the law concerning the entry into, presence in, departure and removal from the State of persons and for other specified persons. API data is used by members of the Department&rsquo;s Border Management Unit to facilitate them in their immigration control functions. </p></reply>

The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018) to enable the Director of the Decision Support Service to progress the preparation of the codes of practice as soon as the multi-disciplinary group submits its recommendations to the Director.   </p>  <p>  The remainder of the 2015 Act has not yet been commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the Decision Support Service has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020, the situation is being kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward.  </p>  <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.</p></reply>

In the case of patients in psychiatric facilities, the Mental Health Commission encourage the active involvement, from admission to discharge, of a resident and his/her family/carer or chosen advocate, where appropriate including the provision of adequate information.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Expert Group Review of the Mental Health Act 2001 in its 2015 Report recommended that there should be greater &lsquo;proactive encouragement for the patient at all stages to involve his/her family/carer and/or chosen advocate in the admission process and in the development of the care and treatment plan. </p>  <p>  However, it is important to point out that clinicians can only discuss details of a patient&rsquo;s condition and treatment with family members where the patient has specifically consented to the sharing of such information.</p>  <p>  Where consent is concerned, psychiatric care is treated no differently to any other medical speciality.  Whatever condition a patient suffers from, it is entirely a matter for the patient as to what his/her Doctor can disclose to family members.  The safeguarding of patient confidentiality is a fundamental principle of medical ethics which dates back to the Hippocratic Oath. Confidentiality is both a patient&rsquo;s right and a doctor&rsquo;s duty.</p>  <p>  Having said that, notwithstanding the fact that Doctors have a responsibility to protect their patient, there are circumstances where it may be necessary to disclose information about a patient where they are at serious risk of harm to themselves or others and this includes, for example, where a child or elderly person is at risk of violence or abuse. Medical Council guidelines specifically allow for this to happen and that course of action has always been available to Doctors.</p>  <p>  In the case outlined by the Deputy, the person in question can ask the treating clinician if the patient has refused consent to share treatment.  If still dissatisfied with the clinician&rsquo;s answer, the person can raise the matter with the hospital manager or the complaints officer in the hospital.</p></reply>

The afforestation scheme offers a fixed grant towards the costs, subject to the maximum laid down in the scheme&rsquo;s terms and conditions. In addition, annual premiums are payable to new forests which qualify for an afforestation grant for a maximum period of 15 years.</p>  <p>  There is no distinction between the rate paid to farmers, whether full or part-time, and non-farmers under the Programme as the aim is to make the afforestation scheme accessible to all landowners. It should be noted that the category of non-farmer includes those with an association with farming such as retired farmers, sons and daughters of farmers or other relatives who  have inherited land and wish to retain their connection with the land. For this reason, I am satisfied that the bulk of  forestry payments are paid to and remain in rural Ireland. </p></reply>

Brexit depending on the outcome has the potential to have a very significant impact on farmers and on the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  There are on-going discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties facing Ireland, and the assistance that might be required for its agriculture food and fishery sectors. </p>  <p>  I and my officials have been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts. The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors. We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and increased flexibility under State Aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves. </p></reply>

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers. My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.</p>  <p>  In 2017, I reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under 3 months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 &ndash; this has brought greater equity to the inspection fee regime. </p>  <p>  In 2018, live exports of cattle increased by over 30% to 246,000 head compared to the previous year. This change was driven by an increase in exports to other EU countries &ndash; particularly calf exports. This growth trend has increased into 2019, with live exports totalling 5,000 in the first four weeks of the year &ndash; a 25% increase on the same period in 2018. </p>  <p>  The live export market to third countries slowed in 2018 - in large part due to fluctuations in the Turkish Lira. The current restrictions in Turkey seek to reduce the pressure in its own domestic market. My Department will continue to engage with the Turkish authorities in an effort to see the resumption of live cattle trade at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>  <p>  New health certificates for the export of cattle to Libya were agreed in November 2018, which increase the range of cattle that can be exported there.  My Department is also engaging with the Egyptian authorities to secure the finalisation of agreement on three proposed health certs for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle.    In January of this year, my Department reached agreement with Qatar on a health cert for the export of sheep for slaughter.  I have extended an invitation to my Algerian counterpart to visit Ireland in early 2019. This follows earlier contact with Algeria, to try and reach agreement on revised and separate slaughter, fattening and breeding certs.</p>  <p>  Despite these many positive developments for live export markets, I am also well aware of the challenges faced by the sector, including transport capacity and lairage capacity at Cherbourg. My Department officials visited Cherbourg in September last year to discuss the capacity issue with French officials and local lairage owners. My officials continue to meet with ferry companies to explore new routes to continental Europe or the potential for carrying livestock on existing routes, and to ensure that the greatest facilitation possible is afforded to livestock exporters in the important Spring period.  The pending approval of a new ferry will contribute to addressing capacity issues.  </p>  <p>  In 2019  my Department will continue to facilitate growth in live exports, seeking out new markets and facilitating trade by reaching agreement on health certification. </p></reply>

It has also been done through direct contacts with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstroem, and by the Taoiseach at European Council and through his own direct contacts, including with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and French President Emmanuel Macron.

I also continue to stress that full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market. </p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations.  </p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the coverage deficits across the country. An Implementation Group is overseeing the implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. The Implementation Group meets on a quarterly basis and publishes quarterly progress reports on the implementation status of actions. </p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 published in February 2018, comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 had been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the inaugural National Stakeholder Forum 2017, an additional 23 new measures were identified for delivery in 2018. </p>  <p>  The outcome of discussions at the second Annual National Stakeholder Forum held in October 2018 informed preparation of the 2018 Annual Review report, which will be published shortly together with the 2019 Work Programme.</p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile phone and broadband blackspots various other initiatives are underway:</p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked together to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy within the Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  - ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas, including in County Kerry.</p></reply>

My Department has no statutory authority or function to intervene in the company&rsquo;s commercial decisions, nor in any decisions relating to the roll out and siting of infrastructure throughout Ireland by service providers operating in a liberalised market.</p>  <p>  For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements. </p></reply>

This is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. The map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services (BLUE/LIGHT BLUE) and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan (AMBER). </p><p>My Department monitors the deployment of commercial operators' services across the country and will continue to do so under the NBP. The NBP procurement process allows for changes to the NBP Map in the event that new commercial plans for high speed broadband are announced, or where planned commercial investment has not materialised. This process was set out in 2015 on my Department&rsquo;s website before the procurement process commenced and is available at this link </p><p><b><i>%</i></b>20-%20Consultation%20Paper%20FINAL%2021-12-15.pdf). </p><p>In 2017, as a direct result of this monitoring, my Department added a further 84,500 premises to the NBP State Intervention Area where commercial investment plans previously provided to the Department failed to materialise.</p><p>I am conscious that there are premises within BLUE areas that cannot access a high speed broadband connection. Where a citizen living in a Blue area is unable to obtain a high speed broadband service, I would encourage them to email my Department at broadband@dccae.gov.ie with their Eircode and details of the service providers they have contacted and the issues encountered in respect of accessing high speed broadband.</p><p>Where commercial operators' plans for providing high speed broadband in BLUE areas do not materialise, premises may be included as part of the State led intervention in order to achieve the Government's commitment to deliver access to high speed broadband to every premises in Ireland.</p><p>Separately, and as part of my Department&rsquo;s Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, both my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local mobile phone blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional mobile phone coverage on an economic basis.</p></reply>

The first is located in Tusla and the second in the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s Early Years Inspectorate seeks to provide a high standard of service through the medium of Irish and is committed to supporting early learning and care services where Irish is spoken. At present, Tusla has one inspector with high level proficiency in the Irish language. This inspector carried out 17 inspections through the medium of Irish in 2018. </p>  <p>  There are a number of inspectors with conversational Irish who engage with the providers outside and inside the Gaeltacht at an informal level through Irish. The Tusla Inspectorate is currently engaged in recruiting a further specific Irish language inspector with expert proficiency in both oral and written Irish.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Early Years Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills, of the current total inspection team of 20 (Whole-time Equivalent) inspectors, seven have strong capacity to engage in Early Years Education Inspection fully through Irish, including the writing of inspection reports, providing feedback for continuous improvement and responding in Irish to issues raised by personnel in the early years services.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Inspectorate deploys primary inspectors, who have special expertise in early years education, in the quality assurance of reports that are prepared for publication in Irish. </p>  <p>  The DES Inspectorate also has an active continuing professional development (CPD) programme to build the capacity of the wider Early Years Inspection team which includes Early Years and Primary Inspectors.</p>  <p>  Tuigim an r&oacute;l at&aacute; ag seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; luathfhoghlama agus c&uacute;raim chun an Ghaeilge mar theanga bheo a chur chun cinn, agus tuigim an chaoi a gcuid&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin le leana&iacute; chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.</p>  <p>  D'oibrigh mo Roinn le comhghleaca&iacute; sa Roinn Cult&uacute;ir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta chun sraith chuimsitheach gn&iacute;omhartha maidir le luathfhoghlaim agus c&uacute;ram a aont&uacute;.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-13a.418.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021300084#WRK03300"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for his question and for his interest in the qualification standards for work in the Early Learning and Care sector introduced by my department. </p><p>I understand the Deputy's reference to FETAC 5 to mean qualifications in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ). Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), which took over the functions of FETAC (the Further Education and Training Awards Council), is the awarding body for further education awards in Ireland and is also responsible for the NFQ.  Access to programmes of learning which lead to QQI-accredited awards are widely available through a variety of education and training providers nationwide. </p><p>The 2016 Childcare Regulations (Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016) came into effect at the end of June 2016. A specific section of the regulations deals with the matter of qualifications for Early Learning and Care workers who are working with children in a pre-school service.  This section of the regulations took effect for new services from 30<sup>th</sup>June 2016 and for all other services it took effect after 31<sup>st</sup>December 2016. It states (Part 3, 9.4) that each employee working directly with children attending the service must hold at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the NFQ or a qualification deemed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to be equivalent.</p><p>This regulatory change was introduced following many years of consultation with the sector. Mindful of the challenge that it would present to the sector, my department introduced the following supportive measures:</p><p>-  Learner Funds to provide sector workers with an opportunity to upskill to a Level 5 qualification. Three Learner Funds were available to upskill to Level 5, the most recent with a closing date for applications of July 29<sup>th</sup>2016. The courses undertaken through the Learner Funds were wholly funded by my Department via the City / County Childcare Committees (CCCs).</p><p>-  A &lsquo;grandfathering declaration&rsquo;, to allow sector workers nearing the end of their career to continue working. The option to apply for a grandfathering declaration was first made available in the latter half of 2014, and publicised through the CCCs. Early Years sector workers were able to avail of the grandfathering declaration up to the time that the regulations came into effect. Grandfathering declarations signed after the 30<sup>th</sup>of June 2016 are not considered valid, and this time limit is stated in the Regulations. The grandfathering declarations apply up to the start of September 2021, allowing signatories to meet the minimum regulatory standard until that time.</p><p>-  Delayed introduction of regulations. Following consultation with various stakeholders regarding regulatory change, the introduction of regulations was extended from September 2015 to June 2016. The date for the minimum qualification standard to take effect was extended beyond this to the 31<sup>st</sup>of December 2016. The sector was first informed about the intention to introduce new regulations, including a minimum qualification standard, in 2013. </p><p>-  A qualifications assessment procedure put in place by my Department in the latter half of 2015, which allows for applications to be made for individual assessment; applicants may include any documentation they believe to be relevant and assessment is made on the basis of the entire qualifications profile as evidenced by the applicant. This is conducted by officials in my Department in consultation with the Early Years Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, and is available to anyone who applies. Each application is dealt with on a case by case basis. </p><p>If the Deputy is referring to a specific case, I would advise that individual to apply to my Department for qualifications recognition, if they have not already done so.  If they want to pursue additional education, they should contact an appropriate education provider and enquire directly with them as to their options. Some education providers may be able to provide advanced access to a programme of learning on foot of pre-existing qualifications or a Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) process. </p><p>I must emphasise that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is neither an education and training provider, nor an awarding body, and cannot issue instruction to educational institutions in this regard. </p></reply>

Tusla has experienced a 40% growth in child welfare and protection referrals since its establishment in 2014. This increase in referrals clearly shows the growing awareness and concern in society with respect to children&rsquo;s wellbeing and safety.</p>  <p>  Where Tusla assess that a child is at risk, due to their home situation or, indeed, their own risk taking behaviour, they work with the parents/carers to see if the child can remain living safely  at home with social work and family support interventions.</p>  <p>  In January 2019, I attended the joint launch of the Tusla/HSE &lsquo;Hidden Harm Strategic Statement&rsquo; to alert people to the effects of substance misuse behind closed doors.  &lsquo;Hidden Harm&rsquo; is the term now being used to describe the damage caused to children where their parents or carers abuse alcohol or drugs. </p>  <p>  My Department and Tusla have been working hard to ensure early preventative services are in place to help families with these difficulties. Tusla is implementing its Partnership Prevention Family Support Programme (PPFS) to identify, with other professionals and families, ways of helping families and children before problems become habitual. </p>  <p>  Tusla has a Child Protection Notification System (CPNS), a list of children living at home, who are deemed to be at current risk, and who are subjected to child protection case conferences and structured interventions. The reasons stated for a significant number of these children&rsquo;s listing is due to an adult mental health problem, addiction or domestic violence.</p>  <p>  When a child&rsquo;s situation is at such a level of risk that they cannot be protected safely at home, they are either received into care on a voluntary basis or Tusla apply to the courts for a care order. Tusla act immediately on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. At that point, Tusla will carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for his ongoing interest in this important area. </p></reply>

It is concerned with the general adequacy of resources overall to meet existing and future issues facing children.   </p>  <p>  I am very appreciative of the support which I have received from Government over recent years in increasing the Vote of my Department. Budget 2019 represented another very significant and visible commitment to children and families. In the case of my Department, the gross amount of funding being made available in 2019 is &euro;1.510 billion, an increase of 8% over 2018 and 33% over 2016.</p>  <p>  In terms of manpower, since my appointment as Minister there has been a 54% increase in staffing in my Department from 181 employees to a current staffing level of 279 people. The increase in staffing numbers reflects the continuing growth in the responsibilities of my Department and has included the recruitment of a number of specialists with expertise, drawn from professional streams across a number of disciplines. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is difficult to speculate as to the adequacy of the existing resources in terms of issues likely to affect children in future years. I am confident that the significant additional resources secured over recent years is enabling my Department, and its agencies, to address key issues and challenges currently affecting children's lives. My Department, through ongoing policy and research, is continuously planning for future challenges and is keenly aware of the importance of this work.</p></reply>

A Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group (CFIDIG) with membership from all Government Departments, the Health Service Executive, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Child and Family Agency - Tusla, provides a forum for members to raise child welfare and protection issues of general concern or with a cross-departmental or cross-sectoral dimension.</p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015, which I fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including in particular:   </p>  <p>  -  An obligation on defined categories of persons (mandated persons) to report child abuse, at or above a defined threshold, to Tusla; </p>  <p>  -  A requirement on providers of relevant services to children to carry out a risk assessment and  develop a Child Safeguarding Statement outlining the policies and procedures in place to manage any risks identified</p>  <p>  The Act also places the CFIDIG on a statutory footing and requires each Minister of the Government to prepare and publish a Sectoral Implementation Plan, setting out the programme of measures that are either in place or planned to ensure compliance with Children First. My Department&rsquo;s Sectoral Implementation Plan and Child Safeguarding Statement are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The legislation operates alongside the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children. The guidance sets out definitions of abuse, and signs for its recognition. It explains how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla. It sets out what organisations need to do to keep children safe. It also describes the obligations under the Children First Act 2015 and who they attach to. These guidelines have been in place since 1999 and were fully revised and published in October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act. </p>  <p>  The Children First Act is part of suite of child protection legislation that also includes the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016; and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.</p></reply>

I propose to reply in respect of children at risk who come to the attention of Tusla child protection services. </p>  <p>  The most recent data available from Tusla covers the period up to and including November 2018. Referrals data is published on a provisional basis each month and validated figures are published quarterly. The monthly data from Tusla indicates that there were a total of 52,779 referrals to Child Protection and Welfare Services up to end of November 2018. This is almost 5,700 ahead of the comparable figures from 2017. This is an average of approximately 4,800 referrals per month.</p>  <p>  There has been an increase in referrals in recent years. An increase of 9% in 2016, an increase of 13% in 2017 and it is expected that there will be a similar increase when the final figures for 2018 are compiled.  This increase in referrals clearly shows the growing awareness and concern in society with respect to children&rsquo;s wellbeing and safety.</p>  <p>  All referrals to Tusla are screened in a timely manner.  Where appropriate, the referral will be routed to family support services or, in the case of child protection and welfare concerns, to a social work service. It is important to stress that urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team. </p></reply>

A separate meeting is held on the day of these bi-annual meetings with national organisations in receipt of targeted youth funding to keep them updated on the ongoing work on the Value for Money and Policy Review reforms. </p>  <p>  Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards (ETB) provide an important support role to my Department in the co-ordination and administration of youth services at local level across the country. In order to keep my Department informed of their ongoing work, officials hold quarterly meetings attended by all Youth Officers from across the country. These meetings assist my Department in identifying service needs and emerging issues, particularly for vulnerable young people.  The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department has set up a working group with five Youth Officers focussed on strategic planning for future capital funding for the youth sector.</p>  <p>  My Department holds scheduled meetings with Youth Work Ireland twice a year in relation to the important work of this organisation. There is also ongoing active engagement between my Department and the youth constituency of the of the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures Advisory Council. Some national youth organisation representatives are members of this Council.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Youth Affairs Unit are engaged with programmes run by the National Youth Council of Ireland, such as the Youth Arts Strategic Review and Plan Advisory Steering Group and the National Health Programme Strategic Planning Working Group, both of which receive funding from my Department.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department also meet with youth organisations on an individual basis when the need arises.</p>  <p>  In 2019, &euro;60.4m has been allocated in current funding to support the provision of youth services, an increase of &euro;1.5m on 2018. The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.  Funding to staff led youth services has generally been targeted at areas of disadvantage and not in proportion to the youth population of a given area.  Funding allocations for 2019 are currently being finalised by the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department.  Letters of allocation will issue shortly.</p>  <p>  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed in 2017, which mapped youth service provision across the State. This mapping will assist the Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with ETBs to identify need and explore ways to address this need where it emerges.</p></reply>

The Commission is tasked with providing a full account of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions. Following a request from the Commission, Government granted an extension to the time frame for the delivery of its final Report. The Commission is due to report in February 2020.</p>  <p>  The scope of the Commission&rsquo;s remit includes several specific areas of practice and procedure in the care, welfare, entry arrangements and exit pathways for the women and children who were residents of 14 named institutions and the representative sample of County Homes identified by the Commission.</p>  <p>  The Government is satisfied that this independent Commission has sufficient scope to examine the broad range of public concerns, and to make a determination on their relevance to the central issues in question, and where appropriate to make any recommendations to Government which the Commission deems necessary.</p>  <p>  The Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 provides an effective mechanism to investigate complex and sensitive matters of significant public concern. The Act gives the Commission robust powers to compel persons to produce information and answer questions. It is important to recognise that a statutory Commission is fully independent in the conduct of its investigations. The precise approach to examination of evidence are matters for the Commission to decide and progress. </p>  <p>  The approach being taken provides a clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in Mother and Baby Homes. Accordingly, the Terms of Reference focus on these institutions.</p>  <p>  While the Magdalene Laundries did not function as Mother and Baby Homes, their role as entry and exit pathways will be examined and these institutions are also included in the Social History module of the Commission's work. A restorative justice ex-gratia scheme was established for former residents of these Laundries, however this scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  In its Second Interim Report the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes made a recommendation that the decision to exclude unaccompanied children who were resident in Mother and Baby Homes, including the Bethany Home, from the Residential Institutions Redress Act should be re-examined by Government. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills is responsible for the Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002 legislation and related arrangements. I understand that the redress scheme established under the act has not been extended to any additional institution since 2005 and related issues have been considered by previous Government's on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  In its examination of these matters in 2017, the Government decided it was not possible to consider any such arrangements in advance of the findings and conclusions of the Commission on relevant matters. When the Commission delivers its final report, its conclusions on all matters regarding the treatment of former residents of Mother and Baby Homes will be taken into careful consideration when determining the State's response.</p></reply>

This payment is not subject to a means-test, and is paid whether or not the recipient is in employment or not.  Those with dependent children receive a further full rate &euro;31.80 in respect of each qualified child.  When someone reaches State pension age, the personal rate increases to &euro;243.30, in line with the rate of the State pension (contributory).  It might be remembered that someone cannot receive a double payment of both the State pension and the Widows pension, and so in most cases this ensures a Widow receives the maximum pension rate upon reaching state pension age.</p>  <p>  At that point (i.e. reaching state pension age), they will not generally be in a position to supplement their pension with wages, as they will in most cases have retired.  The same rationale would not apply to widowed people of working age, who in many cases receive both income from employment and their Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension.  It is also the case that our social protection system, like most developed countries, generally provides higher rates of payment for those above pension age than for those of working age.  For example, people moving from Jobseekers Allowance to State Pension (non-contributory) can expect a significant increase in their weekly rate of payment, upon reaching state pension age.</p>  <p>  Any proposal to increase the rate of payment for widows/widowers/surviving civil partners under 66 to that of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory) would result in a significant additional cost that would have to be met from either increased PRSI or Exchequer subvention or a reduction in the general rate of payments, and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Department can support people who are homeless with no fixed abode by providing income support under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.</p>  <p>  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is considered the "safety net" within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p>  <p>  Under SWA, my Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. The Government has provided &euro;38.8 million for the exceptional and urgent needs schemes in 2019.  Under the ENP scheme payments may be made to support temporary accommodation where an exceptional need arises and there is no alternative service available. There is no automatic entitlement to these payments which are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case, in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  The Department also provides supports to tenants towards rent deposits and rent in advance under the ENP scheme with some 2,700 payments made in 2018 at a cost of almost &euro;1.9 million. This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes and who are at risk of, or who are homeless, or who rely on the private rented market to meet their housing needs.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has concerns in respect of the situation of a specific family, he should bring the details of the case to the attention of the Department.  The family should also be requested to engage with the relevant local authority to access homeless services. </p></reply>

Any person regarded as homeless may be placed into temporary emergency accommodation without the requirement to undergo a social housing assessment and be approved for social housing support; these arrangements give local authorities the flexibility that is essential to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of cases that may arise.</p>  <p>  The assessment of households for social housing support is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended, which set down a standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing support.</p>  <p>  A household may apply for support to one housing authority only (the &ldquo;housing authority of application&rdquo;), which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or that the authority agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  In determining whether a household has a local connection with its area, a housing authority must have regard to whether a household member: </p>  <p>  - lived in the area for a continuous 5 year period at any time in the past, </p>  <p>  - is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area, </p>  <p>  - is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area, or </p>  <p>  - has a relative (defined in the Regulations) living in the area for 2 years or longer.</p>  <p>  In 2013 my Department issued a clarification to all local authorities on the issue of the normal residence and local connection criteria, which advised that households were only required to meet either criterion, not both.  Thus, where a household resides in a local authority&rsquo;s area, there is no requirement to have a local connection in order to apply to that authority for support.</p>  <p>  The clarification provided that &ldquo;normally resides&rdquo; was generally intended to refer to the local authority where the household is currently resident and the household was required to provide proof of this, such as a utility bill, proof of a social welfare payment, a lease etc.  In relation to a household living in emergency accommodation, the only proof of residence may be a social welfare payment received in the area and it was not the intention that such households would also have to demonstrate a local connection.</p>  <p>  As the 2011 Regulations do not provide for a local authority to impose a minimum period of residence in the area prior to application for social housing support, authorities were advised that it was not intended that households were required to have resided in the functional area of the housing authority of application for a minimum length of time in order to be considered eligible for assessment. </p></reply>

Sites, known as special areas of conservation, are selected for the conservation of particular habitats and species listed in the Directive.  </p>  <p>  In order to avoid both accidental and deliberate damage to special area of conservation sites, it is necessary to have a system by which potentially damaging activities require consent before they can be carried out.
