    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-11a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041100050#WRA00700"><p>Ireland joined Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in December 2017 following Government and D&aacute;il approval. The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under CSDP. Under PESCO, Member States will come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations. </p>  <p>  Within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence and that any decisions, including any deepening of EU cooperation, require unanimity. Ireland continues to have a strong and equal voice on defence issues within the EU institutions.</p>  <p>  As part of PESCO, participating Member States have agreed to fulfil commitments which include; regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms, increased cooperation on cyber defence, and participating in at least one project under PESCO, among others. Member States also agree to produce a rolling National Implementation Plan  to assist in the assessment of  Member States' fulfilment of the PESCO commitments both collectively and on an individual basis. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that progress under PESCO has been positive although progress on projects has been somewhat slower than expected.  The commitments made under PESCO, and which are assessed in the National Implementation Plan, support the overall development of Defence Forces capabilities in support of peacekeeping and crisis management operations through cooperation and participation in joint projects, with like-minded partners.  The projects in which we are involved, Maritime Surveillance and EU Training Mission Competence centre are directly relevant to current and recent crisis management operations under UN mandates (Operation Sophia and EUTM Mali).   </p>  <p>  As D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has already voted on Ireland's participation in PESCO which included fulfilling the commitments as outlined in the National Implementation Plan, a further vote in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is not required.  Ireland&rsquo;s 2019 National Implementation Plan was finalised in January. It is anticipated that work on the next iteration of Ireland's National Implementation Plan will begin in Q3 later this year. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-11a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041100050#WRA01000"><p>In 2018, the overarching turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force was just below 8.1%.  The average turnover rate since 2002 is 6.3% with a peak of 8.58% in 2012.  This level of turnover, or higher, is often seen in other military organisations.</p>  <p>  This overarching turnover rate can be further broken down. At its most basic level, this can be categorised as trained or untrained personnel. Untrained personnel are those that do not complete their initial training for example General Service recruits or 2 Star Privates or Cadets. On average 22% of General Service Recruits do not complete their training. </p>  <p>  The number of trained personnel departing can vary year-on-year with significant differences not being unusual. The long run departure average for trained personnel is approximately 500 per annum. Departures of trained personnel in 2011 and 2012 exceeded 600 each year reaching a high of 677 in 2012. Departures in 2013 and 2014 were below 400 each year, reaching a low of 356 in 2014. In 2018. some 592 trained personnel departed. </p>  <p>  The overarching turnover level does not illustrate important underlying trends. As the rate of turnover within a military organisation can differ across functional areas, the impact of turnover can vary accordingly. As I have previously outlined, particular challenges exist in certain specialist areas, for example pilots. I understand that this has proved challenging for many military forces internationally and it is not unique to Ireland. </p>  <p>  There are a range of factors that influence a person's decision to remain in the Defence Forces.   These include career progression opportunities, pay, personal development opportunities, work&ndash;life balance, job stimulation and work environment.</p>  <p>  There are significant opportunities for career progression and development within the Defence Forces and there were over 800 promotions in the PDF in 2018. The Defence Forces actively encourage and support personnel to undertake education and training as well as participate in physical development and sport.  Members of the Defence Forces have opportunities for diverse service, including opportunities to serve overseas. I am also aware that the military authorities have introduced further initiatives to enhance work-life balance and I very much welcome this.</p>  <p>   Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The increases due under the agreement from 1 January 2018, 1 October 2018 and 1 January 2019, have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2019 and 2020.</p>  <p>  The Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a comprehensive examination of recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Sector. The Commission's work is on-going.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and any recommendations that arise from the work of the Commission.  </p>  <p>  The current challenges being faced by the Defence Forces are not unique and are also being experienced by other military organisations internationally.  I will continue to work closely with the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff in furthering management responses to address current challenges. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-11a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041100050#WRA01300"><p>As part of a whole of Government approach, my Department continues to engage in forward planning with the other Departments involved in addressing all issues relevant to the UK's decision to leave the European Union.  This engagement involves the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements. Furthermore, the avoidance of a hard border on the island is fundamental to the Withdrawal Agreement reached last November between the EU and the UK Government, and there can be no change to the commitments made in that Agreement. While the UK Government has so far been unable to secure parliamentary approval for the Agreement, the EU has been very clear that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, will not be reopened. The Government is not preparing for a hard border and Ireland and the EU are at one on this. As such, there are no plans for a new Army barracks in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

In this regard, a direct entrant competition for the position of military psychiatrist, which closed on 30th September 2018, yielded no applications. To continue to provide an interim in-house service until such time as the military psychiatrist position could be filled, attempts were made to secure a locum psychiatrist but these also proved unsuccessful.</p>  <p>  To explore every option to facilitate an in-house appointment, I gave approval in late-2018 for my Department to conduct a competition for a contracted civilian consultant psychiatrist at pay rates equivalent to those available in the HSE. This approval was subject to sanction by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Sanction has recently been received, and my Department is currently in the process of making the necessary arrangements for a competition to be advertised.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined on numerous occasions in the past, there is a nationwide shortage of trained psychiatrists, with recruitment issues in a number of sectors of the health service. The difficulty with recruitment for such a position is not unique to the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I also wish to stress yet again that there is no delay in referring Defence Forces personnel requiring immediate psychiatric care or assessment. Patients presenting to Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs) with a requirement for urgent psychiatric assessment are referred to HSE Accident &amp;amp; Emergency Departments. Those requiring hospitalisation are admitted immediately. Furthermore, in order to provide Defence Forces Primary Carers with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where deemed appropriate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-11a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041100050#WRA02400"><p>The siege of Jadotville was a prominent event that occurred during Ireland's peacekeeping mission in the Congo in September 1961. "A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces Regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  </p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006. </p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. </p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognise the brave actions of these men.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.</p></reply>

The Commission reported in September 2018 and implementation is now being overseen by an Implementation Group on Policing Reform. </p>  <p>  In terms of defence, the White Paper on Defence, which was approved by the Government in 2015, comprehensively deals with all aspects of defence policy and was informed by a lengthy and wide-ranging consultation process facilitated by my Department. This commenced in July 2013 when a Green Paper on Defence was published as part of a process that ultimately led to publication of the White Paper in August 2015. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Green Paper was to stimulate an open debate about future defence requirements and submissions were sought. In total, 122 written submissions were received from a wide variety of interested parties. Civil and military personnel of the Defence Organisation subsequently held follow-on meetings with selected groups and individuals and also met with other government departments and agencies, and international organisations as part of the consultation process. The then Minister for Defence also established an External Advisory Group to support him in his deliberations on the White Paper.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a symposium on the White Paper was held at Farmleigh House in May 2015 which provided a wide stakeholder group with the opportunity to hear alternative views, to learn from the experience of others and to debate the merits of differing courses of action.  The audience comprised cross-party political representation, Irish and international think tanks and academic institutions, international organisations including the EU, UN and NATO, along with top level civil and military staff of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, representatives from other government departments and agencies, Civil Defence, the Representative and official Veterans Associations of the Defence Forces, and other interested parties.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans to establish a commission on defence but, significantly, the policy framework that is set out in the White Paper is designed to be flexible and responsive.  It is within this context that the Government made a commitment to establish a process of fixed cycle of reviews to give assurance that defence policy remains up to date and relevant to changing circumstances.  The White Paper specifically provides that these defence reviews are to have a three yearly cycle and that the first of these would be a White Paper Update, which is well underway in my Department and close to completion, while a more comprehensive Strategic Defence Review will commence in early 2021.</p>  <p>  As part of the process of establishing these reviews as a permanent feature of our approach to defence policy, and to seek to do so on a consensual basis, I wrote to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, in August 2018 to obtain their views and I met with the Committee last month in this regard.</p></reply>

At present there are some 670 members of the Defence Forces serving in overseas missions worldwide.</p>  <p>  Permanent Defence Force personnel rotate to UNIFIL in May and November each year, following a six month tour of duty, on average.  The 114th Infantry Battalion is due to replace the 113th Infantry Battalion in the area of operations shortly.</p>  <p>  In respect of this upcoming deployment, I am advised by the Defence Forces that all officer command positions have been filled with the exception of one junior officer appointment which recently became vacant due to unforeseen circumstances.   The military authorities are confident that this position will be filled shortly. </p>  <p>  It should be remembered that the required increase in Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to UNIFIL was unexpected as we had been in discussions with the Czech Republic to backfill the exiting Finnish contingent.  Unfortunately this did not materialise.  At short notice, the Defence Forces were tasked to undertake a temporary backfill of our UNIFIL contingent.  As a result, we now have a Battalion in UNIFIL and also a Company in UNDOF, along with other significant postings in the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans.  This is a major success on the part of the Defence Forces to man two significant missions.  The recently agreed deployment of a Polish Armed Forces contingent together with a contribution from the Hungarian Forces, will alleviate pressure on the Defence Forces when they join our UNIFIL contingent in November 2019.    </p></reply>

Operation Sophia is primarily a security operation, designed to disrupt the traffickers business model and counter oil and weapons smuggling, rather than a humanitarian operation.  The Operation has so far contributed to the apprehension of 151 suspected smugglers and traffickers and removed approximately 550 boats from criminal organisations availability.  Because of its presence in the area, it has also contributed to over 300 Safety of Life at Sea events and rescued almost 45,000 migrants.  </p>  <p>  Where migrants have been rescued by Operation Sophia, they have been transferred to Italian ports of embarkation under agreements with the Italian authorities in relation to Operation Triton and provided for in the Operation Sophia mission operations documentation.  No migrants rescued by Operation Sophia were returned to Libya.  </p>  <p>  I have stated on a number of occasions in this House that the reports of ill treatment of migrants and refugees in Libya is a cause of concern to me and to my colleague, An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Simon Coveney, T.D..  The conditions in Libyan detention centres has informed the approach taken by Ireland and the EU in response to the migrant crisis across a number of EU and UN initiatives, including Operation Sophia.  On joining this operation, Ireland imposed a caveat with the Operation Commander that Ireland would only disembark rescued migrants into Italy.</p>  <p>  On Operation Sophia, a decision was adopted by the European Council on 29th March to extend the mandate of Operation Sophia for 6 months with a temporary suspension of its naval assets while Member States continue working on a solution related to disembarkation.</p>  <p>  The Operation mandate will continue to be implemented through strengthening surveillance by air assets as well as reinforcing training support to the Libyan Coastguard and Navy. </p>  <p>  Ireland will therefore not be committing Naval assets to the mission at this time, while 5 Defence Forces personnel continue to participate on the mission at across both the Operational and Force Headquarter.   </p>  <p>   It should be noted that although the deployment of Naval assets to Operation Sophia has been suspended, Member States have highlighted the importance of continuing to work closely with the Libyan authorities and international organisations to improve the protection of refugees and migrants in Libya.</p></reply>

As the rate of turnover within a military organisation can differ across functional areas, the impact of turnover can vary accordingly.  As I have previously outlined, particular challenges exist in certain specialist areas, for example pilots. I understand that this has proved challenging for many military forces internationally and it is not unique to Ireland. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked with examining recruitment and retention issues in the Defence sector.  Detailed statistics have been provided to assist them in this regard.  I look forward to reviewing their findings in due course.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

This engagement involves the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements. Furthermore, the avoidance of a hard border on the island is fundamental to the Withdrawal Agreement reached last November between the EU and the UK Government, and there can be no change to the commitments made in that Agreement. While the UK Government has so far been unable to secure parliamentary approval for the Agreement, the EU has been very clear that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, will not be reopened. The Government is not preparing for a hard border and Ireland and the EU are at one on this. As such, there are no plans for further troop deployments to border counties.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

Under PESCO, Member States will come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations. </p>  <p>  Within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence and that any decisions, including any deepening of EU cooperation, require unanimity.

This involves the dedicated charter of a civilian aircraft for each movement of troops, which is arranged by the Department by way of a tender competition in line with public procurement regulations. When smaller numbers of personnel are travelling to and from missions, transport is generally by way of scheduled commercial flights. </p>  <p>  The UNDOF contingent is operating in a very challenging region where there can never be complete certainty on transit routes and where the administrative procedures relating to the transit of military personnel are complex and cut across a number of jurisdictions.  Approvals for the transit of foreign military forces, in a congested conflict zone, involve many governmental layers, and are, therefore, not without hazard.  While every effort is made to secure the necessary clearances on time, we do not have control over these and rely on the good offices of the States through which we are transiting.  We will continue to engage with these States.  However, given all the variables, it is not possible to guarantee rotation dates at this time with the requisite certainty, and personnel will be advised of this uncertainty when deploying in future. </p></reply>

All equipment is subject to rigorous and regular testing and monitoring to identify where such maintenance requirements, both essential and routine are needed. </p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers which is currently underway at a cost of of &euro;55m plus VAT will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures at a combined cost of &euro;10m plus VAT will provide essential force protection overseas.</p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2018, 20 minibuses, 22 saloons, 61 logistics vehicles and 2 recovery vehicles were purchased for the Defence Forces, and funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas. A tender competition for the replacement of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of &frac34; tonne 4x4 vehicles is currently underway, and planning is also underway for the replacement of the fleet of troop carrying vehicles in the coming years. </p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft at a cost of &euro;30m plus VAT which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020. Planning is also in progress to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and a tender competition is currently underway in this regard. </p>  <p>  The on-going Naval Service ship replacement programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to investment in the Naval Service. Three new Offshore Patrol Vessels were delivered between 2014 and 2017 with a fourth, to be named the L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, delivered in late 2018, and due to be commissioned later this month. In addition, a Programme to extend the life of the P50 class vessels operated by the Naval Service, L&Eacute; Rois&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh, has recently commenced. Planning is also underway for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel. </p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.</p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022.

The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs. A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021. In addition the White Paper on Defence sets out a developmental path for the Reserve. </p><p>Within the budget of &euro;2.15m allocated to the Reserve, seven days annual paid training is provided for in respect of each effective member of the Reserve.  The budget also provides for fourteen days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the Reserve in 2018 along with career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities. This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training. </p><p>I am satisfied that members of the Amy Reserve and Naval Service Reserve are afforded the opportunity to avail of training and update their skills on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

These matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept. As such a Declined Cases agreement proposal is likely to have little effect, as insurers would simply price at what they consider the appropriate level for a particular risk.  Consequently, if there was an area where there was a significant level of claims, the price charged would likely reflect this and in many cases might be prohibitive cost wise for such businesses.  Another difficulty with such a proposal is that insurers generally operate in niche areas of the business market based on their risk appetite and their understanding of these areas.  Therefore, forcing insurers to take on risks outside of their expertise may result in them leaving the market and it may also discourage new entrants to the Irish market.  On this basis, I believe such a proposal could be counterproductive over the longer term and not in the best interest of the customer. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government is acutely aware of the difficulties that the cost and availability of liability insurance is having on businesses across the country and every effort is being made to implement the recommendations of the second Personal Injuries Commission Report in order to address the awards level differential between this country and England and Wales.  It is hoped that once this is done, there should be a significant positive impact on pricing.</p></reply>

The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. </p>  <p>  Property rental income and gains arising are exempt from tax within the REIT and are taxed at the investor level when distributed. The legislation requires that 85% of all property income profits be distributed annually to shareholders. The REIT is subject to corporation tax on income and gains not arising from the property rental business of the REIT.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that due to the obligation to maintain taxpayer confidentiality it does not disclose information in circumstances where the number of cases is so small that it might facilitate identification of the taxpayers involved. As this is the case with Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), it is not possible for Revenue to provide the data requested.  However I would note that REITs are required to be publicly listed companies and as a result they publish a wide range of detailed information including financial reports and details of their property portfolios.</p>  <p>  I am aware of concerns expressed in relation to purchases of residential properties by large-scale investors and the potential consequences for first-time buyers.  However it is also acknowledged that insufficient supply is a primary driver of price pressures in the housing market and it is my understanding that REITs are engaged in the development of projects for long-term rental, thereby contributing to the overall supply of property.  I therefore do not currently have plans to change the REIT tax structure.  However the Deputy will be aware that I committed that my officials would undertake a review of the impact of REITs and Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) on the residential property market, with a report to be presented to the Tax Strategy Group this summer, and work is ongoing in this regard.</p></reply>

The bicycle must be for the employee/director&rsquo;s personal use in undertaking the whole or part of the journey to or from work.  Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers. </p><p>The scheme applies to a pedal cycle, tricycle and a pedelec. A pedelec means a bicycle or tricycle which is equipped with an electric motor (with a maximum continuous rated power of 0.25 kilowatts) which cuts out when a speed of 25 kilometres per hour is reached, or sooner if the cyclist stops pedalling the bicycle or tricycle.  </p><p>It is assumed that the reference to &ldquo;cargo bikes&rdquo; by the Deputy means a bicycle specifically designed to carry a load.

In Budget 2019, school leadership is again supported with an additional release day for teaching principals in primary schools and a further four additional release days for teaching principals in schools with special classes. These additional release days - 18, 24, and 30 depending on the size of the school - will be effective from 1st September 2019.  </p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets, including &euro;0.4 million made available in Budget 2018 to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This funding provided an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Enabling teaching principals to have one release day per week would cost an estimated &euro;7.5m per annum. Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process.  </p>  <p>  The Primary Education Forum was established in September 2018 and aims to support the planning and sequencing of change in the primary school sector and to exchange information on the intent and impacts of the actions in the Action Plan for Education in order to look for synergies and opportunities to streamline implementation and address workload issues.</p>  <p>  Membership represents key personnel from the Department, school management, and representatives of school leadership and representatives of teachers, with the Forum akin to a working group in scale.</p>  <p>  Through adopting this approach, my Department and partners have already agreed to make several changes to the pace and sequence of planned reforms. These include the decision to re-schedule the implementation of the Primary Mathematics Curriculum to give teachers the time to expand on their understanding and engage more fully with the new curriculum and to allow for further supports to be developed for teachers. Also, I took the decision to pace the commencement of the Education (Admission to schools) Act 2018 by initially focusing on regulations relating to the essential key features of the Act and there was agreement to consult with the sector on the regulations to be put in place alongside the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act.</p></reply>

Under tax law, a school authority is regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as the "Principal Contractor" for tax purposes when it is delivering a building project.  My Department advises a school authority of this at the time the grant for the works is being approved.  Schools are also advised that the Revenue Commissioners has published a guidance document for school management authorities in this matter which is available on both my Department&rsquo;s website and the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; website.  </p>  <p>  The Department-funded Financial Services Support Unit (FSSU), which operates in the Primary, Community, Comprehensive and Voluntary Secondary Sectors, is an important source of advice and support for schools on financial governance matters including tax compliance including RCT requirements. </p>  <p>  The main requirement for a school authority to meet its obligations when delivering a school building project is to register with the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; online system and to follow the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; guidance in relation to deducting and paying over tax, where this arises, for the contractor carrying out the works.  </p>  <p>  It is a central principle that all bodies in receipt of Exchequer funding should be fully compliant with tax regulations and it is a core responsibility of the boards of these bodies to ensure such compliance. </p>  <p>  The stipulations of the Code of Practice for Governance of State Bodies in respect of taxation apply in the Department's aegis bodies.  More generally, the provisions regarding tax clearance for bodies in receipt of grant funding are set out in the appropriate circulars issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, namely circular 13/2014 (management and accountability of grants) and circular 44/2006 (tax clearance procedures - grants, subsidies and similar type payments).  </p>  <p>  With respect to schools, the Department has issued a circular to all management authorities (circular 51/2013) on tax compliance. This circular set out the Department's expectation that all schools should be exemplary in respect of compliance with taxation obligations and drew their attention to relevant Revenue documentation.  In the ETB sector, the bodies are subject to audit by the ETB Internal Audit Unit and are externally audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. </p>  <p>  Capital payments for projects undertaken by higher education institutions are made through the Higher Education Authority (HEA).  An institution must confirm that it is tax compliant before a payment is made by the HEA.  </p>  <p>  To enhance awareness of tax issues across the education sector, the Department has arranged periodic seminars in conjunction with Revenue.  The last such seminar was held in December 2017. </p>  <p>  With respect to suppliers of goods and services, the Department validates suppliers via the Revenue eTax Clearance system on a regular basis.</p></reply>

The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is aimed at assisting in achieving this target by transferring existing schools from denominational to multi-/non-denominational patronage in line with the wishes of the school community.</p><p>The process is composed of two separate and distinct phases - the Identification Phase and the subsequent Implementation Phase. The first Identification Phase of the phase 1 pilot process is nearing completion for 16 initial areas nationwide.</p><p><b>Identification Phase</b></p><p>In the Identification Phase, each of the country&rsquo;s 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district where they consider, based on census data and local knowledge, there is likely to be an oncoming demand for more diversity of patronage within the local educational provision. In the case of Tipperary ETB, the area selected is Roscrea. Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs. ETBs, having analysed the survey results, then draw up comprehensive reports detailing the outcomes of the surveys in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron/landowner in the area, which is the Catholic Bishop or Archbishop in most cases, concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand.</p><p>The response of the Bishop to any identified oncoming demand for greater diversity of school patronage in the area is included in the report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department.  </p><p>As it currently stands, most of the Identification Phase reports from these 16 initial areas have been finalised and it is envisaged that the reports will be published on my Department's website www.education.ie in the first half of this year.</p><p><b>Implementation Phase</b></p><p>Following the publication of the first round of reports, it is intended that the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase.</p><p>It is intended that the Implementation Phase would involve the existing patron of the majority of schools in each area, i.e., the relevant Catholic Archbishop or Bishop, consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the oncoming demand for a greater diversity of patronage among the schools in their area.</p><p>Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing.</p><p>I recently had a very constructive meeting with Irish Episcopal Conference representatives in relation to a number of matters including Reconfiguration. The Bishops reiterated their commitment to the Reconfiguration process. Further engagement is planned in this regard and I look forward to working positively with the Bishops on this matter in a spirit of continued partnership.</p><p><b>Early Movers</b></p><p>Separately to the main Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process, there is also a possibility for  school communities to directly engage with their patron regarding transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron.  For example, the &lsquo;early movers&rsquo; provision fast-tracks patronage reassignment.  The first 'early mover' reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017.  Any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the 'early movers' provision should contact their school patron directly.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly. In addition, as you will appreciate, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management has the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise. For this reason, the number of Garda&iacute; available in any one Garda Station on a particular day is subject to the operational requirements of the overall Division.   </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that Strokestown Garda Station forms part of the Castlerea District. The Garda strength of the Castlerea District on 31 March 2019, the most recent date for which figures are available, was 90, including 18 Sergeants and 1 Inspector, of whom 4 Garda&iacute; and 1 Sergeant are assigned to the Strokestown Garda station.  </p>  <p>  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 recruits have attested as members and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 18 of whom have been assigned to the Roscommon/Longford Division. </p>  <p>  The Government has increased the budget by for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and he also intends to recruit 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p>  <p>  I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions including the Roscommon/Longford Division.</p></reply>

In light of these findings, I understand that there are no plans under consideration at present to make it mandatory for persons to need to register for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  With respect to the harm caused by drug related crime more generally, this is something that is of great concern to me and every effort is being made to tackle this issue. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na play a key role in ensuring that individuals who threaten the welfare and well-being of the communities they serve are brought to justice.  All Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the detection and prevention of crime, whether it be drug related crime or otherwise.  Tackling drugs and organised crime remains a core focus of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.   </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have sufficient resources to carry out their important work and, as such, funding in this area has been very significant in recent years, in particular through the accelerated programme of Garda recruitment. This will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enhance policing services in communities nationwide. Investment is this area has resulted in additional personnel being assigned to the Specialist Bureaus that come within the ambit of Special Crime Operations, including the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department and the Government is fully committed to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to tackle all forms of criminal activity, with a particular focus on the safety of our citizens.</p></reply>

The application can be made by the following:</p><p>- The complainant concerned; </p><p>- The WRC; </p><p>- A Trade Union, with consent of the employee; or </p><p>- An excepted body of which the employee/complainant is a member.</p><p>In the case of an Adjudication Officer&rsquo;s decision, the application to the District Court can be made after a period of 56 days has elapsed from the date the decision was issued to the parties. A period of 42 days must have elapsed from the date the Labour Court decision was issued to the parties before the application can be made in respect of that decision. The application must be made to a judge of the District Court in which the Respondent concerned ordinarily resides.  Failure to comply with an order of the District Court is a criminal offence under section 51 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  A person found guilty of such an offence, shall be liable on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. It is open to a complainant who has received a decision from an Adjudication Officer which has not been appealed, to make an application for enforcement of this decision in the District Court. </p><p>The WRC has discretion, having regard to resources, capacity available, cost and the circumstances of a case, to accept a request to make an application to the District Court on behalf of the complainant for an order directing the Respondent to comply with the decision.  In exercising that discretion, the WRC has regard to the matters set out in the <b>Criteria for Enforcement</b>contained in the Guidance Notes to the Application Form for making such requests.  This is available at the following link.  </p><p>. </p><p>In 2016 a total of 43 decisions were enforced following an application by the WRC to the District Court with 85 and 66 completed in 2017 and 2018 respectively. </p><p>In the case the Deputy has referred to, the Complainant, when completing the initial complaint application form, had not correctly identified the legal entity they were raising the complaint against. This is a very important requirement and the necessity to do so is emphasised in the complaint form. Complainants are instructed to check details on the Companies Registration website before completing the complaint form.  </p><p>The case was referred to the Legal Proceedings Committee of the WRC for a decision as to the appropriateness of seeking an order in the District Court. In the circumstances, obtaining an enforcement order was not possible.</p></reply>

In particular the sector needs to engage with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social protection who have responsibility for EURES the (European Employment Services), and who are well positioned to help sectors to recruit from within the EEA.  </p>  <p>  The next review process to consider changes to the lists of occupations is scheduled to commence with a new public consultation phase over the next few weeks with any changes proposed based on the evidence considered, for implementation soon after.</p></reply>

One of the CCPC&rsquo;s principal statutory functions as a competent authority is to investigate suspected breaches of EU and Irish competition law (i.e. Article 101 and Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (&ldquo;TFEU&rdquo;), and section 4 and section 5 of the Competition Act 2002, as amended, (the &ldquo;Competition Act 2002&rdquo;), respectively).  ComReg was empowered as a competent authority for competition law under the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007, specifically in relation to the electronic communications sector. </p>  <p>  At the conclusion of an investigation into a suspected breach of Irish or EU competition law, the competent authority may form the view that an infringement of either section 4 or section 5 of the Competition Act 2002 (and/or Article 101 or Article 102 TFEU) has occurred. It may then decide to initiate civil or criminal proceedings in the courts against the undertaking(s) and individuals (including company directors and managers) involved. In Irish law, the power to impose financial sanctions for breaches of competition law is reserved exclusively to the criminal courts. </p>  <p>  Section 14A of the Competition Act 2002 sets out the two possible civil sanctions available. The competent authority may seek a declaration of illegality (i.e. a court ruling that a particular arrangement or behaviour is unlawful) and/or an injunction (i.e. a court ruling requiring a particular arrangement or behaviour to be terminated). </p>  <p>  The Competition Act 2002 provides that all infringements of competition law are potentially criminal in nature and section 8 of the Competition Act 2002 sets out the possible criminal sanctions. If a summary criminal prosecution is brought for breach of competition law, the District Court may impose fines of up to &euro;5,000 on the business or individual concerned and/or a prison sentence of up to 6 months on an individual. On conviction on indictment for competition law offences, the Central Criminal Court may impose fines of up to &euro;5 million or 10% of annual turnover on a business or individual. In the case of &lsquo;hardcore&rsquo; breaches of competition law, the Central Criminal Court can impose a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years on an individual. In addition, section 839 of the Companies Act 2014 (in conjunction with the Companies Act 2014 (Section 839) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 147 of 2016)) provides that individuals convicted on indictment for a competition law offence are automatically disqualified from acting or being appointed as a director or other officer, auditor, receiver, liquidator or examiner, or being in any way concerned in the management of a company for a period of five years after the date of conviction (or for such other period as the court may order).  </p>  <p>  In addition to seeking the civil and criminal sanctions described above, negotiated compliance agreements can be sought by the competent authority pursuant to section 14B of the Competition Act 2002. This mechanism provides that a party under investigation may offer binding commitments or undertakings to the competent authority to allay its competition concerns and thereby bring the investigation to a close. The commitments are then made an order of the High Court, breach of which exposes the responsible party to contempt of court. </p>  <p>  Directive (EU) 2019/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 to empower the competition authorities of the Member States to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 14 January 2019. Known as the ECN+ Directive, it has to be transposed by 4th February 2021 and will give the competent authorities additional enforcement powers and will necessitate the introduction of non-criminal fines for breaches of EU competition law.</p></reply>

The General Scheme encompasses the regulation of a range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. The Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR. </p>  <p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year. The review is in progress and the Joint Committee intends to report thereon before the summer recess. The recommendations in the Committee&rsquo;s Report will be considered during the ongoing process of drafting this Bill in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and although  it is not possible to give a definitive timeline for the enactment of this legislation, I wish to assure the Deputy that it is a priority for me and my Department. </p>  <p>  The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents, others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers) and, most importantly, the children who will be born as a result of AHR. Consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born through AHR is a key principle underpinning the Scheme. </p></reply>

A wide-ranging set of modernisation measures has also been agreed in the areas of eHealth, medicines management and multidisciplinary working.</p>  <p>  In return for cooperation with these service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) over the next 4 years. This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease programme.</p>  <p>  The estimated full year cost of implementing the reform and modernisation measures in 2019 is &euro;27 million. An additional &euro;38 million will be provided to meet the full year cost in 2020.  In addition, &euro;15 million will be provided in 2020 for the first phase of the roll out of the chronic disease programme. </p></reply>

This has taken longer than anticipated with respect to determining the most robust monitoring mechanism to preserve the integrity of the implementation of the Codes for the benefit of public nutritional health and in line with the main objective of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP) to deal with the problem of obesity. The progression of the development of guidelines to govern the implementation of these codes is also being conducted in tandem with the development of the robust monitoring mechanism.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has engaged with industry representation on initiating a register of signatories to the Codes of Practice from the perspective of compiling a list of companies that would be signing up to the Codes. The development of guidance on the interpretation of the Codes will precede the development of this list. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with industry both formally and informally in a number of areas of interest within the context of obesity. For example, and as the Deputy is aware, the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group agreed to establish a sub-group for Reformulation. This sub-group has met on a number of occasions since being established and agreed their Terms of Reference. The Reformulation sub-group is technical in its work programme. The work of the sub-group will primarily set targets on reformulation of food and drink. It will also make recommendations on addressing reduction of portion sizes and on monitoring and validation procedures. </p>  <p>  As part of its work, a workshop between the Reformulation sub-group and Food Sector Stakeholders comprised of, among others, industry on reformulation, has taken place on two separate occasions. These provided an important opportunity for detailed engagement with key Food Sector Stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of reformulation in the interests of promoting the health and wellbeing of the population. And the work of the sub-group is now building on this engagement. </p></reply>

Results from the pilots were very positive with evidence of improvements in the quality of care such as reduction in nurse sensitive outcomes, a reduction in care left undone events, increases in staff and patient satisfaction, a reduction in length of stay and absenteeism and reduction in spend on agency costs.</p>  <p>  The unique point of the Framework is that it determines the required nurse staffing and skill mix by matching the nursing resource to the type and number of patients on an individual ward and individual patients&rsquo; needs.  It is built on a rigorous methodology involving complex calculations of a number of elements, including the required nursing hours per patient day, patient acuity and dependency, bed occupancy, indirect nursing hours required, the skill mix required to meet patient needs, patient out comes and staff and patient experience. As such accurate whole time equivalent requirements and associated costs will only be available when all medical and surgical areas are assessed as part of the implementation of the Framework.        </p>  <p>  The pilot sites did indicate that additional resources, both nursing and healthcare assistants, were required in those pilot sites. These were met through a mix of additional recruitment and agency conversion. Indicative average figures from one model 4 hospital in the pilot identified additional average recruitment as 2.5 whole time equivalent per ward. (1.1 Health Care Assistant  and 1.4 Staff Nurse).  This uplift was in addition to conversion of agency. This uplift is an average figure and the pilot demonstrated that some wards required no uplift, some required a skill mix adjustment, some required Health Care Assistants only and some did require more than the 2.5 uplift.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently working on an implementation plan to rollout the Framework to all Model 4 hospitals. An essential part of the implementation is the acquisition and introduction of the supporting ICT system.  The procurement process is at an advanced stage.</p></reply>

These suggestions appear inconsistent with the Food Pyramid guidelines in Healthy Ireland, the national framework for action to improve health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland Food Pyramid, published by the Department of Health, recommends that children aged 9-18 years of age consume five portions of dairy each day, given the importance of calcium during this life stage to support the development of healthy bones and teeth.  Red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and nuts also provide protein essential for growth and repair, and they are also the main source of iron for healthy blood.  Two servings a day from this food shelf are recommended in the Healthy Ireland Food Pyramid.  </p>  <p>  My Department runs the EU School Milk Scheme in national schools, in conjunction with the National Dairy Council. This scheme is carefully aligned with the Department of Health guidelines, and with the European Commission, which funds the School Milk Scheme with the objective of cultivating healthy eating habits at an early age.  My officials are actively engaged in the on-going cross-Government collaboration on Healthy Ireland initiatives.</p></reply>

As part of the SEA process, there will be an 8 week public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, later in 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.

In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time. Where the 90 day threshold is exceeded, change of use planning permission will be required.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, where a person owns a property that it not their principal private residence and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will also be required to apply for a change of use planning permission unless the property already has a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. It will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, having regard to guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area concerned and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that these proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible type lettings including lettings to those coming to Ireland under temporary employment contracts or those moving employment location and who require temporary accommodation while seeking long-term accommodation etc. </p>  <p>  The new arrangements are being introduced through the planning code and each planning authority&rsquo;s enforcement unit will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing these new requirements.  Additional funding will be  provided to support local authority enforcement of the new short-term letting arrangements and my Department will be engaging with the relevant local authorities in that regard.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed planning reforms will come into effect on 1 July 2019 and the  primary legislative provisions required to underpin the proposals are currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas through the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018. In addition, the necessary supporting planning regulations to further underpin the proposals are currently being finalised and details will be published in due course.</p></reply>

This requirement relates to the need for a clear management structure and shared communal facilities for this particular form of development. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the positive effects that institutional investment can have in terms of the supply of housing, not least given the scale of housing development envisaged under the National Planning Framework over the period to 2040, particularly apartment developments in the main urban centres.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to improving security of tenure of tenants and I have brought forward additional measures in this regard for Committee Stage of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018. These include providing new powers to the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the rent increase restrictions in Rental Pressure Zones, which are the areas where institutional investment tends to be concentrated.</p>  <p>  The legislation will allow the RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made. It will also require the annual registration of tenancies with the RTB and significantly extend the notice periods for tenancy terminations by landlords.  </p>  <p>  The annual registration of tenancies will provide improved data on the profile of landlords in the market, including institutional landlords, and will be of benefit to my Department in keeping the market under review, ensuring that we facilitate the positive impacts of institutional investment, while addressing any broader issues that may arise.  </p>  <p>  In relation to tenure mix, National Policy Objective 37 of the National Planning Framework requires each local authority to carry out a Housing Need Demand Assessment (HNDA) in order to correlate and accurately align overall future housing requirements, as an evolution of their existing Housing Strategy requirements under Part V of the 2000 Act. This will assist local authorities in ensuring long-term strategic housing needs are met across all types, tenures and locations across their functional areas, both urban and rural. My Department intends to provide further guidance to local authorities later this year, to support their HNDA work as part of the review of their Development Plans. </p></reply>

The provision of central funding will allow for focus to be given to the role of the Office in establishing a co-ordinated approach towards the implementation of their Vacant Homes Action Plans and will reinforce the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office is expected to play a key role in the co-ordination of this work within the local authority.</p>  <p>  The Vacant Homes Unit in my Department facilitated a seminar (in October 2018) to allow the network of Vacant Homes Officers meet with relevant Department Officials, ensuring that information on reactivating vacant homes into the liveable housing stock is made available to both the Department and to all Vacant Homes Officers.</p>  <p>  Vacant Homes Officers met with the Department only yesterday at a seminar to launch the Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings, another commitment under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland in respect of the optimum utilisation of our existing housing stock.</p></reply>
