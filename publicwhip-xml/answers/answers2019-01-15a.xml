All submissions were assessed following a three stage process and against a 10 point pre-assigned assessment criteria framework.  An initial appraisal process on all submissions was carried out within my Department, with preliminary recommendations being made to a Project Advisory Board (PAB) who provided high-level input and advice as applicable per category or proposal.  Following this process, preliminary proposals were presented to a management committee who brought the final recommendations to me for consideration. </p>  <p>  On 26 November 2018, I announced details of the 88 successful applicants for funding, details of which are published on my Department's website.  This included two types of project: Category A - projects that are 'ready to go' and Category B - projects which are at an earlier stage (Master-planning/Feasibility) and which will assist in forming a future pipeline of projects, as the URDF is a rolling fund, with &euro;2 billion available to 2027. </p>  <p>  Successful bid proposals have been approved in principle, subject to final agreement of technical details with my Department, and the funding allocations should be regarded as an initial investment of support for the projects.  My Department will be meeting with successful applicants, as necessary, over the coming weeks to discuss the detailed progression of proposals on foot of which contract agreements and associated documentation will be finalised.</p>  <p>  It became apparent during the assessment process that there was a further category of Project, described as &lsquo;Category C&rsquo;, which comprised projects that could not be funded as part of the initial call, but are likely to have strong potential as part of future calls, subject to further development and, in some cases, refinement.  My Department is providing feedback to the  proposers of these projects also.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that a second call for proposals under the Fund will be launched later in the first quarter of this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-15a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019011500058#WRA01000"><p>Since 2016, some 40 rapid delivery projects have been added to the social housing construction pipeline and these are expected to yield in the region of 1,100 homes over the period to 2021.  While data in relation to Q4 2018 outputs is currently being compiled, data up to Q3 2018 shows that 325 homes had been delivered under the programme. The allocation and tenanting of these and all social housing homes is a matter for the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  In relation to the repair and leasing scheme- to end Q3 2018, a total of 1,214 applications had been received from property owners; 48 homes had been brought back into use and were tenanted; and a further 122 agreements for lease had been signed. In addition, over 250 social housing homes have been delivered to date through the buy &amp;amp; renew scheme, including some properties that may have initially been considered under the repair and leasing scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing Agency &euro;70 million Fund, the Agency had bids accepted on 874 homes at end November 2018,  814 of which were vacant. Contracts have been signed for 571 homes and 531 of these purchases have closed. </p>  <p>  Each local authority now has a dedicated Vacant Homes Office, whose work includes establishing a co-ordinated approach towards the implementation of their Vacant Homes Action Plans. Having undertaken initial vacancy assessments within their administrative areas, and drilling down into the available vacancy statistical data, it appears that a significant proportion of potentially vacant residential properties are not in areas of high demand for housing. Notwithstanding this, my Department will continue to work closely with local authorities and other key stakeholders to ensure that all reasonable avenues for addressing vacancy are pursued.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The Housing Agency is continuing to carry out the detailed statistical work, which will underpin this review, on behalf of my Department. </p>  <p>  The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

In 2018, they again contributed significantly to the output of new build social housing and there was a clear demonstration of increasing capacity to deliver. Of particular importance are AHBs' potential to harness non-Exchequer investment in social housing, as well as their specialist expertise in tenant and estate management and in the provision of special needs housing.  </p>  <p>  Through local authorities, my Department provides AHBs with access to a range of funding streams to assist with the delivery of social housing, including construction activity.  All funding schemes seek to secure value for money for the Exchequer and the highest quality social housing homes for those on local authorities' waiting lists. This is done by ensuring that the relevant local authority is fully supportive and approves of the project, requiring independent valuations of costs for all construction, acquisition and leasing projects, adhering to unit cost ceilings which also apply to local authorities, and undertaking an independent financial appraisal of certain projects. </p>  <p>  As part of the 2018 Spending Review process, an analysis of current and capital expenditure on social housing supports, including the supports available to AHBs, was carried out by the Irish Government Evaluation and Economic Service (IGEES).  The findings of this review, together with the work of my own Department and local authorities in respect of the management of the individual funding streams, provide assurance that appropriate value for money scrutiny is in place in relation to AHB activity in the provision of social housing.</p></reply>

The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), decided by local authority members annually, is applied to the valuation determined by the Valuation Office, to calculate the amount payable. Rates income is vital to the delivery of local services and the elected members adopt the ARV they consider necessary in order to provide those services.</p>  <p>  The national average ARV has not changed significantly in recent years.  It decreased slightly each year from 2010 to 2015 and increased, only slightly, each year from 2016 to 2018.</p>  <p>  Local authorities may offer assistance or money in kind in order to promote the interests of the local community, which includes the economic and general development of the administrative area of the authority concerned.  Local authorities also work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulty in the payment of rates and facilitate flexible payment options that reflect capacity to pay.  </p>  <p>  The Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 was published in August 2018 and includes provisions to allow local authorities to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support policy objectives, including, local economic and community plans; development objectives and national planning policies.  I hope the Bill can be progressed through both Houses as early as possible this year.</p></reply>

Individuals, who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP and avail of full-time employment and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent.</p>  <p>  At the end of Q3 2018 there were more than 40,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and over 25,000 landlords and agents in receipt of monthly HAP payments. As HAP is a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p>  <p>  Guidelines on inter-authority movement were introduced in 2017 to allow local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households currently on one local authority's waiting list, who wish to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, subject to conditions.</p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service provides all local authorities with the option to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme. I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating.</p></reply>

It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.</p>  <p>   I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion or to commence a review of the scheme more generally.</p></reply>

The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is well underway and making significant progress. Annual delivery targets were exceeded in 2016 and again in 2017. By end September 2018, over 63,700 additional social housing solutions had already been provided under the plan. </p>  <p>  The latest data in relation to social housing delivery sets out the position at  end Q3 2018 and is published on my Department's website. This shows that some 18,781 additional housing solutions had been provided across all local authorities in the first nine months of 2018. This represents 74% of the overall target for 2018 and an increase of 6,423 on the position at end Q2.</p>  <p>  In terms of build activity, 2,369 social housing homes, or 48% of the target for 2018, were delivered in the first 9 months of the year. Excluding voids, 1,764 new build homes were delivered at end Q3 2018,  comprising 833 local authority build, 582 Approved Housing Body build and 349 Part V homes. </p>  <p>  Data in relation to Q4 2018 is currently being compiled and will be published shortly. I am satisfied  that the overall national social housing target of delivering approximately 25,500 social housing solutions in 2018 will be met and that, within that, a strong performance on new build delivery will have been achieved.</p>  <p>  The picture will, of course, vary from one local authority area to another, in terms of what was achieved. Last January, I committed to publishing individual targets for  housing delivery in each Local Authority area in 2018, to enable greater transparency and accountability when it comes to increasing the stock of social housing. The Government has committed over &euro;6 billion to Rebuilding Ireland and it is vital that taxpayer funding is used efficiently and transparently to deliver new homes. </p>  <p>  Targets for 2018 were published and, in conjunction with delivery information for the fourth quarter of last year, I will publish full year delivery details by local authority, measured against the targets set at the beginning of the year. Following another Housing Summit later this month, this process will be repeated for 2019. </p>  <p>  With the policy, resources and funding in place, it is up to local authorities to ensure delivery, and I will continue to work with them to ensure the accelerated delivery of much needed homes for our citizens.</p></reply>

Specifically the Plan sets out a number of actions, with substantial public funding support, to address the social housing needs of over 137,000 households over the period 2016 to 2021.  This includes delivering an additional 50,000 social housing units, with a further 87,000 households having their housing need met through the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Scheme, all supported by over &euro;6 billion of investment.</p><p>Sligo County Council is progressing the delivery of social housing under a range of programmes, in line with the targets set for them under the Plan.  Their progression in this regard can be seen through the information that is made publicly available as part of the implemention of Rebuilding Ireland.  The social housing delivery targets out to 2021 for all local authorities, including Sligo, are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: .  Each local authority's delivery against these targets is published on a quarterly basis on my Department&rsquo;s website, with data on delivery up to end Q3 2018 available at the following link: . Data on social housing delivery for end Q4 2018 is being collated and will be published shortly. </p><p>A detailed breakdown of the new social housing build programme is available at the following link, which also covers the period up to end Q3 2018: .  </p><p>I am pleased to see concrete progress being made on this programme by Sligo County Council, where 66 new social homes commenced construction at Knappagh Road, Rosses Point, Ballymote, Collooney and St Joseph's Terrace in late 2018.  Sligo Council added a further 82 social housing homes to their construction pipeline last year and I understand they are working to bring forward more projects at various locations to meet local housing need. </p><p>In general terms, Sligo County Council had a target for delivery of 239 social housing homes in 2018. To end Q3 2018, the Council had delivered a total of 328 homes across all programmes.  I am pleased to see this progress with new projects, on top of what has been already delivered, and I have assured them that the necessary funding to support their activity is available.</p></reply>

In addition, each local authority now has a dedicated Vacant Homes Office, whose work includes establishing a co-ordinated approach towards the implementation of their Vacant Homes Action Plans. I have also published the <i>National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy</i>, containing a range of objectives and key actions which will be pursued in partnership with stakeholders across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock. It draws together the strands of ongoing work in one document with a clear vision for the areas to be prioritised for continued action.  </p><p>My Department and local authorities have already been proactive in dealing with vacant properties and there are a number of schemes available to incentivise reactivating suitable dwellings into the liveable housing stock.  While the initial national rollout of the innovative Repair and Lease Scheme did not yield as much progress as hoped for, the scheme was reviewed and improvements were made to render it more effective.  Up to end Q3 2018, a total of 1,214 applications had been received under the scheme from property owners; 48 homes had been brought back into use and were tenanted; and a further 122 agreements for lease had been signed. In addition, over 250 social housing homes have been delivered to date through the buy &amp;amp; renew scheme, including some properties that may have initially been considered under the repair and leasing scheme.</p><p>In relation to compulsory purchase, the approval or confirmation of proposals for the compulsory purchase of land is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In this connection, the 2017 Annual Report of the Board - the latest report available - outlines that there was an increase in the number of compulsory acquisition cases coming before the Board.  Much of this increase was attributable to the increased use of CPO powers by local authorities to acquire individual vacant or derelict houses for social housing purposes, which is a positive development. </p><p>The use of CPO powers by local authorities to acquire land specifically for social and affordable housing is not presently a notable feature of local authorities' housing delivery programmes with the primary focus currently being on the use of existing local authority or State-owned land banks for this purpose. Instead, where local authorities have been using their CPO powers to acquire land for housing related purposes, it has been more focused on the acquisition of land to facilitate the provision of site access and other enabling infrastructure to support the development of housing schemes through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). </p><p>In relation to the vacant site levy, planning authorities are empowered under the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) to apply a vacant site levy of 3% of the market value of relevant vacant sites where a site exceeds 0.05 hectares in area, was in the planning authority&rsquo;s opinion vacant or idle in the previous year, and is in an area identified by the planning authority in its development plan or local area plan for residential or regeneration development. As signaled in Budget 2019, the rate of the levy has been increased to 7%, which will be payable for the first time in January 2020 in respect of sites listed on a local authority vacant site register for 2019.  </p><p>My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy in order to ensure the consistent application of the levy provisions by all local authorities and to facilitate the sharing of best implementation practice. My Department has also provided detailed guidance on the implementation of the levy and organised information seminars for local authorities in this regard.</p><p>While my Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their own functional areas, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, it is understood that there are collectively over 380 individual sites currently listed on the local registers.  Over 140 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy at the 3% rate in 2019, unless development works were activated in the interim, with all sites listed on the local registers in 2019 being subject to the higher 7% levy in January 2020, unless development works have been activated in the meantime.</p><p>My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.  In that context, my Department is currently examining the most recent progress reports received from local authorities in relation to the levy's implementation.</p></reply>

This Code is available for viewing on the Board's website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Section 13 of the Code outlines the procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest in the context of Board meetings, where appeals and other planning cases are determined.  Section 15.2 of the Code specifically requires that a Board member shall not deal with any case in any capacity on behalf of the Board where the member had any involvement at any time in the matter, either on a personal basis or on behalf of a previous employer or as a member of any other organisation or voluntary body. </p><p>Furthermore, section 15.4 of the Code requires that a Board member shall not knowingly deal with a file relating to a planning authority or a private practice where he or she was previously employed during the previous 2-year period or any voluntary or professional organisation of which the person is or was a member during the previous 2-year period.</p><p>In effect, the highest standards of integrity and impartiality are expected to be adhered to by Board members so that no conflict of interest issues arise in the discharge of their planning functions. Where a conflict of interest situation arises, Board members are expected to declare same and to exclude themselves from any involvement in the case in question in accordance with the Code of Conduct.</p><p>The appointment process for ordinary Board members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is set out under section 106 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, and the associated Regulations. This provides that appointments to the Board by the Minister are generally made from candidates nominated by panels of prescribed bodies which are representative of a broad range of societal interests.  </p><p>For the purposes of filling a Board vacancy arising on 31 December 2018, I initiated the relevant appointment process in August 2018 and in accordance with the provisions of the Act, nominations were sought from the relevant prescribed bodies.  A total of 11 individuals were nominated for consideration for appointment. Following detailed consideration of the nominations received, I, as Minister, made my decision and signed an Order on 5 December 2018 to appoint the individual concerned as a Board member of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, an appointment which will take effect on 1 February 2019.</p></reply>

The Agency is a commercial State body and national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing. In line with its mandate, the LDA will retain experienced staff with extensive skills and experience in project management, finance, planning, development, law and procurement and will provide professional services to master-plan key sites/areas for development in key urban areas, in partnership with local authorities and other state bodies.</p>  <p>  On establishment, the Agency had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for 3,000 new homes.  Significant preparatory work is underway in relation to these sites, with feasibility, planning and other preparatory works already initiated. Construction activity is envisaged to commence on the first homes in 2019 for delivery in 2020, pending grant of planning permissions.  </p>  <p>  The LDA is also developing a strong pipeline of additional publically owned sites. In this regard, Departments were requested, in respect of lands owned directly and by agencies under their aegis, to identify additional lands over and above the initial tranche of eight sites published when the Agency was launched.  The LDA is undertaking an in-depth analysis of the information that has been provided in response to this request, with a view to building a longer term pipeline of sites. </p>  <p>  A detailed business plan for the LDA is currently being developed and, once approved by the LDA Board, will provide additional information on its long-term delivery programme. Development of LDA managed lands will make a substantial contribution to the achievement of wider Government targets for housing delivery in general and social housing specifically, as set out in Rebuilding Ireland, enhancing supply, aiding the moderation in increases in housing costs and enabling new sources of affordable housing supply, including for cost rental accommodation.</p>  <p>  A general scheme of a Bill to establish the LDA on a primary legislative footing is expected to be published in the coming weeks, with pre-legislative scrutiny to follow shortly thereafter in parallel with the drafting of the Bill. On enactment, a permanent Chairperson and Board will be appointed.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, Deeds of Bravery Awards are given to people who have saved a human life involving personal risk to themselves. </p><p>Comhairle na M&iacute;re Gaile - the Council for the recognition of Deeds of Bravery &ndash; is under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, and it meets on an annual basis to consider and decide on the awards to be made.  The scheme has been in operation since 1947 and awards are presented in four categories &ndash; gold, silver, bronze and a certificate of recognition.  Further information relating to the Bravery Awards may be found at: .  </p><p>I wish to take this opportunity to again place on the record my appreciation of the vital contribution made to our society by the men and women of the local authority fire services. Fire services are trained to operate as teams, to evaluate each emergency situation and to undertake appropriate risk assessments to ensure the safety of the public they serve as well as their colleagues and themselves. Given the focus on teamwork and risk assessment, I have no plans to introduce a separate bravery awards scheme for individual members of local authority fire services staff.</p><p>In 1992, a scheme of long service awards for personnel in the local authority fire services was launched.  There are four categories of awards, marking service of ten years, twenty years, thirty years and forty years.  The ten-year award is a certificate presented locally, while the twenty, thirty and forty year awards all involve the presentation of medals and certificates at a national ceremony. The twenty-year award is a medal bearing the traditional logo representation of the fire service - a helmet and crossed axes.  The thirty-year award is a flame emblem.  The forty-year award is a bar; both the emblem and bar attach onto the medal ribbon.  </p><p>The first national awards presentation was organised in 1998 and is now held every two years at a national presentation ceremony. The latest of these ceremonies was held in November 2018 at which 288 fire service personnel were eligible for awards.</p></reply>

In addition, a new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was introduced on 1 February 2018, under which home loans, at affordable, fixed rates over the term of the loan can be made available to credit worthy home purchasers meeting the above income limits.</p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities in delivering affordable homes, &euro;310 million will be made available from 2019 until 2021 under the Serviced Site Fund (SSF). The (SSF) will fund facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites. At a maximum funding rate of &euro;50,000 per affordable home, at least 6,200 will be facilitated in total.</p>  <p>  On foot of a first call for proposals which issued to local authorities in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area (including Kildare), Cork and Galway City, I issued approval for ten projects costing &euro;43m, which will support 1,400 affordable homes, in December 2018.  I expect infrastructure works on these projects to begin as soon as possible and delivery of affordable homes from early 2020 onwards.  Five other projects submitted are still under active consideration and my Department is working with the local authorities concerned to progress them.</p>  <p>  A second call for proposals will issue shortly. In order to inform that process all local authorities wishing to be considered for funding have been asked to submit economic assessments of the potential to deliver affordable homes from their sites.  </p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work. It is estimated by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) that rents of between 15-25% below market are achievable. </p>  <p>  There are currently two cost rental projects at Enniskerry Road, in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Inchicore, which will deliver 50 and 330 cost rental homes, respectively.  The experience on these projects will inform a national cost rental framework under which similar projects will be rolled out on a wider scale.</p></reply>

The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is well underway and making significant progress. Annual delivery targets were exceeded in 2016 and again in 2017.  By end September 2018, over 63,700 additional social housing solutions had already been provided under the plan.  The level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 22% nationally, from 91,600 households to 71,858, between 2016 and 2018.  In Wexford, the number of households on waiting lists has reduced by 15% in one year alone, falling from 2,577 in 2017 to 2,177 in 2018.</p><p>In relation to social housing construction activity, my Department publishes comprehensive status reports on a quarterly basis of all social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas.  The most recent of these reports covers the period up to the end of quarter 3 2018 and contains information on the progress of over 17,536 new social housing homes, which are currently approved and progressing through planning, design and construction, as well as homes delivered to end quarter 3 2018. </p><p>The report shows that Wexford County Council, and the Approved Housing Bodies it is working with, have a social housing construction programme of 54 projects already complete or at planning, design, tender or construction stage, which will deliver 591 homes when complete. </p><p>Local authorities have also been undertaking targeted acquisitions with a particular focus on vacant properties in order to avoid increasing pressure and competition in local property markets. </p><p>My Department continues to engage actively with all local authorities, including Wexford County Council, to deliver social housing through all available avenues, with a particular emphasis on additional construction projects.</p><p>In relation to the rental sector, section 24A of the <i>Residential Tenancies Act 2004</i>, as amended, provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone.  Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.  For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. </p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) the annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) the average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,122 per month in Q3 2018).</p><p>The RTB Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone.  This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases.</p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at , by searching 'rent pressure zones - information'.</p><p>The data from the Rent Index Report for Q3 2018 relating to the local electoral area of Gorey, County Wexford is detailed in the table.<table><tr><th>Local Electoral Area </th><th>Quarters &amp;gt; 7% </th><th>Average 2018 Q3 </th></tr><tr><td>Gorey </td><td>5 </td><td>&euro;853.81 </td></tr></table></p><p>In Gorey, while more than 4 of the last 6 quarters have seen rent inflation of 7% or greater, the average monthly rent is below the national standardised rent of &euro;1,122 per month. Therefore, the Local Electoral Area of Gorey does not meet the criteria for designation at this time.</p><p>The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.

The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p><p>On 11 December 2018, I issued approval in principle for ten infrastructure projects across five local authority areas, in Dublin and Cork, under the first call for proposals. The first tranche of funding of &euro;43 million will enable delivery of 1,400 affordable homes on local authority lands. I expect infrastructure works on these projects to begin as soon as possible in 2019 and delivery of affordable homes from early 2020 onwards. Details of the projects are set out in the table below. There are five further projects under active consideration by my Department, with the potential to facilitate the delivery of an additional 230 affordable homes. A second call for proposals will issue shortly.</p><p>As regards the price range within which the homes will be made available to eligible households, the cost of constructing new affordable homes is dependent on a range of variables, such as the location, the scale of the development and the size and type of the homes involved. However, in preparing their bids for funding under the SSF, local authorities were advised to be guided by the Unit Cost Ceilings (UCCs) for social housing in determining the cost of the affordable homes to be delivered under this programme. </p><p>These UCCs are based on the analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period, and market tender index information. Construction cost is reflective of building costs (including VAT) and also includes normal site works and site development. All-in cost includes cost of construction, land cost, professional fees, utility connections, site investigations/surveys, archaeology where appropriate, VAT and contribution to public art. Abnormal costs are excluded from these figures.</p><p>The relevant UCC data for the Dublin local authorities is set out in the tables below.  </p><p>An important factor in the allocation of funding under the SSF is the capacity to translate that funding into a discount on the affordable homes. In addition, local authorities must consider the market price of similar homes on sale in the equivalent private market and the level of discount on market price envisaged, which will be required under the Affordable Purchase Scheme terms. The objective is to maximise the benefits from public money by funding the best value for money proposals possible. </p><p><b>Table 1: List of projects that have received approval in principle under the SSF first call for proposals</b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Project/Location</th><th>Total Provisional Cost of Proposal&euro;</th><th>Provisional Exchequer Grant Amount &euro;</th><th>Provisional Local Authority Contribution&euro;</th><th>Affordable Housing Potential </th></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>Glanmire</td><td>&euro;1,500,000</td><td>&euro;1,335,000</td><td>&euro;165,000</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>Boherboy Road</td><td>&euro;4,968,366</td><td>&euro;4,421,846</td><td>&euro;546,520</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>Kilmore Road, Churchfield</td><td>&euro;1,410,551</td><td>&euro;1,255,390</td><td>&euro;155,160</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Cherry Orchard</td><td>&euro;7,645,415</td><td>&euro;6,804,419</td><td>&euro;840,996</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Balbutcher, Ballymun</td><td>&euro;4,135,351</td><td>&euro;3,680,462</td><td>&euro;454,889</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Sillogue, Ballymun</td><td>&euro;3,975,000</td><td>&euro;3,537,750</td><td>&euro;437,250</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>Enniskerry Road</td><td>&euro;4,537,576</td><td>&euro;4,038,443</td><td>&euro;499,133</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Church Fields, Mulhuddart</td><td>&euro;11,000,000</td><td>&euro;9,790,000</td><td>&euro;1,210,000</td><td>753</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Dun Emer, Lusk</td><td>&euro;1,500,000</td><td>&euro;1,335,000</td><td>&euro;165,000</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Hackettstown, Skerries</td><td>&euro;2,198,667</td><td>&euro;1,956,814</td><td>&euro;241,853</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>&euro;42,870,926</td><td>&euro;38,155,124</td><td>&euro;4,715,801</td><td>1410</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Houses, average costs (2017 Unit Cost Ceilings)</b><table><tr><th></th><th>1 bed</th><th>1 bed</th><th>2 bed (1 storey)</th><th>2 bed (1 storey)</th><th>2 bed (2 storey)</th><th>2 bed (2 storey)</th><th>3 bed</th><th>3 bed</th><th>4 bed</th><th>4 bed </th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td></tr><tr><td>DCC</td><td>216,800</td><td>275,900</td><td>223,200</td><td>283,600</td><td>232,200</td><td>293,800</td><td>242,300</td><td>305,300</td><td>252,800</td><td>316,900</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>182,000</td><td>234,500</td><td>187,800</td><td>240,300</td><td>195,900</td><td>249,600</td><td>205,300</td><td>260,100</td><td>214,600</td><td>270,600</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>166,800</td><td>217,000</td><td>172,600</td><td>224,000</td><td>180,800</td><td>232,100</td><td>190,100</td><td>242,600</td><td>199,500</td><td>253,200</td></tr><tr><td>SDCC</td><td>182,000</td><td>234,500</td><td>187,800</td><td>240,300</td><td>195,900</td><td>249,600</td><td>205,300</td><td>260,100</td><td>214,600</td><td>270,600</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3: Apartments, average costs (2017 Unit Cost Ceilings)</b><table><tr><th></th><th>1 bed</th><th>1 bed</th><th>2 bed</th><th>2 bed</th><th>3 bed</th><th>3 bed</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td></tr><tr><td>DCC</td><td>227,700</td><td>289,600</td><td>234,400</td><td>297,800</td><td>256,100</td><td>324,000</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>191,100</td><td>246,200</td><td>197,200</td><td>252,300</td><td>216,000</td><td>275,200</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>175,100</td><td>227,800</td><td>181,200</td><td>235,200</td><td>199,300</td><td>255,900</td></tr><tr><td>SDCC</td><td>191,100</td><td>246,200</td><td>197,200</td><td>252,300</td><td>216,000</td><td>275,200</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As the Limerick regeneration programme moves forward, I expect that Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council will continue to monitor the impact of all the measures, including the Social Intervention Fund.  It will be important that evidence of these impacts is gathered and assessed to best identify ways to reinforce and sustain the benefits that are being achieved through the regeneration programme.  Until those evaluations are made, it would be premature to decide what form future supports will take. However, the Government is committed to working with the Council and the other Agencies, as well as community groups, to sustain the benefits being achieved.</p></reply>

There is widespread support for this view, as recognised in the Oireachtas approval of the <i>Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services</i>in April 2017 which supports the concept of a referendum on the issue of water services continuing in public ownership.  The Committee recommended that the wording of this amendment must be carefully scrutinised to ensure that it does not impact upon the status of Group Water Schemes and individual domestic water supplies.</p><p>The matter of the holding of a referendum is addressed in the <i>Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016</i>, a Private Member's Bill initiated by Deputy Joan Collins.The Bill is currently at D&aacute;il committee stage.  Detailed examination of the wording of this Bill as it stands which I have undertaken with the Attorney General indicates that it would give rise to unacceptable risks.  Reflecting upon the advices that I have received, I have articulated these concerns in my correspondence and engagement on the Bill with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to date.  The Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser has separately and independently advised the Committee in relation to the Bill.</p><p>In November 2018, I received Government approval for the priority drafting of proposed amendments to the Private Member's Bill to provide for a constitutional amendment which will focus on retaining the entity charged with the provision of public water services in public ownership.  My intention is that the draft wording, once finalised, will be brought back to Government for approval and can then be brought forward as a proposed amendment to the existing Bill.</p><p>Reflecting this position, and the work that needs to be completed, the referendum was not included amongst those identified by Government to be held in May 2019.  The development of the wording is currently being given priority attention by the Office of the Attorney General.  I will continue to keep the Joint Oireachtas Committee updated on progress in the matter.</p></reply>

This represents a decrease of 13,941 households or 16.2% on the last assessment in June 2017. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 71,858, a reduction of 22%. </p><p>It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time exercise and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the list. It is also important to note that social housing is a demand led service and for that reason it is difficult to predict the degree to which housing lists will decrease or increase over the next 12 months. The number of homes delivered by local authorities in a given time period does not necessarily equate to the &lsquo;net need&rsquo; for social housing support reducing by an equivalent number. The nature of the list is dynamic in that, as households are added to it, the needs of others are met and further households will leave the list for various reasons including the households themselves indicating that they no longer require State support.</p><p>Over the course of the 6-year Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan, the Government is committed to meeting the housing needs of over 137,000 households through the provision of social housing supports.

A Steering Group with representatives from each of the three stakeholders was established in 2012 for the purpose of managing the flow of information between NAMA, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). </p>  <p>  The Steering Group established a co-ordinated process, which enabled NAMA to match the residential stock of its debtors and receivers with housing requirements of local authorities. Once demand was confirmed, NAMA facilitated delivery, through its debtors or receivers, by way of either direct sale or lease to local authorities or AHBs.</p>  <p>  Local authorities, together with the Housing Agency and my Department, have worked systematically through the full list of properties identified by NAMA as potentially available, to determine if there is a social housing demand for the homes involved. This process is ongoing and demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 2,718 homes to end September 2018. To date, a total of 2,475 of these properties have been delivered for social housing.</p>  <p>  In order to expedite delivery, NAMA also established a special purpose vehicle, National Asset Residential Property Services DAC (NARPS), in July 2012, which operated by purchasing properties from NAMA&rsquo;s debtors and receivers and making them immediately available to local authorities or AHBs through a standardised long term lease. Since 2012 NARPS has delivered/contracted over 1,300 properties for lease to local authorities and approved housing bodies. These properties are included in the 2,475 figure referred to earlier.</p>  <p>  I am advised that as NAMA is now well advanced on its deleveraging programme, there is no longer any suitable stock available for purchase from debtors and receivers and accordingly there is no scope to expand the NARPS portfolio further.</p></reply>

In addition, 605 homes were delivered under the Department funded voids programme, which provides exchequer funding to support local authorities in remediating vacant houses. The voids figure does not reflect the number of vacant properties or the full extent of vacant properties repaired or refurbished as local authorities undertake significant activity in those areas from their own resources.

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market.</p>  <p>  For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended: </p>  <p>  (i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p>  <p>  (ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,122 per month in Q3 2018).</p>  <p>  The RTB Rent Index Report also includes a summary of the data used as the criteria for designating Rent Pressure Zones in relation to all Local Electoral Areas in the country.

There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones. </p>  <p>  The RTB publishes its quarterly Rent Index and advises my Department on the residential rental market on a continuous basis.  This and wider ongoing careful analysis of the rental market will inform future policy decisions in relation to the rental sector, including decisions regarding the future of RPZ designations and exemptions from the RPZ regime.  </p></reply>

The &lsquo;<i>Report on Student Accommodation: Demand and Supply'</i>identified a significant unmet demand nationally for student accommodation in the context of a forecast student population increase to nearly 193,000 by 2024. </p><p>An Inter-Departmental Working Group on Student Accommodation was established by the Department of Education and Skills in 2015 comprising stakeholders from the Higher Education Institutes, Union of Students in Ireland, NAMA and other relevant Government Departments. Policy measures to increase the supply of purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) were formulated by the group, including addressing the planning and development finance aspects in assembling new development projects.  The Government&rsquo;s <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>identified the under-supply of PBSA in Ireland and the significant related adverse impact that this deficit was having on the wider private rental sector.  The increased provision of PBSA was established as a key priority in addressing the challenges in the wider housing sector and a target of 7,000 additional PBSA bed spaces to be delivered by end 2019 was set.</p><p>Related reforms were included in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which provided for the fast-tracking of planning applications for student housing construction projects of greater than 200 bed-spaces to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and this commenced on 3 July 2017.  In addition, the legislation provides for the availability of low-cost financing from the Housing Finance Agency to the Higher Education Institutes specifically to support the delivery of new student accommodation projects.</p><p>These and other measures by my Department have assisted in delivering a significant increase in the provision of student accommodation developments nationally. Recent analysis from the Higher Education Authority has indicated that, by September 2018, over 5,500 bed-spaces had been delivered since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland. Some further 4,800 plus bed-spaces are currently under construction nationally, with over 7,900 further bed-spaces having received planning permission and are yet to commence construction. These figures indicate that the PBSA construction targets will be met, and indeed surpassed, and that important progress is being made in the provision of newly constructed accommodation for this distinct segment of housing demand.</p><p>The increase in new student accommodation, as detailed above, is contributing to the increase in the overall stock of residential accommodation nationally.  As it is targeted specifically at students, it would not be expected to have a direct impact in terms of reducing social housing waiting lists; however, its direct impact in reducing student-related housing demand pressures in the general private rental sector indirectly supports the capacity to deliver social housing supports through schemes such as the Housing Assistance Payment.  This is one of a range of factors that has contributed to the reductions in social housing waiting lists over recent years, as set out in the annual statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA).  The most recently published SSHA indicates that there were 71,858 households on all local authority waiting lists as at 11 June 2018, a reduction of 22% on the comparable figure in 2016. Full details in relation to the 2018 SSHA are available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-15a.150.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019011500061#WRD01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 98 together.</p><p>Policy measures relating to radon detection and remediation are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  While the issue of radon was considered during the preparation of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017, it was not introduced at that time and I have no plans, at present, to amend the regulations to introduce mandatory radon testing in rented accommodation.  I will, however, keep the matter under review, in consultation with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  </p><p>The purpose of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 is to provide a basic standard for decent, safe and secure accommodation. These Regulations focus on tenant safety and include new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety. With very limited exemptions, these apply to social housing as well as private rented residential accommodation.</p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the regulations.  Responsibility for enforcement rests with the relevant local authority. </p><p>While there is no obligation on local authorities to carry out radon testing on their own social housing stock, they have long been encouraged to do so.  Specific advice for local authorities in this regard is included on the website, www.radon.ie.  The EPA has also produced a booklet, &lsquo;Guidance Notes to Local Authorities on Implementing a Radon Measurement Programme&rsquo;, which is available at the Agency's website at the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>At the time of the launch of the National Radon Control Strategy (NRCS), it was stated that &lsquo;most local authorities in high radon areas have made very significant progress in testing their social housing stock. To date, approx. 20,000 local authority homes have been measured, and where necessary, remediated&rsquo;.  Comprehensive data on further progress made since then is not available. </p><p>The aim of the Building Regulations is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. In general, Building Regulations apply to the construction of new buildings and to extensions and material alterations to existing buildings. In addition, certain parts of the Regulations apply to existing buildings where a material change of use takes place. Otherwise, Building Regulations do not apply to buildings constructed prior to 1 June 1992.</p><p>The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. These requirements are set out in 12 parts classified as Parts A to M. Part C &ndash; Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture (1997), requires that reasonable precautions shall be taken to avoid danger to health and safety caused by substances (including radon) found on or in the ground to be covered by a building.</p><p>Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the building regulations in practical terms. TGD C contains guidance, compliance with which will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part C.</p><p>Radon is addressed in sections 2.7-17 which require the provision of sumps in all dwellings for remediation in the event of a high radon reading and also for the provision of a radon barrier in areas with a high radon risk. </p><p>Extract 2.10 of the TGD deals with Dwellings (below): </p><p><i>&ldquo;2.10 Dwellings or other long-stay residential buildings</i></p><p><i>(a) High Radon Areas: measures should be taken to protect the building from Radon in the ground. For example, in the case of a noncomplex building of normal design and construction, a fully sealed membrane of low permeability over the entire footprint of the building and a potential means of extracting Radon from the substructure such as a standby Radon sump or sumps with connecting pipework or other appropriate certified systems should be provided.</i></p><p><i>(b) Areas other than High Radon Areas: the building should be provided with a potential means of extracting Radon from the substructure should that prove necessary after construction. For example, in the case of a non-complex building of normal design and construction, the provision of a standby Radon sump or sumps with connecting pipework or other appropriate certified systems should be adequate.&rdquo;</i></p><p>As part of the National Radon Control Strategy, my Department, in conjunction with the EPA's Office of Radiological Protection, developed a training program for the construction industry to aid in the proper installation of  sumps and barriers as per the requirements. Assigned Certifiers under the  Building Control regulations have a responsibility to ensure the correct installation and require certification where considered appropriate. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. The RTB has no role in relation to radon testing.</p><p>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has established an Advisory Group to examine the feasibility and implications of setting minimum thermal efficiency performance standards in properties offered for rent or lease in the residential sector. The Group, on which my Department is represented, will advise DCCAE on how best to progress energy efficiency upgrades in the rental sector and on the approach to public consultation on the issue having regard to the relevant issues.  Key considerations will focus on appropriate approaches to regulation, and the timescale for introduction of any requirements, as well as any associated potential supports.</p></reply>

In December 2016, the Chief State Solicitors Office met with the residents' legal advisers to outline the issues arising and, in order to resolve the matter, invited proposals as to how the sales could be facilitated.  I am advised that this approach did not yield any viable proposals. </p>  <p>  Having taken into consideration the advice of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, my officials have been left with no alternative but to formally withdraw from proceeding with the proposed sales.

Indeed Cyber Security is a standing item on the agenda of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning which I chair. </p>  <p>  The response to cyber threats remains a whole-of-Government challenge, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment taking the lead role and with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the delivery of measures to improve the cyber security of the State.    </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is located in the Department of Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment provides a range of cyber security services to owners of Government IT infrastructure and Critical National Infrastructure. The NCSC is also home to the national Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE) which acts as a national point of contact involving entities within Ireland, and as the point of contact for international discussions on issues of cyber security.  The scope of CSIRT-IE's activities covers prevention, detection, response and mitigation services to Government Departments and State agencies and critical national infrastructure providers. The Defence Forces provide seconded specialists to assist with the work of this team when resources allow. Also, as in any emergency/crisis situation, once Defence systems are supported, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will provide support to the CSIRT-IE team in so far as resources allow.</p></reply>

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. </p>  <p>  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The increases due from 1 January 2018 and 1 October 2018 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. An increase of 1% was paid to personnel earning up &euro;30,000 per annum from 1 January 2019. Further increases in pay are scheduled for later in 2019 and 2020.  </p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the payscales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, will also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to interventions at points 4 and 8 of the relevant pay scales for all such new entrants to the public service. This measure, should it be accepted by the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, will be effective from 1 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a more comprehensive examination of the specific recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Forces, which the Commission identified in Chapter 6 of its report in May 2017. </p>  <p>  The Commission's work is on-going.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arise from the work of the Commission.</p></reply>

This engagement involves the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements. Furthermore, the avoidance of a hard border on the island is fundamental to the Brexit agreement reached in November last between the EU and the UK Government, and there can be no change to the commitments made in that agreement.  As such, there are no plans for a new Army barracks in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.</p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. It is estimated that almost 400,000 people have died, and over 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.</p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November.</p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.</p>  <p>  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November 2018.</p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding was provided in 2018, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.</p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $178 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which provided more than &euro;90 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute throughout 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  Both Governments are determined to find a way beyond the current impasse to get the institutions operating again and I remain in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on how this can be pursued.</p>  <p>  I visited Belfast on 9 and 10 January and held discussions with the leaders of all of the Northern Ireland political parties. These were constructive engagements with each of the party leaders and I emphasised that the two-year absence of the devolved institutions must not continue. There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas, which require a functioning Executive and Assembly. Each of the party leaders confirmed to me their wish to participate in the institutions again and provided views on key concerns and issues for their parties. </p>  <p>  Following these latest consultations, I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving a resolution, but I continue to believe that this can be achieved and that there is an increasingly urgent need for talks to begin.</p>  <p>  The devolved institutions of the Agreement are urgently needed so that the mandated Assembly and power-sharing Executive can represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern, including the challenges for Northern Ireland of the UK decision to exit the European Union. The North South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election, underlines the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.  The Secretary of State and I are agreed that a new political process is needed.  I will continue to work with the Secretary of State and remain in regular contact with the leaders of each of the political parties, to get the necessary political process commenced to secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly.</p>  <p>  I also met in Belfast last week with a range of civil society representatives, including trade unions, business organisations and those working in the education, voluntary and community sectors. In all of these discussions, I heard a clear and unambiguous desire for the Assembly and Executive to operate again and acute concern at the impact of the current impasse for Northern Ireland and for progress with the Peace Process founded on the Good Friday Agreement. There was also serious apprehension on how the challenges raised for Northern Ireland by the UK decision to exit the European Union will be addressed and broad support for the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the UK and the European Union, in particular in providing an absolute guarantee that a hard border will be avoided and that the Good Friday Agreement will be fully protected. I also received a clear message in these civil society engagements that the UK exit from the EU is a further and pressing reason for political leaders to work together through the power-sharing Executive and Assembly, to represent and protect Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique interests and concerns.</p>  <p>  I believe that these calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate have to be heeded.</p></reply>

The normal baseline is the low water mark along the coast.  In 1958, however, following an earlier decision of the International Court of Justice, it was agreed at the UN Conference on the Law of the Sea that in places where a state&rsquo;s coastline is heavily indented, or is screened by a fringe of islands, straight baselines connecting appropriate points on headlands and islands may be drawn.  </p>  <p>  As the configuration of the Irish coastline on the west and south coasts meets these criteria it was decided that Ireland should become one of the first countries in the world to adopt the new system, drawing straight baselines connecting fifty points from Malin Head in Donegal to Carnsore Point in Wexford.  These were set out in the Maritime Jurisdiction (Straight Baselines) Order 1959.  As other parts of the State's coastline do not meet the necessary criteria straight baselines were not drawn in those places.</p>  <p>  The fifty points were resurveyed several years ago using modern survey techniques that allow far more precision than was possible in 1959.  The 2016 Order prescribes an updated and more accurate system of straight baselines drawn between the resurveyed points and replaces the system established by the 1959 Order.  </p></reply>

Vote 28 incorporates the majority of Ireland&rsquo;s 83 diplomatic and consular Missions abroad while Vote 27 encompasses a small number of development-focused Missions, mostly in Africa.</p>  <p>  Total taxi hire costs for both Votes for 2018, including domestic and Mission costs, amount provisionally to &euro;350,625.00.  This amount is based on provisional out-turn figures and are subject to change as we finalise the year end account. </p>  <p>  Given the nature of my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities, officers are obliged to undertake a significant amount of official international travel, often taking place during unsociable hours when the safety and security of Officers necessitates travel by taxi.  Officers across the growing Mission network also travel to frequent meetings and out-of-hours events as part of their core official duties where it may often be only feasible by taxi. </p>  <p>  Travel expenditure is being actively minimised.  Provisional 2018 taxi expenditure was marginally higher than 2017 (&euro;337,872; 3.7%) but this is in the context of increased diplomatic activity at European and international level brought about by Brexit preparations and our United Nations Security Council campaign, an expanded Mission network and a larger workforce.</p>  <p>  Departmental travel policy aims to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.

The 2015 foreign policy review, "Global Island - Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy for a changing world", recognises that human rights violations undermine development. This commits the Department to promote and protect human rights, with an explicit commitment to combat and prevent human trafficking. Ireland has put in place strong legislative, administrative and operational measures, through a multi-agency approach. Ireland is party to UN and Council of Europe instruments to combat this threat and have fully transposed the EU Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims.</p>  <p>  Global Island provides the overall foreign policy framework for the recent public consultation paper on international development, part of the process towards a new policy on international development. </p>  <p>  That public consultation paper reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to upholding human rights and Ireland&rsquo;s international development actions. As part of the contextual analysis underpinning the new development policy, instability and the threats it poses to human rights are identified, factors which facilitate human trafficking. </p>  <p>  In line with our foreign policy, the consultation paper on international development cooperation proposes a focus on protection of poor and vulnerable people living in fragile, crisis and conflict-affected areas, and of people on the move. At recent public consultation meetings there was broad validation of proposals to build on the intersections between Ireland&rsquo;s peacekeeping and conflict resolution work, political engagement, human rights, development cooperation and humanitarian action to combat instability and protect people. The final drafting of the new policy is nearing completion, with a view to maximising the effectiveness of Ireland's international development programmes in all their aspects.</p></reply>

While initially the protests were against the worsening economic situation, they have since developed into calls for President Omar al-Bashir&rsquo;s resignation.</p>  <p>  President Omar al-Bashir has reacted by closing schools and declaring a state of emergency in some regions.  Sudanese police have used tear gas and live ammunition in an attempt to disperse crowds.  It is reported that almost 1,000 people have been arrested across the country since protests began. The Sudanese Government has said that 19 people have been killed during demonstrations, while Sudanese activists and medical workers say that at least double that number were killed.  The use of live fire and arbitrary detention in these circumstances can never be justified.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, fully supports the call on the Government of Sudan, issued by the European External Action Service, to exercise restraint, respect the right to peaceful protest and ensure that all law enforcement and security bodies act under its direct control and in accordance with Sudan's constitutional and international commitments.  The Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which is accredited to Sudan, continues to monitor the situation closely in close cooperation with the Delegation of the European Union in Khartoum.</p>  <p>  In addition to the current unrest, Sudan continues to suffer from a range of humanitarian crises, including protracted conflicts and natural disasters, which feed into the popular disaffection which feed the protests. This humanitarian situation has been further exacerbated by the economic crisis in 2018, leading to severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition across the country. More than 1.8 million people are internally displaced and Sudan hosts a further 1.2 million refugees that have fled conflict in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. As a result, an estimated 5.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year, including 2.6 million children.  Ireland is responding to these crises, with almost &euro;26 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012. </p></reply>

The Withdrawal Agreement sets the terms of the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.

In February 2018, officials from my Department met with the Ambassador of Bahrain in Dublin and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain.</p>  <p>  Ireland has used the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) as a means of keeping human rights issues in Bahrain under examination. Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at the HRC in Geneva. In fact, Ireland has raised Bahrain in its past eight Item 4 Statements (human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention). In Ireland&rsquo;s most recent Item 4 Statement at the HRC session in September 2018, we expressed concerns about 'the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders in Bahrain'. We also called on Bahrain to 'respect freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial'. At the previous HRC session in June 2018, Ireland also raised concerns under Item 4. The EU, in its Item 2 Statement (on the reports of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights), also highlighted the deterioration of the human rights situation, with particular reference to the shrinking of political space in Bahrain. Officials from my Department had previously raised ongoing human rights concerns with Bahrain in the context of its Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva in May 2017.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the rights of prisoners and detainees, Human Rights Council (HRC) Resolution 36/16, which Ireland co-sponsored, calls upon states to &lsquo;investigate promptly, effectively and impartially all alleged human rights violations and abuses suffered by persons deprived of their liberty, in particular cases involving death, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to provide effective remedies to the victims, and to ensure that detention administrations cooperate fully with the investigating authority and preserve all evidence&rsquo;. Ireland has also co-sponsored; Resolutions 36/16 and 30/7, concerning human rights in the administration of justice; Resolution 31/31, concerning torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and UN General Assembly Resolution 71/188, also concerning human rights in the administration of justice. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make tangible progress in the human rights sphere. Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights will continue to be raised directly with the Bahraini authorities, and at EU and international levels, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

This is a priority for the Government, given the importance of the landbridge in getting Irish products, in particular agrifood products,  to market on continental Europe. This is an important issue with regard to protecting the competitiveness of our producers and ensuring continued unhampered access to the EU Single Market. </p>  <p>  The importance of maintaining the landbridge has been recognised and agreed through the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement which reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate the efficient and timely transit through the UK of goods moving from Ireland to another EU Member State or another country, or vice versa.</p>  <p>  To this end, I welcome the EU's agreement that the UK may join the Common Transit Convention upon its departure from the EU, and the number of formal steps taken to allow this to happen on 4 December 2018. The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Travel Convention will play an important role in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s access to other EU Member States via the UK landbridge.</p>  <p>  The second strand is our work with the European Commission and other affected Member States (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code. </p>  <p>  The Landbridge Project Group has been instrumental in ensuring progress has been made in both strands of work. It is chaired by my Department, and involves all relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners,  the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health, and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  The Landbridge Project Group has met four times to date in its full format, (9 October 2017, 15 November 2017, 24 May 2018,  and 1 October 2018). The group is also operated by e-mail and therefore there is regular and ongoing contact among Members of the group. </p>  <p>  In addition to the full meetings of the Project Group where officials from all relevant Departments are present, groups of Departments also meet in smaller formats to discuss specific landbridge issues, where appropriate. Members of the Project Group have also met with other relevant Member States and the European Commission to discuss the landbridge at a technical level.</p>  <p>  Relevant Departments have also been tasked by the Government to roll out detailed Action Plans with a view to advancing, as appropriate, the mitigating measures which have been identified in the areas of their responsibility from the planning to the implementation phase.  In line with this approach, the Government has already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focused on East-West trade which will also take account of the continued use of the landbridge.  </p></reply>

In line with Section 2 of the Passports Act, guardianship is a term with a defined legal meaning and there are many circumstances in which a person, whether in the context of a same-sex or opposite-sex relationship, may play a role in the upbringing of a child without being a guardian as defined by law.</p>  <p>  In cases where a child has only one guardian within the meaning of the legislation, this guardian is required to complete a Sole Guardian Affidavit to confirm that there is no other person holding guardianship rights in respect of the child applying for a passport.

This arose originally because of the role of the relevant Iranian banks in evading international sanctions on sales of weapons and controlled technologies. </p>  <p>  This problem had begun to ease following the removal of many sanctions in 2016, but has now come to the fore again following the re-imposition by the United States of national sanctions on Iran. These do not prohibit all financial transfers, but there has been a general chilling effect on the willingness of many European banks to handle funds going to or from Iran. EU sanctions have not been re-imposed.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing at EU level, including in discussion with other states, to devise means to allow such transfers to continue without going through the US financial system. This is a complex and difficult area, but it is being actively and urgently pursued.

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her. Entitlement to Irish citizenship is in turn determined by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, under which and in general, Irish citizenship may be obtained by birth in certain circumstances, by descent, or by naturalisation.</p>  <p>  As no details have been supplied about the UK citizen in question, it is not possible to provide specific guidance on their case. Nonetheless, we can advise on the general rules and procedures that apply to cases such as these.</p>  <p>  A person born on the island of Ireland before 1 January 2005 is an Irish citizen. Citizenship for persons born on the island of Ireland after that date is subject to certain conditions. A person born abroad is automatically an Irish citizen if one of their parents was an Irish citizen born in Ireland. There is an additional requirement of registration in the Foreign Births Register (FBR) for a person born outside Ireland where his/her Irish citizen parent had also been born outside the island of Ireland. In such cases, Irish citizenship commences after inclusion on the FBR. </p>  <p>  Individuals who are unable to establish an entitlement to citizenship by descent may still be able to apply for citizenship through naturalisation.

This is the best way to ensure that the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU are maintained post Brexit. This includes the rights of frontier workers. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely conscious of the concerns of border communities and of cross-border workers as a result of Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The continuation of the Common Travel Area (CTA) is also important in that context.  </p>  <p>  The Common Travel Area is a long-standing arrangement between Ireland and the UK which means Irish citizens can move freely to live, work, and study in the UK on the same basis as UK citizens and vice versa.  It is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and the continuation of this arrangement is a stated commitment of both the Irish and UK Governments.  In the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, it is important that any arrangements necessary to maintain the Common Travel Area are made. </p>  <p>  The Common Travel Area provides for associated rights and entitlements which enable Irish and UK citizens to move freely between and reside in both jurisdictions.  These rights and entitlements include access to employment, healthcare, education, and social benefits, as well as the right to vote in certain elections.  The CTA pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on it. It is recognised in Protocol 20 to the EU Treaties and is also acknowledged in the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland to the Agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU which was endorsed by the European Council and the UK Government on 25 November 2018.  </p>  <p>  The maintenance of the CTA is a bilateral matter.  Work is at an advanced stage both with the UK and domestically to ensure that the necessary provisions are made in both jurisdictions so that the CTA continues to function effectively after the UK leaves the EU.   </p></reply>

The shift to preparing for a no deal Brexit requires the acceleration of certain measures already identified and underway, the putting in place of possible temporary solutions which can be rapidly implemented and potential crisis response measures.</p>  <p>  Accordingly a number of the actions identified in a no deal scenario will still be required even in a central case scenario, including the Withdrawal Agreement with a transition period and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and the political declaration on the future relationship, but with a longer timeframe for implementation.</p>  <p>  A no deal Brexit would be highly disruptive and would have profound political, economic and legal implications for Ireland, the rest of the EU and, most significantly, for the UK itself. It is not the outcome we want and our focus continues to be on securing ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. </p></reply>

Advice and guidance on these channels and other useful information on passports is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.dfa.ie/passport. </p>  <p>  The award-winning Online Passport Renewal Service  was launched in March 2017 and offers the convenience of an online application system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for Irish citizens anywhere in the world, without the need for application forms, printed photos or witnesses. </p>  <p>  The Online Passport Renewal Service has recently expanded to include the online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, to introduce a passport card for children and to expand the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. The service brings significant benefits for citizens with faster turnaround times of 10 working days for all online applications, excluding postage. In addition, the cost of renewing a passport online is significantly cheaper than alternative methods, with fees for all online applications being reduced by &euro;5 across all application types. The expanded service is now available to all adults and children who wish to renew their passport.</p>  <p>  Those who cannot, or do not wish to, apply online have the option of applying through their local post office with more than 1000 post offices across the State offering this service. The Northern Ireland Passport Express service offers an equivalent service to those living in Northern Ireland from more than 70 of its post offices.</p>  <p>  Bearing in mind the availability of both the online and postal application channels, very few citizens living in the island of Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service.</p>  <p>  Therefore taking into account all these circumstances, I am satisfied that the range of options available meets the current needs of passport applicants without the establishment of a further passport office.</p></reply>

Ireland strongly supports this commitment. </p><p>They make clear the EU's firm determination to work speedily on an agreement, that establishes alternative arrangements by the end of 2020, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered.  </p><p>They underline that, if the backstop were triggered, it would apply temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement that ensures that a hard border is avoided. In such a case, the EU would use its best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop so that the backstop would only be in place for as long as strictly necessary. </p><p>This is also clearly reflected in the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement, as well as the text of the political declaration on the future relationship. </p><p>As the Conclusions and joint letter demonstrate, the EU has been responsive to concerns raised by Prime Minister May, and has provided clarifications in order to facilitate the next steps of the process, while being clear that they are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the Withdrawal Agreement. </p></reply>

The worsening crisis is causing mass migration that creates challenges to host communities and to regional stability. </p>  <p>  This crisis is having a dire impact on the Venezuelan population both inside and outside the country, and on the neighbouring countries that are receiving ever increasing numbers of Venezuelan migrants and refugees. The UN estimates that the number of Venezuelans who have left their country since 2015 has reached over three million, with the majority of these travelling to nearby countries in the region. </p>  <p>  Humanitarian needs are acute, with severe shortages of food and medicine leading to high rates of malnutrition and the spread of illness and disease. I am particularly concerned by the humanitarian dimension of the crisis, and I urge the Government of Venezuela to acknowledge the full extent of that crisis and allow humanitarian actors to operate without interference. </p>  <p>  Neighbouring countries hosting Venezuelan migrants are carrying an enormous burden and must be supported. The situation is particularly acute in Colombia, which has received over one million Venezuelans. In addition, large numbers of Colombians, formerly economic migrants in Venezuela, have returned home to Colombia. </p>  <p>  Ireland is fully supportive of the &euro;55 million funding that has been committed by the EU for humanitarian assistance. This funding supports the EU response to help the most vulnerable, and support the reception capacities of the host communities in the region. The EU's assistance, delivered through partners on the ground, focuses on emergency healthcare, food aid, shelter and protection for the most vulnerable families affected by the crisis.</p>  <p>  I, along with my EU partners, have repeatedly called on the Venezuelan Government to engage in dialogue with the opposition, to respect the electoral calendar and to fully restore the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions. It is regrettable to see the Venezuelan Government not heed these calls for fresh presidential elections in accordance with internationally recognised democratic standards and the Venezuelan constitutional order. </p>  <p>  On 10 January, President Maduro started a new mandate on the basis of non-democratic elections. Ireland was not represented at the inauguration, and fully supports the declaration by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini of 10 January. This statement reiterates that the May 2018 presidential election was neither free nor fair, and that its outcome lacked credibility. The statement also urges President Maduro to recognise and respect the role and independence of the democratically elected National Assembly, to release all political prisoners, to uphold the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to urgently address the needs of the population. </p>  <p>  Ireland also regrets the negative impact the assumption of this new mandate may have on the possibility of a negotiated solution to this crisis. It is my continued belief that credible and meaningful dialogue is the most effective means of achieving a peaceful negotiated solution to the crisis currently affecting the country. To that end, it will be vital that the EU remains engaged with all stakeholders in Venezuela.</p>  <p>  The EU is currently exploring the potential of setting up an International Contact Group (ICG) for Venezuela. This group would consist of the EU, a number of EU MS, and other important actors with varying political views on the situation in Venezuela. The ICG would not have the role of a mediator, but rather would aim to facilitate a solution to the crisis. The role is envisaged as mainly assisting in putting conditions in place to allow for a political process to take place. I would welcome the establishment of an ICG and I hope that it will be a useful vehicle for information sharing and encouraging dialogue.</p>  <p>  The situation in Venezuela continues to be discussed at the highest levels within the EU and was discussed by Foreign Ministers at our meeting on 10 December. I welcome the high priority given to the issue by the EU, and I believe that it is important for us to work in step with our like-minded regional partners.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Mexico is responsible for our diplomatic relations with Venezuela and is monitoring the situation closely, engaging with partner organisations on the ground and with EU Missions in Caracas. Ireland will continue to engage regularly with our EU partners on this issue, as well as with affected countries in the region.</p></reply>

Ultimately, the long-standing and very deeply rooted tensions and divisions in Rakhine State can only be solved through dialogue and an inclusive political process. The report of the Kofi Annan-led Advisory Commission on Rakhine State is an important tool in this regard providing a roadmap for sustainable peace building and development for the benefit of all civilians.

This right, which is replicated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, includes freedom to change one&rsquo;s religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private and to manifest one&rsquo;s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur and who the victims are. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to promoting and protecting human rights, including freedom of thought, conscience and religion through our work at the EU, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.  Ireland also uses the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a mechanism of the Human Rights Council, to remind countries under review of their obligation to advance fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of religion or belief, under international human rights law. </p>  <p>  At EU level, Ireland played a key role in the adoption by the European Union of guidelines on freedom of religion or belief during our Presidency in 2013. These guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of this right in the EU's external human rights policy.</p>  <p>  Addressing the high level segment of the 37th session of the Human Rights Council in February 2018, my colleague, Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development, Ciaran Cannon highlighted threats to freedom of religion and belief and minority religious communities worldwide, including those of Christian, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i faiths.</p>  <p>  At the same session of the Council, Ireland participated in the Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Mr. Ahmed Shaheed, welcoming the work he has undertaken to date and assuring him of Ireland&rsquo;s continuing support for his mandate. </p>  <p>  Most recently at the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in November 2018, Ireland supported the EU led resolution on freedom of religion or belief and we also participated in an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, during which we condemned restrictions placed on fundamental human rights, including the right to freedom or religion or belief, by using national legislation to enforce such measures in the name of national security.  </p></reply>

We are committed to constantly improving how we conduct our business and to ensuring that our staff across all offices, both in Ireland and our global network of Embassies and Consulates, act in a highly professional manner at all times.</p><p>My Department is fully committed to investigating and responding to every complaint within a timeframe of 20 days.  If a complainant is not satisfied with the explanation or the outcome, he or she can request a review by writing to the Central Coordination Unit of the Department.</p><p>Within my Department, the Passport Service received more than 733,000 and 780,000 passport applications in 2016 and 2017 respectively.  In 2018, in excess of 862,000 applications were received. With this volume of applications, the Passport Service deals with the highest number of customers of any of the Divisions within my Department.  </p><p>The Passport Service recorded the following number of complaints for the each of the years requested which were addressed directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. of complaints</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>118</td></tr></table></p><p>There were also a number of complaints received via the Office of the Ombudsman, none of which were upheld by that Office:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. of complaints</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>10</td></tr></table></p><p>The complaints received fall into the following broad categories:</p><p>Communication (e.g: Difficulties in communicating with the office, lack of clear information)</p><p>Processing times (e.g: Inadequate processing times)</p><p>Customer service (e.g: Poor customer service, errors on Passport data page, loss of documents)</p><p>Among the measures taken to ensure improved customer service and, in particular, the management of overall demand and seasonal application increases are the recruitment of additional staff, targeted overtime, re-organisation of production process and administrative arrangements and the continuous implementation of service improvements through the Passport Reform programme. </p><p>Each year the Passport Service recruits over 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) to assist in processing passport applications and deal with the queries from the general public. For 2019, over 230 TCOs will be assigned to the Passport Service to deal with the increased volume anticipated during the peak season.  A dedicated Customer Service Hub has been established to deal with queries from the public.  The number of staff that will be answering queries in the Customer Service Hub will have trebled since 2016.  In addition to the normal seasonal intake of temporary staff, more than 50 additional permanent staff are being assigned to the Customer Service Hub.  </p><p>The Passport Reform Programme continues to deliver major upgrades to the Passport Service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.  The online passport application service, which was launched in March 2017 for adults renewing their passport, has been expanded to other adult renewal categories and for children since November 2018.  This expansion means more than half of all passport applicants are now eligible to renew online. The online passport renewal service bring benefits for customers with faster turnaround times of 10 working days, excluding post.  In addition, the costs of renewing a passport online is cheaper than alternative methods, with fees for all online applications reduced by &euro;5 across all application types. </p><p>I am satisfied that these additional resources and the improvements in technology will bring about a greater level of customer satisfaction with faster turnaround times and greater access to information. </p></reply>

Most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm and when a loan is sold on to another regulated entity, the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply. However, as Minister for Finance, I am unable to interfere with any commercial decision of a financial entity.</p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 ensures that the protections which applied before a loan was sold will continue to apply. The recently enacted Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 will require that loan owners are regulated by the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  There are both practical and commercial reasons why it would not be appropriate to allow borrowers to purchase loans for the same rate that they are sold to funds.   </p>  <p>  It is incumbent on the seller of loans to obtain the best price it can for them to improve the bank's capital position and enable it to continue lending to the real economy. Management may take the decision that it is more efficient and cost effective to make a single bulk sale than multiple individual sales with no certainty about completions.  Disclosing the price is an extremely commercially sensitive issue and could lead to a breakdown of repayments. The rights and obligations of the borrower remain unchanged but the borrower may be less inclined to meet these obligations if they are aware of the discount which may have applied.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the discount often applies at a loan book level and specific discounts are not applied to individual loans. There can be wide variances for individual loans from the aggregate amount.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting people in mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and there are a range of supports and services in place to assist people in that regard, including the Mortgage to Rent scheme; the personal insolvency system; and the Abhaile service which provides those in mortgage arrears with access to free financial and/or legal advice from professionals to advise them on their situation. </p></reply>

If a property owner repays the value of their loan, as occurred in this case, then NAMA no longer holds any security over the owner&rsquo;s property. Thereafter, it is entirely a matter for the owner, in conjunction with the planning authorities, to determine how the property should be utilised. </p>  <p>  NAMA was established as an independent commercial body and I do not have a role in its operations or decisions, or in relation to the properties securing its loans.

However, the section was identified by Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission as being interpreted in a small number of instances as applying in all situations, and as conferring the right on appellants to require the Tax Appeals Commission to require disclosure of all of Revenue&rsquo;s documentation on a particular taxpayer or matter, regardless of whether the Commissioners considered that this was required to determine the particular appeal.</p>  <p>  The removal of Section 949AG precludes any assertion that it should apply in all situations, even in those where there is no statutory requirement for the Appeal Commissioners to have regard to the same matters to which Revenue was required to have regard. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that legislation provides the Tax Appeals Commission with a wide range of other powers to require appellants and Revenue to supply information to assist the Appeal Commissioners in their adjudication and determination of an appeal.  It is considered that these powers are sufficiently extensive to allow for the effective operation of the appeals process. However, I can confirm that officials in my Department will keep this matter under review over the coming year, and further amendments will be considered in future if a need is identified.</p>  <p>  Legislative change in respect of section 949AG was discussed with both the Appeal Commissioners and Revenue. Both indicated that they had no objection to the deletion of section 949AG. </p>  <p>  There is no plan to revert to allowing appellants the right to take a case to the Circuit Court following a determination from the Appeal Commissioners. This feature of the old tax appeals system (pre 2016) allowed for a complete rehearing of an appeal, as if the Appeal Commissioners had never made their determination. It resulted in additional delays, particularly in regard to appeals outside the Dublin circuit, where it is difficult to get a case listed for hearing. It also had the effect of undermining the Appeal Commissioners&rsquo; stage of the process where a taxpayer would not fully engage and used the initial hearing as a dry run for the Circuit Court. Moreover, the right to a complete rehearing encouraged taxpayers to re-lodge an appeal, even in circumstances where there were no real grounds for dissatisfaction with the Appeal Commissioners' determination. This runs counter to the principle that cases should be resolved as quickly and effectively as possible and took up valuable court time &ndash; a scarce resource.</p>  <p>  The reformed appeal system allows more flexible and active case management by the Appeal Commissioners, including written and published determinations and a revised case stated procedure. When appeal proceedings were conducted in the Circuit Court, formal written determinations of the Appeal Commissioners were rarely given and were not generally published. Under the current system, written determinations are made in all cases and published online.</p>  <p>  Following the independent review of the operations and governance structures of the Tax Appeals Commission last year, significant additional resources are being provided to the Commission to allow them to recruit more staff (as per a recommendation of the review) and acquire a new case management system. These measures will help the Commission to address the current backlog of appeals.</p></reply>

The Examination requires all lenders, which offered tracker interest rate mortgages to their customers, to review all mortgage accounts, including accounts in arrears, to identify any tracker related failings both from a contractual and transparency perspective.  </p>  <p>  At the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in October, the Governor of the Central Bank confirmed that, as of August 31st, lenders have identified circa 38,400 affected customers (including cases resolved pre-Examination following Central Bank intervention), and paid &euro;580 million in redress and compensation.  The redress and compensation phases of the Examination are now significantly advanced: 93 percent of affected customer accounts already identified and verified had received offers of redress and compensation by August 31st.  </p>  <p>  As part of the Examination framework, where customer detriment has been identified, the Central Bank has clearly articulated its expectations of lenders to provide appropriate redress and compensation to all impacted customers in line with prescribed Principles for Redress, including:</p>  <p>  -  2.1. Redress will result in impacted customers being returned to the position that they would have been in had the relevant issue not arisen.</p>  <p>  -  2.2. Compensation is to be reasonable and must reflect the detriment involved arising from and/or associated with being on an incorrect rate (such compensation to reflect the specific circumstances of each impacted customer).</p>  <p>  An important part of the Examination Framework is the requirement for lenders to establish independent Appeals Panels, specifically to deal with customers who are not satisfied with any aspect of the redress and compensation offers that they receive from lenders.  The appeals process is additional to the options of bringing a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or initiating court proceedings.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank indicates that its supervisory review of conduct of the Tracker Examination is significantly advanced and that a further update on the Examination will be published in early 2019. </p></reply>

The Irish banks have made significant progress in this regard since the height of the crisis with NPLs at the banks in which the State has a shareholding reducing by 70% from &euro;54bn to &euro;16bn at end-June 2018. A major contributor to this has been the almost 136,000 mortgage restructures that have been put in place. </p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the NPL ratios at the Irish banks remain at an elevated level and are well above the European average of around 4%. PTSB is a particular outlier and had a ratio of 16% even after the bank&rsquo;s loan sale &ndash; Project Glas &ndash; which was announced last July. Project Glenbeigh &ndash; PTSB&rsquo;s second NPL transaction of 2018 announced on 29th November, will achieve a further significant reduction in the bank&rsquo;s NPL ratio to below 10%. </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale, either by way of securitisation or otherwise, remain unchanged. Start Mortgages, who purchased the Glas portfolio in July and Pepper, who now hold legal title to the Glenbeigh mortgages and who will act as servicer and administrator of the mortgages, are both regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. When dealing with borrowers, these firms are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears. Furthermore, it has been confirmed in the case of this latest transaction that the terms of an agreed restructure will continue to be honoured.</p>  <p>  In addition, earlier this year I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The result of this review was published in October and it is encouraging to note that the key findings included confirmation that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to highlight that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of the banks&rsquo; is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.</p></reply>

The Examination requires all lenders, which offered tracker interest rate mortgages to their customers, to review all mortgage accounts, including accounts in arrears, to identify any tracker related failings both from a contractual and transparency perspective.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has indicated that, as at end August 2018, lenders have identified circa 38,400 impacted customers.  However, following the reviews conducted by lenders, certain customers have been deemed as not impacted under the Examination.

In accordance with section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, where an employee is necessarily obliged to incur and defray out of the emoluments of the employment expenses of travelling in the performance of the duties of the employment, or otherwise to expend money wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of those duties, there may be deducted from the emoluments of the employee to be assessed to income tax the expenses so necessarily incurred and defrayed.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that arising from an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to a tax deduction under that provision in respect of certain expenses, there exists a long-standing Revenue practice under which employers may reimburse tax-free to employees the expenses of travel (and subsistence relating to that travel), subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.  The conditions under which the reimbursement to employees of the expenses of travel and subsistence may generally be made without deduction of tax are as follows: </p><p>(a)  firstly, the employee must be temporarily away from his/her normal place of work in the performance of the duties of his/her employment;</p><p>(b)  secondly, the travel expenses must be necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, and</p><p>(c)  thirdly, arising from a long-accepted position, supported by tax case law, the expenses of subsistence must attach to travelling necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment.</p><p>Moreover, provided the employee bears the cost of all expenses<b></b>of travel necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of his/her employment (and bears the cost of subsistence relating to such travel), Revenue will disregard for income tax purposes the reimbursement of expenses of travel and subsistence, where such reimbursement is made by way of:</p><p>(a)  a flat rate up to, but not exceeding, the prevailing Civil Service rates for travel and subsistence, or</p><p>(b)  a flat rate based on any other schedule of rates and related conditions of travel and subsistence, which do no more than reimburse the employee for actual expenditure necessarily incurred.</p><p>Revenue and my Department have noted the comments of the Appeal Commissioner in the case concerned (Tax Appeals Commission Determination 20TACD2018 refers). Revenue has published extensive guidance on the Tax Treatment of the Reimbursement of Expenses of Travel and Subsistence to Office Holders and Employees &ndash; Part 05-01-06 of the Tax and Duty Manual refers &ndash; and, notwithstanding the Appeal Commissioner&rsquo;s comments, has no plans to alter its practice or published guidance on this matter. </p><p>In all the circumstances, I do not see that there is a need to consider a legislative amendment to section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. </p></reply>

The debate was held in public session.   </p>  <p>  An agreement was not reached, with several Member States, including Ireland, expressing reservations about the proposal.

Many regulated financial service providers meet this need in Ireland and provide cIredit of various duration and price for a variety of purposes.  Licensed moneylenders are part of this credit landscape and provide credit to consumers who are often unable to obtain credit from another cheaper source for various reasons. </p><p>A number of members within the credit union movement in Ireland offer the Personal Micro Credit (PMC) Scheme.  This began as a pilot scheme, supported by Government, in November 2015. Loans under the initiative are branded &quot;It Makes Sense&quot; loans. The PMC Implementation Group was established to oversee and drive the implementation of the scheme through its pilot phase and subsequently through to implementation nationwide. My Department is represented on the PMC Implementation Group, which is chaired by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p><p>It should be noted that credit unions are independent and it is at management discretion if they sign up to offer the &quot;It Makes Sense&quot; loan to consumers. Additionally credit unions can only lend within their common bonds. Currently <i>48% </i>of credit unions are involved in the PMC scheme and, therefore, only consumers within the common bond of these credit unions can avail of the &ldquo;It Makes Sense&rdquo; loan. As a result the &quot;It Makes Sense&quot; loan is not yet available as a nationwide mainstream alternative of affordable credit for current users of licensed moneylenders.</p><p>Anyone wishing to engage in the business of moneylending requires a licence from the Central Bank in accordance with the Consumer Credit Act 1995 (the Act) and the Central Bank assesses applications in line with the criteria set out in the Act. The Act provides that the Central Bank can refuse to grant a licence to a moneylender if it is of the opinion that the cost of credit is excessive.  </p><p>One of the specific challenges that the Bank faces in considering rates charged by licensed moneylenders on specific loans is finding a balance between, on the one hand, the availability of credit for people who do not have access to legitimate credit elsewhere or who do not use other regulated credit providers and, on the other hand, the provision of short term unsecured loans at what can be a high cost. </p><p>There is a strong framework of protection in place for consumers who choose to avail of the services of licensed moneylenders including the Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders. </p><p>In March 2018, the Central Bank proposed new measures to enhance the framework of protections for customers of moneylenders, including </p><p>- Measures aimed at further ensuring that moneylenders adopt and implement a responsible lending culture.</p><p>- Moneylenders to prompt consumers to consider alternatives, including cheaper options, to moneylending loans.</p><p>- Measures to reduce the possibility of consumers over-extending themselves when borrowing from moneylenders.</p><p>The Bank undertook a public consultation on the proposals and it expects to finalise and publish Regulations under Section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, to replace the Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders, in 2019.</p></reply>

My Department has been to the forefront in assessing the impact of Brexit on our economy, commissioning joint research with the ESRI on the issue even prior to the referendum taking place. It is clear from this research and further studies, that a hard Brexit will have a considerable negative impact for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Government has already taken a number of important steps to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit. The Government has been building resilience through the creation of fiscal capacity, including by balancing the books and reducing our debt burden, building resilience to economic shocks through the establishment of the &lsquo;Rainy Day Fund&rsquo;. The fund is intended to act as an economic buffer in the event of a particularly severe economic downturn. </p>  <p>  Our recent economic history highlights the importance of creating a fiscal safety buffer to help absorb inevitable shocks, at the same time, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the public finances.</p>  <p>  The Government is also providing dedicated loan funds for affected businesses. As the Deputy will be aware, I announced a &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme in Budget 2018 to provide support to Irish SMEs to diversify and restructure their businesses in light of Brexit. This Scheme was launched at the end of March of last year. Following on from the successful launch of the Brexit Loan Scheme, as part of Budget 2019 I announced the development of the Future Growth Loan Scheme of up to &euro;300m to provide long-term investment finance of 8-10 years to help Irish businesses invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment. I anticipate that this Scheme will be launched early this year. </p>  <p>  The measures introduced in Budget 2019 continue the process of ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s economy remains competitive and resilient against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty, including from Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government and State agencies will also continue working hard to exploit any opportunities from Brexit, including promoting trade and investment opportunities in Ireland, as an English speaking member of the EU with unfettered access to the EU market. </p>  <p>  At the sectoral level new opportunities have been identified &ndash; particularly in the international financial services sector which is heavily reliant on access to the Single Market and ongoing compliance with EU regulatory standards. Brexit has already seen opportunities for Ireland to increase its share of financial services-based inward investment. Public announcements to establish or expand operations have been made by a number of companies. </p>  <p>  With regard to business registrations, I am advised by Revenue that the numbers of companies and businesses registering for Corporation Tax and Income Tax has been increasing in recent years. However, it is not possible to identify those registering as a result of Brexit separately from normal growth and expansion of the Irish economy.</p>  <p>   I am further advised that Revenue provides an easy to use on-line facility that allows new customers to register for their taxes online. This facility can cater for significant numbers of new registrations if the need arises. </p>  <p>   As the Deputy is aware, forecasts of tax receipts are produced by the Department of Finance with assistance from Revenue. The role of Revenue is to advise of any potential increases and decreases in taxation that they have been made aware of from administering the taxes and other data sources available to them. Revenue are not currently aware of any significant increases in tax receipts expected as a result of increased investment due to Brexit. </p></reply>

However, a longstanding concession provided through Revenue guidance permitted the zero rating of certain types of food supplements including vitamins, minerals and fish oils. The operation of the current concession became extremely problematic because of efforts by certain businesses in the industry to exploit the concession to extend zero rating way beyond the scope permitted by Revenue. These businesses consistently challenged Revenue guidance and Revenue decisions on the VAT rating of products giving rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  Revenue published new guidance on 27 December concerning the rate of VAT that applies to food supplements.  The new guidance withdraws the concessionary application of the zero rate to certain food supplements provided for in previous guidance and these products will be liable at the standard rate from the 1 March 2019. </p>  <p>  However, independent of Revenue&rsquo;s decisions on interpretation, I agreed during the recent Finance Bill to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group Paper to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products, licenced by the Health Products Regulatory Association will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated. </p></reply>

This Directive provides that Member States may apply reduced rates of excise for small beer producers and also for small distilleries (spirit drinks producers). Ireland has exercised the option to apply reduced rates of excise for small beer producers. </p>  <p>  Having regard to public health concerns, Directive 92/83/EEC set the production threshold for the application of excise relief for small distilleries at 10 hectoliters of pure alcohol per annum. In fact only seven Member States apply an excise relief for small distilleries and the commercial viability of such a scale of production was found by the European Commission to be very limited, most beneficial to ancillary producers.   </p>  <p>  A proposal to amend the current Directive 92/83/EEC was published by the European Commission in 2018. The legislative proposal includes an option for Member States to apply reduced rates of excise for cider and other fermented drinks, but it does not amend the existing small distilleries threshold nor is there any discernible interest among Member States in making any such amendment.  </p></reply>

In line with my Department's commitment to evidence based policy-making, the inclusion of these additional four cities followed the completion of a comprehensive, independent ex-ante cost benefit analyses. </p>  <p>  The specific Special Regeneration Areas for the Living City Initiative in each city were designated following consultation with the relevant city councils and an independent review by a third party advisor. Specific criteria were set down in respect of the areas that should be included within the remit of the Living City Initiative which were required to be taken into account by the relevant city councils when putting forward the proposed Special Regeneration Areas for each city. In particular, Special Regeneration Areas should be inner city areas which are largely comprised of dwellings built before 1915, where there is above average unemployment and which demonstrate clear evidence of neglect, dereliction and under-use. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department reviewed the Living City Initiative in 2016 in consultation with the relevant councils and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. On foot of that review, a number of changes were brought forward to the scheme in Budget 2017 in order to make the initiative more attractive and effective. The principal change extended the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who are now able to claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property, which was built prior to 1915, where such property is to be used for residential purposes. In addition, the requirement for a pre-1915 building to have been originally constructed for use as a dwelling in order to qualify for the residential element of the Initiative was removed. The floor area restriction for owner-occupiers has also been removed, while the minimum amount of capital expenditure required for eligibility for relief, under all elements of the scheme, was also amended and must now only exceed &euro;5,000. </p>  <p>  The aim is to get the design of the Initiative right so that it can work in an effective manner. Once it is proven that this have been achieved, it will then be possible to consider if and how the Initiative should be extended to other locations. Unless the underpinning scheme is made more effective, extension of eligibility for it to other towns would be largely ineffective.</p></reply>

The annual breakdown is set out in the table below.

This is because, owing to the maturity extensions granted in 2013, it is not expected that Ireland will have to refinance any EFSM loans before 2027.  In total, over the period from 2019 to 2025, this reduces the refinancing requirement by &euro;8.2bn to &euro;73 billion  <i>.</i></p><p>While the vast bulk of Ireland&rsquo;s National Debt is at fixed rates of interest the cost of refinancing that debt could become more expensive if interest rates were to rise. </p><p>However, it should be noted that the debt interest estimates set out in Budget 2019 are based on prudent assumptions and already allow for an increase in rates on Exchequer borrowing over the forecast period.</p></reply>

A recent High Court judgement held that a person inheriting a dwelling house cannot have a beneficial interest in a dwelling house forming part of the residue of an estate until the assets for distribution have been ascertained; that is, on a later date than the date of the inheritance. </p>  <p>  The facts of the relevant case were that an individual had inherited more than one dwelling house from the same disponer and both dwelling houses formed part of the residue of the estate. The judge held that the individual did not have a beneficial interest in either of the dwelling houses at the date of the inheritance and qualifies for the exemption. Revenue have issued revised guidance on foot of the judgement to clarify that a dwelling house forming part of the residue of an estate is not to be taken into account in determining whether a successor has an interest in another dwelling house at the date of an inheritance. </p>  <p>  Due to the nature of the information supplied on the capital acquisitions tax return it is not possible to provide an estimate as requested by the Deputy.

These circumstances typically occur where an employee has not provided a valid Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) to an employer or where it is an employee&rsquo;s first employment in the State. Also, in very rare circumstances emergency tax could apply because an employee&rsquo;s tax record needs to be updated, which could prevent Revenue from issuing a &lsquo;Revenue<i></i>Payroll Notification&rsquo; (RPN). The RPN is the mechanism through which Revenue provides employers with real-time information in respect of employees&rsquo; tax credit and rate band entitlements. </p><p>Revenue has confirmed that by 11 January 2019, employers had successfully submitted pay and statutory deduction details in respect of over 1.54m employees under the new PAYE Modernisation arrangements. Of these, approximately 23,000 (1.5%) individuals were reported as being on emergency tax. It is not possible to directly compare this figure with the 2018 tax year because employers were not previously required to provide information on instances where emergency tax was applied.  </p><p>Revenue has further advised me that from analysis of the submissions received to date, it is clear that some employers are unnecessarily operating emergency tax in respect of employees where an RPN is available. However, the analysis also confirms that many employers who incorrectly operated emergency tax in their first payroll run of the year have since corrected the error and applied the correct details to their employees&rsquo; second week&rsquo;s earnings and refunded any overpayments.</p><p>Revenue has assured me that it will continue to very actively monitor PAYE Modernisation payroll submissions and will make direct contact with employers who appear not to be operating the system properly to assist them rectifying any errors made. Revenue also expects that the numbers of employees being placed on emergency tax will decrease further once the system beds down and employers become used to operating on a real-time basis. </p><p>Finally, I wish to commend Revenue for the successful launch of PAYE Modernisation and the seamless integration of the new real-time reporting arrangements into employers&rsquo; payroll systems.</p></reply>

The Act prescribes that the ICCL shall pay compensation to clients of the aforementioned categories of investment firms (&ldquo;compensation obligation&rdquo;).  The compensation obligation of the ICCL is restricted to &ldquo;eligible clients&rdquo;, in essence clients, that are not defined in the Act as excluded investors, such as professional and institutional investors, including among others a pension or retirement fund. </p><p>In respect of eligible clients&rsquo; investments, the compensation obligation relates to eligible client money held, and, eligible client investment instruments held, administered and managed in connection with the provision of certain investment services, that the failed investment firm is unable to return to the eligible investor in accordance with legal and contractual conditions applicable.

I am advised by DEASP that the PA provides certain protections to members of an occupational pension scheme in the event of the insolvency of their employer.</p><p>Specifically<b></b>S48A of the PA provides a liability in law for the Minister for Finance to make payments of certain certified amounts to the trustees of an occupational pension scheme where the resources of the scheme are not sufficient to discharge liabilities in relation to certain benefits. In order to be eligible for such a payment, there must be a double insolvency of both the employer and the pension scheme. </p><p>Section 48A operates in the event of the wind up of a pension scheme, where both the employer and the scheme are insolvent at the date of wind up, and the scheme has insufficient funds to meet the liabilities of a scheme in respect of benefits referred to in S48(1AB) paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of the PA, the Minister for Finance will provide monies from the Exchequer to fund the shortfall. The shortfall being 50% of the benefits, and where the annual amount is &euro;12,000 or less, 100% of the benefits.</p><p>Regarding the proposed implementation of an Auto-Enrolment scheme, my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has primary responsibility in this area. However, I have been informed that the detailed evidence building and consultation required to deliver an automatic enrolment system is now being undertaken over an initial project planning phase. This will include an investigation of the potential organisational models for delivery and the likely costs involved.</p><p>Until this work is complete and a preferred model chosen, it would not be possible to confirm the specific operational structure and design characteristics of automatic enrolment.</p></reply>

However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of repaying the State&rsquo;s contingent liability, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA.</p>  <p>  While it is currently estimated that NAMA will return a surplus in the region of &euro;3.5bn to the Exchequer, this surplus has yet to fully crystallise. It is important to note that realisation of this surplus depends on the success of NAMA's ongoing deleveraging, its Dublin Docklands SDZ programme and residential funding programme.  These activities must be completed for the expected surplus to be earned.</p>  <p>  NAMA was mandated in late 2009 to deal expeditiously with its acquired loan portfolio and to extract best value from that portfolio. NAMA has been extremely successful in achieving this mandate and has now entered into the final phase of this work. NAMA continues to de-risk its positions so that by 2020, the real estate and financial assets supported by NAMA funding will comprise a relatively small portfolio of liquid commercial and residential exposures. Active consideration is underway regarding NAMA&rsquo;s end of life strategy and the maximisation of the return of any surplus to the State in respect of these remaining assets. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, NAMA was established with a very specific legal mandate, which was approved by the European Commission in 2010. It is important that NAMA&rsquo;s role is preserved and that it completes its work in line with its original mandate.</p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full in 2020.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with EUROSTAT rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules. However, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

In addition to assessing the relevance, cost, value-for-money, and impact to date of the 9% VAT rate, the Review also looks at the estimated impact on the relevant sectors were the rate to be increased.  </p>  <p>  The Review found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes.  The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  Growth is also expected to continue in the medium term. This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the 9% rate sector remains strong.  The Review concludes that the VAT rating applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand or employment in the sector.  The Budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following this analysis.</p>  <p>  With regard to the expected increase in Exchequer revenues in 2019 as a result of the Budget change, this is estimated to be &euro;466 million.  The VAT rate increase in tourist accommodation is expected to yield &euro;235m in 2019, restaurants are expected to yield &euro;191m, hairdressing is estimated to yield &euro;27m in 2019, bloodstock sales is expected to yield &euro;7m and cinemas and shows are estimated to yield &euro;6m in 2019.</p></reply>

It is available to Irish and international film production companies that are resident in the State or in an EEA State and carry on business in the State through a branch or subsidiary. </p><p>In addition to extending the credit's end date from 2020 to 2024, Finance Bill 2018 provided for a short-term, tapered regional uplift, commencing at 5%, for productions being made in areas designated under the State aid regional guidelines. The regional uplift will be introduced subject to State aid approval.</p><p>The regional uplift will be phased out on a tiered basis with 5% available in years 1 and 2, 3% in year 3, 2% in year 4, and reducing to 0% from year 5 on.The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs and to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector.</p><p>In considering whether the regional film development uplift applies, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht shall have regard to the following factors - </p><p>i. whether the production of the film is substantially undertaken in an assisted region;</p><p>ii. whether there is limited availability of individuals with suitable experience or training who habitually reside within a 45 kilometre radius of the place of production to provide services, and</p><p>iii. in respect of the areas of expertise where there is limited availability, the company provides training for individuals that habitually reside within that 45 kilometre radius.</p><p>The regions availing of the uplift will currently be limited to areas in Ireland sanctioned to receive regional aid under the EU regional aid guidelines. </p><p>The EU Regional Aid Guidelines (RAGS) allow each Member State to provide enhanced rates of State aid in the least economically developed areas of each country. This enables the State&rsquo;s enterprise development agencies to grant State aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions.  </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s regional aid map was sanctioned by the EU in 2014. In accordance with the map, the regions unable to avail of the uplift are Dublin, Cork and the Mid-East generally, i.e. Kildare, Meath and Wicklow. (Exceptions in the mid-east which can receive regional aid assistance are Kells, Athy and Arklow.) The uplift is subject to State aid approval. My officials are currently in the process of notifying the aid with the European Commission. As I advised during Report stage of the Finance Bill process, should it transpire through conversations with the Commission that the geographic regions able to avail of the uplift can be amended, the inclusion of Cork city and county in may be something we can consider.</p><p>I would also like to advise the Deputy the process of notifying the EU of the regional uplift has begun but it is currently not possible to give a definitive timeline as to when this process will be completed.</p></reply>

For instance, to facilitate public investment, increases in capital expenditure are smoothed over a four-year period, where only one-quarter of the increase is taken into account in the first year.</p>  <p>  The rules also allow for deviations in the event of specific unforeseen circumstances &ndash; to date this has primarily been employed by several Member States in respect of costs relating to the refugee crisis &ndash; and to finance structural reforms that improve the long-term sustainability of the economy.</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that the provision of affordable housing is a top priority. The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan outlines the Government&rsquo;s strategy for tackling housing issues. According to the latest estimates, 63,727 housing solutions were delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, by the third quarter of 2018. In addition, last September, along with my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, I signed the Establishment order for the Land Development Agency. The Agency will work to better coordinate State lands for regeneration and development in partnership with land-owning State bodies.</p>  <p>  Finally, a wide range of housing measures were announced in Budget 2019, which provides a &euro;2.3 billion investment in housing this year. This represents a 25 per cent increase on 2018, and is the most the State has ever spent on housing. Budget 2019 provides a further increase of &euro;30 million for homelessness services, bringing the total allocation for 2019 to &euro;146 million.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank can interfere in the pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on the risks they are willing to accept.</p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that pricing in the insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, from a point where some premiums appeared to be priced at an unsustainably low level to the more recent experience of large increases, particularly in relation to motor insurance.</p>  <p>  Indeed, the problem of rising motor insurance premiums was the main impetus for the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, which the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., chairs.  Its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, set out within an Action Plan. The Working Group continued its work throughout 2017 and subsequently published the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018. </p>  <p>  Stakeholder consultation formed the foundation upon which the Working Group&rsquo;s two Reports and their recommendations were developed.  This consultation process undertaken by the Working Group involved a wide range of stakeholders representing the different voices within this sector, including representative bodies, the major individual motor insurance providers and interest groups.  The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all counties across the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers across the country during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland, including within a sub-group formed to implement relevant consumer-focused recommendations from the Motor Report. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy, has separately met with representatives from insurance companies and other relevant stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been discussed during these engagements.</p>  <p>  Quarterly progress updates on the implementation of the Reports have provided more detailed information on the implementation of each of the recommendations and actions.  The seventh quarterly update was published in November 2018 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.  Officials in my Department are currently working with the relevant stakeholders to prepare the update for the Fourth Quarter of 2018.   </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for November 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.7% since peaking in July 2016.  There was a drop of 7.6% year-on-year in November.</p>  <p>  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore there are many people who may still be seeing increases.  However, I am hopeful that this greater stability in pricing will be maintained with the result that premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 21 per cent.  </p>  <p>  The restoration of Irish competitiveness has been hard-won through improvements in productivity, wages and price moderation. It is important that this competitiveness is preserved and continues to facilitate sustainable economic growth.</p>  <p>  Importantly for Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, the robust growth in the economy has not yet given rise to inflationary pressure. For the first eleven months of the year, inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) averaged just 0.7 per cent on an annual basis, this follows five consecutive years in which inflation has been below 1 per cent. </p>  <p>  In the coming years, the domestic economy is expected to act as a primary driver of growth. In this context, we must remain cognisant of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, which could give rise to a loss of competitiveness.</p>  <p>  As highlighted in Budget 2019, our economy will also face a number of external risks in the years ahead. These risks primarily relate to a more adverse-than-expected outcome from Brexit, a rise in protectionism and a faster than expected normalisation of monetary policy.</p>  <p>  As a number of these factors are beyond our control the best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. That is what the Government has done and will continue to do going forward. </p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that the conditions under which the reimbursement to employees of the expenses of travel and subsistence may generally be made without deduction of tax are as follows: </p><p>(a)  firstly, the employee must be temporarily away from his/her normal place of work in the performance of the duties of his/her employment;</p><p>(b)  secondly, the travel expenses must be necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, and</p><p>(c)  thirdly, arising from a long-accepted position, supported by tax case law, the expenses of subsistence must attach to travelling necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment.</p><p>Moreover, provided the employee bears the cost of all expenses<b></b>of travel necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of his/her employment (and bears the cost of subsistence relating to such travel), Revenue will disregard for income tax purposes the reimbursement of expenses of travel and subsistence, where such reimbursement is made by way of: </p><p>(a)  a flat rate up to, but not exceeding, the prevailing Civil Service rates for travel and subsistence, or</p><p>(b)  a flat rate based on any other schedule of rates and related conditions of travel and subsistence, which do no more than reimburse the employee for actual expenditure necessarily incurred. </p><p>I do not consider that the conditions outlined above create unreasonable restrictions in the deductibility of travel expenses. Consequently, I do not see the need to consider an alternative approach. </p><p>As the Deputy has mentioned in his question, a public consultation was held in 2015 on the tax treatment of expenses of travel and subsistence for employees and office holders. Arising from that consultation a number of issues were identified, which resulted in the introduction of legislation in the Finance Acts of 2015 and 2016 to exempt certain expense payments of non-resident non-executive directors and members of the State Examinations Commission (2015), and of resident non-executive directors (2016).  I have no plans to introduce further legislation on this issue at present. </p><p>Finally, it should be noted that Revenue has published extensive guidance on the Tax Treatment of the Re-imbursement of Expenses of Travel and Subsistence to Office Holders and Employees, which is available on the Revenue website: Part 05-01-06; <i>.</i></p><p>Revenue are always willing to provide clarification to employees, businesses and tax practitioners in relation to all areas of taxation, including travel and subsistence expenses, if requested to do so.</p></reply>

Article 308 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that: &ldquo;The members of the European Investment Bank shall be the Member States&rdquo;. As a result, the UK will not remain a member of the EIB after it leaves the EU.</p>  <p>  Once the UK stops being a shareholder of the EIB, the capital it has provided to the EIB will no longer be part of the Bank&rsquo;s subscribed capital base.  In recent months, the shareholders of the EIB, including Ireland, have been actively discussing means by which the capital base of the EIB can be strengthened to compensate for the loss of the UK shareholding.  This may include, redenomination of some reserves and potentially an adjustment in the shareholdings of the EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Assuming a positive outcome and applying the provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement on the repayment of the UK&rsquo;s capital, the effect of UK withdrawal on EIB&rsquo;s operations and financial capacity should be mitigated.  This would include any direct impact on EIB lending to Ireland.  The future relationship between the UK and the EIB will be subject to the broader negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.</p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption. While there is no specific exemption from the requirement to pay LPT for persons as described in the deputy's questions, such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions. </p>  <p>  Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds. These deferral arrangements also take account of mortgage interest payments made by the property owner. </p>  <p>  The property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person and his or her gross income must be below certain thresholds. The thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple. Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.  </p>  <p>  Homeowners may also be able to claim a deferral on hardship grounds if they have suffered a significant unexpected and unavoidable financial loss or expense in the current year and as a result are unable to pay their LPT liabilities without causing excessive financial hardship.</p>  <p>  My department is currently finalising a review of the LPT in conjunction with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform, Housing Planning and Local Government, and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The review is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments. In that regard the review will be informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of those liable for the tax and provide clear direction on the likely payments faced by households in 2020. I will of course carefully consider the conclusions and recommendations of the report when it is presented to me.</p></reply>

However, what I can say is that in the Stability Programme Update in April 2014, debt service costs for 2018 were projected to be close to &euro;10 billion.  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) have advised me that the actual outturn for 2018 was under &euro;6 billion. Furthermore, debt service is now more than 20% below its 2014 peak.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why the debt service bill is so much lower than previously projected.  These include the European Central Bank's Quantitative Easing (QE) programme which has compressed sovereign bond yields, and the full early repayment of IMF Programme loans. </p><p>Looking back further towards the earlier part of the decade, the removal of margins on EU Programme loans and the replacement of the IBRC Promissory Notes have also helped reduce the debt service bill. </p><p>I am advised that the debt service bill is expected to fall further this year. </p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the pricing of insurance products, as this is a matter of a commercial nature, and determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p><p>I understand that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used, the claims record, and the number of drivers.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market.  In addition, insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience.</p><p>Regarding recent changes to legislation relating to learner drivers, my officials contacted their counterparts in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and were informed that it would be presumed that this would refer to two specific measures included in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018 which was commenced before Christmas.  The first is a provision to hold accountable owners of vehicles who allow unaccompanied learners to drive their vehicles.  The second extends the existing Garda power to detain vehicles in certain circumstances by adding the circumstance whereby the driver is an unaccompanied learner. </p><p>The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport emphasises that the new measures are intended to increase Garda enforcement powers in this area and act as a deterrent to the highly dangerous practice of learners driving unaccompanied and, as such, should make Irish roads safer.  However, it is unclear how these changes will impact upon the cost of motor insurance for learner drivers on a broad level, if at all, as since 2007 it has already been illegal for a learner to drive unaccompanied.  </p><p>More generally, the Deputy should note that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on putting into place the measures proposed in its <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>.  It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objective of delivering fairer premiums for all consumers, including learner drivers. </p><p>In this regard, it should be acknowledged that the most recent Central Statistics Office data (for November 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.7% since peaking in July 2016.  While the CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures represent a broad average and therefore it is appreciated that many people may still be seeing increases.  However, it is hoped that the improved stability in pricing will be maintained and that motor insurance premiums should continue to fall from the very high levels of mid-2016.</p></reply>

They provide additional benefits over and above normal pension entitlements, to or in respect of officers who, through no fault of their own, are killed or injured in the performance of their duties. The injury must be attributable to the nature of their duties.</p>  <p>  The additional benefits paid under the Injury Warrants consist, in the main, of an annual allowance or, in a limited set of circumstances, payment of a special gratuity.</p>  <p>  In non-fatal cases, once eligibility for an Injury Warrant annual allowance is established, the legislation prescribes that the amount of the award is determined by a classification as to the degree of impairment to the officer&rsquo;s earning capacity caused by the injury. The classifications in the legislation each have a corresponding proportion which is to be applied to the difference between (i) salary and emoluments at time of injury and (ii) other superannuation benefits. The result is the quantum of Injury Warrant annual allowance awarded. The total of the Injury Warrant award, when taken together with any other superannuation pension benefits, as well as any Social Welfare benefits in payment, is limited to 5/6ths of the officer&rsquo;s salary and emoluments at the date of injury. The Injury Warrant award is reduced, if necessary, to ensure this limit is not breached. </p>  <p>  There is no provision in the legislation for withdrawal of an award on the basis of a subsequent successful court action against the State for compensation in respect of the injury that formed the basis of the Injury Warrant award.</p>  <p>  However, I would point out that the Injury Warrant award, in addition to being a superannuation benefit, is also a form of compensation paid by the State. Thus, when considering a potential award for damages in a claim against the State, the amount of any Injury Warrant award already being paid by the State would be taken into account by the Court in assessing the level of compensation in the litigation.</p></reply>

Primary legislation was necessary to bring this decision into effect and the compulsory retirement age of 65 continued to apply until the enactment of the Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 on 26 December 2018.  Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached his/her compulsory retirement age before 26 December 2018 now has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.</p>  <p>  Prior to the enactment of the Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 on 26 December 2018, the compulsory retirement age of 65 continued to apply and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age were required to retire.  In recognition of the fact that there would be an unavoidable delay between the Government Decision to amend the compulsory retirement age and the enactment of the legislation necessary to bring that change into effect, I introduced temporary arrangements for those facing compulsory retirement in the interim.  These arrangements enabled public servants who reached the age of 65 to retire as required but to be rehired for 1 year until they reach the age of eligibility for the State pension (66).  Enactment of the legislation has no effect on those public servants who are availing of the interim arrangements. The terms of their fixed term contracts will continue to apply and they will cease working at age 66 as previously provided.  In the Civil Service, my understanding is that there are approximately 150 people who have availed of this arrangement.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the interim arrangements was to offer a limited, temporary solution to individuals who reached the age of 65 before the commencement of the necessary legislation.  It was clearly indicated that availing of the arrangements did not confer any rights to any new arrangement that might be provided for in future legislation and I understand that the arrangements were welcomed in that context.  If the interim arrangements had not existed, individuals in this position would have had to cease working at age 65.  Public servants who are currently availing of the interim arrangements have retired (at 65), received lump sums and are receiving pension (subject to abatement). They are thus in a very different position to public servants who had not yet reached the age of 65 before the enactment of the legislation. </p>  <p>  The necessity for people reaching the age of 65 to enter the interim arrangements ceased with effect from 26 December 2018.  Any relevant public servant reaching the age of 65 on or after that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70 and can choose to remain at work up to that age, on current terms and conditions.</p></reply>

Committee Stage commenced on the 6th of April 2017, where sections 1 to 42 of the 66 sections in the Bill were agreed.  Much work has been completed since the Bill was considered in Committee, including work specifically requested by the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach Committee (the Committee) and this work is outlined as follows.  </p><p>- <b>Letters to T.D.s, Senators and Local Authority Representative Organisations:</b></p><p>At the request of the Committee, I issued comprehensive letters and briefing regarding the Bill on 10th May 2017 to all TD's, Senators, and Local Government Representative Organisations. These letters detailed background information and key reforms of the Bill and included three attachments about the main provisions and checks and balances within the Bill, along with the table that you refer to in your question. For ease of reference I have attached a copy of this table.  Finally, the letters stated that my officials were available to discuss any issues that may arise. </p><p>-<b>Briefing for T.D.s and Senators:</b></p><p>At the Committee's request, a comprehensive briefing session on the Bill for all T.D.'s and Senators took place on 30th May 2017 in the Oireachtas.  </p><p>-<b>The Committee</b></p><p>On 16 August 2017 I wrote to the clerk of the Committee outlining that the requests made by the Committee had been met in full and seeking a resumption date for consideration of the Bill.  </p><p>- <b>Discussions with T.D.s</b>:</p><p>Minister of State O'Donovan is currently bringing the Bill forward on my behalf. In order to gain some cross-party consensus for the Bill, two meetings were held between the Minister of State, his officials and Deputy Dara Calleary T.D., Fianna F&aacute;il in November and December 2017, and a meeting was held between the Minister of State, his officials and Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, Sinn F&eacute;in in November 2017. These meetings discussed issues regarding various aspects of the Bill.  A substantive reply issued to Deputy Calleary in relation to his concerns in December 2017.  Deputy O'Brien's issues were addressed at the meeting and he advised that Sinn F&eacute;in was broadly in agreement with the Bill.  </p><p>- <b>Local Authority Representative Groups</b>: </p><p>The AILG and LAMA (Local Authority Representative Groups) were invited to the Committee in November 2017 to outline their issues in relation to the Bill. The clerk to the Committee then wrote to my Private Secretary enclosing the Official Transcript of the meeting and a letter from the AILG to me dated June 2017 (which was never received in my Department). The Committee asked my Department to review and address the issues that arose in the course of the hearing and to engage with the stakeholders in that regard. The Official Transcript was thoroughly reviewed by my officials to identify issues raised at the hearing. In January 2018, a meeting took place with the Local Authority Representative Groups to listen to their issues in relation to the Bill. In May 2018, officials also met with representatives from the CCMA (County and City Management Association).  </p><p>- <b>The Committee</b>: </p><p>A letter issued to the clerk of the Committee on 13 March 2018 outlining the response to each of the issues raised by the AILG and LAMA at the FPER Committee meeting in November 2017, and stated that given that all the requests of the Committee had been met, the Minister of State was seeking that the Committee re-commence and complete Committee Stage of the Bill as soon as possible. A reminder letter issued from the Minister of State in June 2018. A date of the 27th of September 2018 was provided for the re-commencement of Committee Stage, however, it had to be postponed due to a bereavement in the Minister of State's family. Committee Stage was subsequently re-scheduled for the 22nd of November 2018, however, this date was deferred by the Committee. My Department has since then, on a number of occasions, requested urgent re-scheduling of Committee Stage and is currently awaiting a date from the Committee. </p><p>- <b>Proposed Report Stage amendments</b></p><p>In order to address and resolve the various issues raised during the Committee session on 6 April 2017 and during the subsequent meetings with Oireachtas members and Local Authority Representative Groups, the Minister of State will be proposing a number of Report Stage amendments to the bill which have already been approved by Government.  These will be outlined at Committee Stage.</p><p>Finally, I would like to highlight that my Department has been working tirelessly on various items regarding the Bill, with a view to facilitating the speedy passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, once Committee Stage is re-commenced.</p><p><b><i>Table setting out the current declarations regime and the new proposed regime under the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 for Oireachtas Members and Members of Local Authorities</i></b><table><tr><th>Current Declarations Regime</th><th>Proposed Declarations Regime for category A and B under the Public Sector Standards Bill</th></tr><tr><td>Must declare <br /><br />- profession, trade, occupation etc (other than as a public official) where income exceeds &euro;2,600 at national level (no threshold at local level)<br /><br />- position as lobbyist, consultant or advisor (applies at national and local level)</td><td>Will continue to apply, but <br /><br />- source of income over &euro;2,600 will be declarable by category A and B; and amount of this income will be declarable for category A on private basis.

This original supplier conformed with a standard set by OPW, Eolas/NSAI in 1987, now updated to comply with EN14019. A second supplier entered the market in 2016 and has a cell window that also complies with EN14019, and in addition, has been tested by a third party.</p>  <p>  A due diligence review by a structural engineer firm confirmed that the cell windows &ldquo;which are currently being produced by both approved suppliers are fit for purpose&rdquo;. The report is commercially sensitive.</p>  <p>  Both window suppliers provided the data on the three elements that make up the cell window, namely, the glass block, concrete, and a protective laminate. The performance of the window relies upon the combined interaction of all three elements working together. It is this combined performance that makes a cell window comply with EN14019. Both approved cell window suppliers have individual elements (glass block, concrete, laminate) that vary when compared with each other. However, when the three elements are combined together they comply with EN14019. The selection of which approved cell window supplier, for a particular project, is the perogative of the main building contractor. The main contractor may choose a supplier based on the number of issues including cost of schedule of delivery, site installation program, etc.</p>  <p>  If any defects are noted by the contractor or the design team during the building inspections or later during the defects liability period post completion, they are brought to the attention of the relevant suppliers installation team for correction.</p>  <p>  The OPW have been undertaking a general detention area upgrade in Garda stations over the last number of years. The aim of this programme is to meet new standards of prisoner care including heating, ventilation, cell doors and ablution facilities. In some cases this upgrade leads to the renewal of old cell windows. It should be noted that many of the Garda stations involved in the detention area upgrade are of a considerable age dating back to the nineteenth century.</p></reply>

These awards were made in three panel domains - life sciences, physical sciences and engineering, and the arts, humanities and social sciences.</p>  <p>  In addition, there were 31 proposals designated by the international expert panels as fundable reserve proposals. These proposals meet the required standard of excellence and are ranked in order of merit. The reserve list applicants are distributed across the three panel domains and the two award types; effectively creating 6 rank lists.</p>  <p>  The reserve panels are activated if a) additional funding became available in respect of the Call or b) if one or more of the awardees was not in a position to take up or proceed with the award. If an awardee returns his/her award, a reserve list candidate of the same panel domain and award type is subsequently offered the award based on their ranking.</p>  <p>  Two Starting Grant Laureate awardees (Dr Larisa Florea and Dr Ted Vaughan) from the Physical Sciences and Engineering Panel were successful in winning Starting Grants from the European Research Council in July 2018. As it was not possible for these awardees to conduct research under both grants simultaneously, and as the European Research Council awards have substantially higher monetary value than the Laureates, the two researchers returned their Laureate awards.  Accordingly, two Starter Grant applicants from the Physical Sciences and Engineering Panel domain reserve list were selected for awards in order of ranking, namely Professor Laurence Gill and Dr Jonathan Mackey. </p>  <p>  In November-December 2018, two further Laureate awardees from the Physical Sciences and Engineering panel were successful in securing major research grants. Again, it is not possible for these awardees to hold both their new grants and the Laureate awards simultaneously, and are terminating their Laureate awards. The Council is currently examining funding two further awards from the reserve panel, in order of ranking.</p></reply>

The objective of the Scheme is to allow participating schools, following consultation with their local communities, to seek to achieve Gaeltacht School Recognition over the 5 year period of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022 on the basis of the implementation of specific language-based criteria, including the implementation of a total-immersion approach in Irish except for the teaching of the subject English and foreign languages and the development of action plans by schools to support implementation.</p>  <p>  Each participating school&rsquo;s action plans for improvement was reviewed by An tAonad um Oideachas Gaeltachta in February 2018 and feedback was provided to each individual school. This enabled each participating school, to access additional resources from September 2018. These resources include access to a grant to purchase Irish-medium teaching resources, additional language-teaching hours to support Irish, additional continuing professional development delivered by COGG, and additional advisory visits provided by the Inspectorate. </p>  <p>  The additional language support hours for Irish allocated to schools participating in the Scheme from September 2018, was based on the enrolment figures recorded in the previous year, which is in line with Department norms. Schools at primary level, were given the option to combine these additional language support hours with other primary schools in the locality to form clusters, which would allow for the creation of a temporary part-time teaching post that would be shared by the primary schools in the particular cluster.</p>  <p>  The current staffing schedule in primary schools operates at a general average of 1 teacher for every 26 pupils which is the most favourable position ever seen at primary level.

The process is the same for both primary and post primary and there is no application process.</p><p>The key data sources used in the renewed DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, single parent rate, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data was applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at </p><p>Following an initial application of this new methodology, 79 new schools were brought into the DEIS programme in 2017 with a further 30 being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  These schools were assessed as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage. </p><p>The schools in DEIS since 2006 were identified using different means.  At primary level there was a survey of school Principals using the following socio-economic variables: %unemployment; %local authority accommodation; %lone parenthood; %travellers; %large families (more than 5 children); %pupils eligible for free books. At post primary level a combination of data from the Departments pupil database including school level retention rates together with exam achievement data and exam fee waiver data, which indicated that students had medical cards was used.  </p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support. This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete.</p></reply>

I have spoken publicly of how vital it is that our young people can learn from the past so that they can plan for the future. I think it is very important that our education system should provide the opportunity to learn about, and learn from, key times and events in our history, events that we particularly recall in this decade of centenaries. These include the end of the First World War, the delicate path we walk to mark the foundation of the State, and the role of women in society.  The study of our history can also afford the opportunity to consider and learn from the story of Irish migration, of the journey from conflict to peace on this island, and to learn about the rich history of our Irish language and its place in our culture and our heritage.</p>  <p>  Prior to the implementation of the new Framework for Junior Cycle, only 52% of schools - the voluntary secondary schools - provided History as a core subject.  Yet 90% of students present for History in the Junior Certificate examination each year. </p>  <p>  It is against this backdrop, of the importance of learning from our past, that I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to review the optional nature of history under the new Framework for Junior Cycle. History was one of the new subject specifications introduced to schools just last September.</p>  <p>  As part of their review I have also asked the NCCA to identify how we can best promote the study of history in our schools. </p>  <p>  I have met with officials of the NCCA and had an initial discussion on this matter. I expect to receive a report from the Council by the end of the first quarter of this year.</p></reply>

The Education Act 1998 recognises the particular responsibility of the education system with regard to supporting the Irish language.   </p>  <p>  In recognising the linguistic, social and cultural importance of Irish and English in Ireland, both languages are included as core subjects in the national curricula for recognised primary and post-primary schools and centres for education in Ireland. The importance of the teaching of both languages in this way has been re-affirmed most recently in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030. </p>  <p>  Indeed, the most recent curricular changes at primary and junior cycle level have emphasised not only the importance of learning both languages but also the wider benefits of bilingualism. The development of these new language curricula reflects my Department&rsquo;s reassertion of its commitment to the Irish language and to progressing the language education related actions of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030. </p>  <p>  The new Primary Language Curriculum integrates English and Irish learning at primary level and supports teachers to work with children whose learning and development may progress at a different rate to their peers along a Progression Continuum.  Recent curricular developments create a very different learning environment for students, one which places them at the heart of the language learning and assessment processes from Junior Infants through to the end of Junior Cycle. The Primary Language Curriculum and the specifications for Irish in Junior Cycle place a strong emphasis on language skills development and the integration and transferability of those skills.  It also gives students potential to realise the benefits that could accrue from engaging in the study of two languages from an early age.  </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that in some very limited and well-defined circumstances as set out in Circular 12/96, an exemption from the study of Irish may be warranted.  To be eligible for an exemption a child&rsquo;s circumstances must satisfy the criteria of the circular and it is school management who are the delegated authority to grant exemptions in line with the criteria of the circular.  </p>  <p>  The Department is reviewing circulars on Irish exemptions from primary and post-primary schools and a public consultation is underway on proposed changes with a view to bringing the existing circulars up to date with current policy and in line with new language curricula.</p>  <p>  The public consultation, launched on 7 December, invites the public to complete a) a short on-line survey responding to the key proposed changes and b) to submit their views more generally on aspects of the proposed revised circulars.  A research report has also been published as part of the public consultation process.  The closing date for receipt of responses to the public consultation has been extended to the 18th January 2019.  The results of the public consultation will inform the new circulars under which exemptions from the study of Irish at primary and post-primary level will be permitted.</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,318 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). </p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  These restorations for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.</p></reply>

This announcement highlighted that the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review, and in particular would have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040, and also noted that there will be a be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future, which can be addressed through either planned capacity increases, additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department's review of provision at post-primary level across the school planning areas in the South Kildare area is now complete.  </p>  <p>  My Department is satisfied that the needs in the area can be met through the replacement and expansion of the existing Curragh Post-Primary School with a new 1,000 pupil school building. It is intended that the expansion of the existing Curragh post-Primary school, a multi-denominational Community College under the patronage of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB), will also cater for demand arising in the adjoining Newbridge and Kildare school planning areas.   </p>  <p>  Engagement is ongoing in relation to the potential for Educate Together to become a Trustee Partner for the school. A new site will be required for the school and my Department will be liaising with KWETB regarding the process for identifying a suitable site for the new school building.</p></reply>

My Department has not commissioned any reports in relation to the closure of English language schools. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department is taking steps to strengthen regulation of the English language sector. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018 is currently before the Seanad.  The new Bill provides for the establishment of the International Education Mark (IEM).  </p>  <p>  The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector and will provide a full quality framework for the provision of education to international learners in the future.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of QQI will be allowed to carry the Mark. </p>  <p>  Once fully implemented, providers will be able to apply to QQI to gain authorisation to use the IEM in order to be eligible to recruit international students. The IEM is a tool to further enhance and sustain the quality of our education system. It also provides learners, or potential learners, with the necessary confidence that providers with the IEM have been quality assured by QQI.  </p>  <p>  The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to examine a provider&rsquo;s financial sustainability.  These provisions will enable QQI to examine the bona fides of a provider in addition to assessing that the provider has the capacity and capability to implement the quality assurance processes and provide programmes of education and training consistent with the requirements of the Act. Providers will have to satisfy QQI in relation to issues such as the legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements in addition to examining that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses. </p>  <p>  Upon enactment, the Bill will also empower QQI to establish a Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL) Fund. This fund will be resourced by an annual charge from those providers covered by it. The fund will be used to &lsquo;teach out&rsquo; a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide a programme. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the appointment of a mediator to the English language education sector recently announced by my Department.   </p>  <p>  Mr Patrick King, the former General Secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland (ASTI), has been appointed to work with relevant stakeholders to explore the potential to address some of the employment related issues that have arisen in the English language education sector. Mr King will meet with employer and employee representative bodies early in 2019 to identify and discuss relevant issues. Mr King&rsquo;s role will be to explore whether there is scope for a set of minimum employment standards that could be agreed for the sector, and which could form the basis of a Registered Employment Agreement.</p>  <p>  This process will provide an opportunity for both employers and employees to address the employment related issues that continue to damage the reputation of the sector.  </p>  <p>  Interested parties are being encouraged to make a submission with their views on relevant issues that will assist the mediator in his work. A dedicated email address is now open to receive submissions: elemediation@education.gov.ie.</p></reply>

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post-primary level to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects, including Irish and Home Economics.</p>  <p>  In response to these difficulties, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established in March of last year. </p>  <p>  The Steering Group is considering the issues that impact on teacher supply, including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. The Steering Group is supported by a number of working groups which are looking in detail at the issues under these broad headings. In undertaking its task, the Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that In November 2018, I published the Action Plan for Teacher Supply setting out actions in the four policy areas. One of the higher education actions was for the HEA to engage with HEIs to ensure that additional 4-year undergraduate post primary initial teacher education (ITE) programmes are in place, including in priority subjects such as Irish and Home Economics.</p>  <p>  As a result of this engagement a number of new initial teacher education undergraduate programmes will now commence in 2019 and graduates will be eligible for registration with the Teaching Council in a number of the priority subject areas, including Home Economics and Irish. More new undergraduate ITE programmes are also planned by the HEIs to commence in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note also that one of the key actions in the Action Plan is the implementation of a campaign to promote the teaching profession. The first phase of the campaign, supported by a new dedicated website, was launched in December of last year and is designed, amongst other things, to encourage leaving certificate students, many of whom are in the process of making their CAO applications, to apply for an undergraduate ITE programmes, including the additional programmes put in place by the HEIs for 2019.</p></reply>

Consequently, the number of apprentices registered is determined by employers within each sector.  80% of the total time on a craft apprenticeship is spent on-the-job with the employer so demand for apprenticeship is primarily met by the employer base in any area.</p><p>Apprenticeships are national training programmes that are delivered via a range of education and training providers. Apprentices receive their off-the-job training in an Institute of Technology or an Education Training Board.  Technological University Dublin, Blanchardstown Campus, is one of the providers of off-the-job training and offers training for plumbing apprentices.  The numbers of apprentices at that location in recent years are set out in the following table.</p><p>It is not practical to offer the full range of apprenticeship trades in each training location.  SOLAS, in their role as co-ordinating provider, operates a transparent and equitable management system for the scheduling of all apprentices for their off-the-job training and whilst every effort is made to eliminate unnecessary travel apprentices sometimes have to attend training facilities outside their locality.  Apprentices in west Dublin also have access to the broad range of off-the-job training offered by City of Dublin ETB and Dublin Dun Laoghaire ETB Training Centres and at the campuses of Technological University Dublin.  </p><p>SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority will continue to monitor off-the-job training capacity as craft apprenticeship registrations continue to grow strongly.</p><p>Apprentices Attending Plumbing Phase 6 training in Blanchardstown Campus<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number </th></tr><tr><td>2016  </td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>63</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The wide range of opportunities offered through the apprenticeship programme should be an important part of this process.</p>  <p>  Government is working to address the visibility of apprenticeship and has put significant additional resources into this area.  A national promotional campaign, Generation Apprenticeship, has been underway since May 2017, led by the Apprenticeship Council and SOLAS.  The campaign promotes apprenticeship on TV and radio along with social media platforms that include Twitter; LinkedIn; Facebook and Instagram.  It has been designed to influence parents, teachers and potential apprentices on the career paths and further educational opportunities arising from apprenticeship programmes.  In addition, the Education &amp;amp; Training Board SOLAS Authorised Officers play a critical role in promoting apprenticeship by visiting employers, schools and attending career fairs. </p>  <p>  In addition, an independent review of career guidance, which is being carried out by Indecon International Consultants, is examining the quality and range of information and resources available to students in schools and other settings.  This will include an examination of how apprenticeship opportunities are presented to students in these settings. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, SOLAS has completed a review on pathways to participation in apprenticeship.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that our national apprenticeship system is more reflective of the range and diversity of our population, more inclusive of diverse backgrounds and abilities and that apprenticeship opportunities are more readily accessible to all. Work is already underway in many of the areas identified for action and SOLAS will lead implementation of the actions, working closely with apprenticeship partners and stakeholders, in particular employers, education and training providers and apprentices themselves.  The review is available on SOLAS&rsquo;s website www.solas.ie.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is also underway in SOLAS on a new employer portal initiative which will provide capability to approved employers to advertise apprenticeships, as well as other value-added services. The new portal is expected to be rolled out in 2019 on successful completion of a pilot phase.</p></reply>

My Department is strongly supportive of the promotion of wellbeing in our schools and has a key role to play in the promotion of the wellbeing of children and young people in Ireland, in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs, and with other Government Departments and Agencies.  </p><p>My Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health.  The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. </p><p>To support this holistic approach my Department has published a <i>Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice</i>(2018-2023) for all schools which will inform how schools can best promote student wellbeing.  The policy statement and framework for practice provides an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of Wellbeing Promotion in schools.  </p><p>Best practice indicates that schools adopt a whole-school, multi-component preventative approach to Wellbeing Promotion that includes both universal and targeted interventions.  A whole-school approach involves all in the school community engaging in a collaborative process to improve areas of school life that impact on wellbeing.  This will be achieved through the use of a School Self-Evaluation process taking Wellbeing Promotion as its focus.  It will allow schools to benchmark their practice against the statement of effective practice, and identify areas for development, implementation and review.It is envisaged that schools will engage with the statements and adapt and develop the best practice items as they meet the needs in their own school community.</p><p>A multi-component approach encourages schools to address areas, not only relating to Teaching and Learning but also relating to culture and environment, policy and planning and relationships and partnerships.  These areas are embedded in the Wellbeing Framework for Practice.  Working preventatively and providing for both universal and targeted approaches is described as providing a &lsquo;Continuum of Support&rsquo;.  Schools are encouraged to provide supports to promote the wellbeing of all within the school community as well as providing some targeted interventions for children and young people presenting with vulnerabilities in the area of wellbeing.  </p><p>It is my Department&rsquo;s aim that by 2023 all schools and centres for education will have embedded this dynamic School Self-evaluation process focusing on Wellbeing Promotion.  The implementation of this Wellbeing Promotion Process is an ongoing process that will ensure the necessary focus on supporting children and young people in having a sense of purpose and fulfilment, and the skills necessary to deal with life&rsquo;s challenges.</p><p>A Wellbeing Policy Implementation Plan, which has specified seven high level goals, has been agreed for achievement over the next five years.  </p><p>The seven high level goals are as follows:</p><p>1. Strengthen and align current structures within the Department and between the Department and other relevant Departments to ensure the coordinated implementation of this Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice.</p><p>2. Plan and provide for the national roll-out of a professional development process to facilitate all schools and centres for education to engage with and embed a Wellbeing Promotion Process which builds professional capacity and collaborative cultures from 2018-2023.</p><p>3. Provide for an aligned, comprehensive and easily-accessible programme of support for all schools and centres for education to address school-identified wellbeing promotion needs. </p><p>4. Consider how the system is meeting current and future teachers&rsquo; learning needs relating to wellbeing promotion </p><p>5. Develop a research based framework for the evaluation of wellbeing promotion in schools.</p><p>6. Improve use of supports for children and young people at key points of transition within and between education settings. </p><p>7. Promote the wellbeing of school and centre of education personnel.</p><p>Schools will be supported in this work by a national professional development programme currently being developed and trialled, and full roll out will commence in 2019.  In addition, our national support services will step up the investment made in building capacity within schools to deliver:</p><p>- More training for teachers and school staff (including the Incredible Years programme, the Friends programme and the SafeTALK programme)</p><p>- Improved curriculum content (through the Junior Cycle Wellbeing programme, improved resources for teachers to deliver Relationships and Sexuality Education)</p><p>- Best practice models of school based student support teams</p><p>- Protocols for connecting to wider support services</p><p>- A national training programme to support schools to implement the Self-Evaluation Wellbeing Promotion process and the development of Wellbeing Resources, including self-evaluation planning and feedback templates.</p><p>By providing this Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice I believe that we can fulfil our mission to enable individuals to achieve their full potential and contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s social cultural and economic development into the future. </p><p>I can also inform the Deputy that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment are engaged in a comprehensive review of senior cycle, a process informed by Junior Cycle reform. One component of this review will be examining ways to alleviate stress for our learners as part of the examinations system. As part of the first phase of the review the NCCA conducted international research on senior cycle in a number of other jurisdictions (France, Sweden, New Zealand, Queensland, Finland, England, Netherlands, and Ontario). The report of this research was published in February 2018 and is available on the NCCA&rsquo;s website.</p><p>A significant and exciting new step in the review started in autumn. The NCCA began collaborating with a group of 41 schools, which includes discussions with students, teachers and parents, to conduct a school-based review of senior cycle. Schools were provided with stimulus material to facilitate discussions with staff, students and parents. These school-based discussions will now widen out into national discussions, towards a final report to be agreed by the NCCA in mid-2019.</p><p>The revised Leaving Certificate grading system introduced in June 2017 was designed to reduce the pressure on students in chasing small percentage gains which would lead to changes in grade bands. This was done by reducing the number of overall grade bands.</p><p>In addition, the NCCA has been moving towards introducing second components to more leaving cert subjects. Some two-thirds of LC subjects now include a second assessment component which is undertaken by students before the June exams commence. The second assessment component also allows the assessment of a wider range of student skills than is possible with just a single written exam. </p><p>My Department and the State Examinations Commission also recently announced the addition of two days to the Leaving Certificate examination timetable. The additional days allow for new scheduling options for examinations, which are intended to minimise clashes for students and promote the wellbeing of students sitting exams.</p></reply>

The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.   This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs.  Under the new model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritised on their individual needs. </p>  <p>  NEPS understands dyslexia in the context the severity and persistence of an individual&rsquo;s needs over time and their response to intervention.  This approach aligns with the new Special Educational model in schools which focuses on the identification of need and the matching of specific interventions to that need.  Specific interventions are therefore tailored, by the school, to the individual&rsquo;s observed needs by the school, rather than being generic to a specific difficulty or disability. </p>  <p>  Therefore, in response to your specific query I can advise that, in the first instance, parents should discuss their concerns in relation to their child or young adult with the Principal involved and request a review of the child&rsquo;s current Student Support Plan with a view to discussing his/her response to interventions in place and the appropriateness of involvement of the NEPs psychologist. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available by county on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie  </p>  <p>  In Co. Meath, there are 3 special schools and 59 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Meath. Of these, 3 are Early Intervention classes, 35 are primary special classes and 16 are post primary special classes. </p>  <p>  The NCSE identifies the need for special class and special school placements nationally on an ongoing basis, and where specialised provision is required to support children with Special Educational Needs, it is planned and established to meet that need.  </p>  <p>  Schools may apply to the NCSE to open a special class where a need has been identified in their area, i.e. a number of students have professional reports indicating they require the support of a special class. </p>  <p>  SENOs may also approach a school directly where they are aware that a special class is or will be required in the near future. </p>  <p>  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.</p>  <p>  Where a school is not in a position to accommodate a special class within its existing accommodation, it is open to the school to submit an application to the Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation.</p>  <p>  In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs Base (SEN Base) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools.</p>  <p>  I have arranged for the Deputy's question on the location of special class provision in the Meath area to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the establishment of special provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act, which commenced on the 3rd of December 2018, provides the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

Within the schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary or caretaker, such staff are employees of individual schools.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently made significant efforts to improve the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using capitation grant assistance. In 2015 my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries on negotiations and agreed to enter an independent arbitration process on the issue. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p>  <p>  I am personally very much aware of this as an issue and the important role that School Secretaries and Caretakers play in the running of schools.  </p></reply>

This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available by county on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie  </p>  <p>  In Co. Kildare, there are currently 4 special schools and 75 special classes in mainstream schools, including 6 ASD Early Intervention classes, 46 primary ASD classes and 15 ASD post primary ASD classes.  </p>  <p>  While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand in Kildare. </p>  <p>  The NCSE identifies the need for special class and special school placements nationally on an ongoing basis, and where specialised provision is required to support children with Special Educational Needs, it is planned and established to meet that need.  </p>  <p>  I have arranged for the Deputy's question on emerging need in the Kildare area to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the establishment of special provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act, which commenced on the 3rd of December 2018, provides the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

This includes developing standards, policies and carrying out accreditation of pharmacy degree programmes.   The Minister for Health approved changes to the 5 year Masters in Pharmacy (MPharm) programme structure effective from September 2015 which supports the dispersal of placements throughout the five years (rather than focussed on the final year as was the case for students commencing study prior to 2015). </p>  <p>  Tuition fees are state-funded for the first four years of the pharmacy programme for students who satisfy the Free Fees criteria. A tuition fee will, however, have to be paid by all students for the final year (Masters) of the programme, as this is a postgraduate Level 9 award and funding is not available under the Free Fees Initiative for postgraduate study. </p>  <p>  SUSI grant support is available for those students who meet the qualifying criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression. Different supports are available to undergraduate and postgraduate students. Qualifying students attending integrated/intercalated courses, will be initially assessed in respect of the undergraduate portion of the course. A separate application will be required in respect of the portion of the course deemed to be the postgraduate element.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions who experience exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. In addition, tax relief is available on postgraduate tuition fees paid. Details in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Where shortfalls are identified, a teacher may seek the advice of the Teaching Council as to how the shortfalls should be addressed.    </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council considers applications from teachers who qualified outside Ireland, either in another EU/EEA member state or outside the EU/EEA, who are deemed fully qualified in the member state or home country.  Each application is assessed individually by the Council.</p>  <p>  EU/ EEA qualified teachers, in accordance with EU Directive 2005/36/EC, are entitled to have their qualifications recognised in all other member states. This recognition may be granted subject to conditions, including addressing any shortfalls. The Teaching Council is the competent authority in Ireland for assessing applications from people who qualified as teachers in other EU/EEA countries.</p>  <p>  Currently the assessment and registration process for teachers qualified outside of Ireland may take up to 12 weeks from receipt of all application documentation and depending on the time of year. However one of the actions in the Teacher Supply Action Plan, which I published in November 2018, is for the Teaching Council to develop a more streamlined process for the registration of teachers qualified in jurisdictions outside the State. A number of approaches are being considered by the Council to streamline the registration process and achieve this action.</p>  <p>  Further information on the registration requirement for teachers wishing to teach in Ireland are available on the teaching Council website at www.teachingcouncil.ie.</p></reply>

In order to build a political consensus regarding a future approach to funding the higher Education Sector the then Minister for Education and Skills referred the expert group report on future funding of higher education to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for their consideration.  The Committee requested that the Department undertake an economic examination of the three policy options proposed by the expert group to assist the Committee in forming its view of the most appropriate option. </p>  <p>  In Q4 2018, my Department applied to the European Commission Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP) which provides tailor-made support to all EU countries for their institutional, administrative and growth-enhancing reforms to carry out the analysis of the three policy options identified by the Expert Group.  Formal decision-making by the European Commission on projects that have been successful in obtaining supporting is expected by end-February 2019.</p>  <p>  Having this evaluation undertaken through the Commission&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme will provide the type of international expertise, analysis, and objectivity that would be beneficial to a major evaluation of this nature.</p>  <p>  Policy decisions in relation to the Student Grant Scheme will be considered in the wider context of the Cassells Report, however, the statutory based Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations continue to be reviewed annually by my Department, following consultation with various stakeholders. Changes to the Student Support Act 2011 are also proposed under the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Contingency Action Plan; to ensure that eligible students attending colleges in the UK and eligible UK nationals studying here, continue to receive grant support. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations for the 2019/20 academic year will be published in early April 2019. Students attending college in the academic year 2019/20 will be required to submit their grant application to SUSI (via www.susi.ie) to have their eligibility for grant assistance assessed. </p>  <p>  Third-level students who are experiencing exceptional financial need, can also apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

An additional per capita grant is paid to schools in the voluntary secondary sector in which instruction is through the medium of Irish in full or in part. However, this is not the method of funding that applies to the Community and Comprehensive or the ETB sectors. In the case of the Community and Comprehensive Sector the Department provides funding on a budget basis that is based mainly on pupil numbers, but also takes into account additional factors which vary from school to school such as condition of buildings, size of school etc.</p>  <p>  The ETB allocations are made on a budget basis in respect of head office and other costs, including those relating to schools. ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets and each ETB is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. Any funding issues for an individual school have to be managed from within the relevant ETB&rsquo;s budget.  The Department does not earmark funding allocations for individual schools in the ETB sector. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy is aware of the further improvements announced in the 2019 Budget which will see increased capitation funding for the school sector for the 2019/20 school year and in the non-pay budgets in the ETB sector.</p></reply>

It is accepted that good connectivity is essential to ensure that schools are facilitated to progress the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning and for the implementation of new and revised curriculum. </p>  <p>  All post-primary schools and some special schools are now on high speed broadband through the Department's High Speed Broadband Programme, managed by HEAnet.</p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision. </p>  <p>  The policy of my Department through the Schools Broadband Access Programme is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and within financial constraints. Currently investment of some &euro;15m is allocated annually for the provision of internet connectivity to schools. As the deputy is no doubt aware broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on local infrastructure which can impact on the service that can be provided in individual schools. </p>  <p>  The Department reviews the availability and quality of services and upgrades schools under the programme when the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. Currently, over 1,400 primary schools have been awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). This represents more than one third of all primary schools which is a significant improvement in recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012. Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2018, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment and industry provision.</p></reply>

Irish Travellers are identified as a target group within the Plan.</p><p>To support the implementation of the National Access Plan (NAP), the Department of Education and Skills (DES) established the <i>Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) </i>fund in 2016.  Through PATH the Government committed more than &euro;16 million over three years to increase access to higher education by the target groups identified in the NAP and will see many new initiatives emerge that will support greater levels of access and participation.</p><p>I recently published a Progress Review of the NAP in which it has been recommended that the terms of the National Access Plan be extended by two years to 2021. This is necessary to allow for the implementation of the Access Data Plan and to ensure that the targets for the new National Access Plan are set based on the new data. Sufficient time needs to be provided for baseline data to be collected and verified. An extension of the term would also enable initiative such as PATH to be more fully implemented and evaluated, and allow learning outcomes to be used to inform the next National Access Plan.</p><p>The Department also provides a suite of supports costing in the region of &euro;400 million that are intended to assist students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and other under-represented groups, to overcome financial barriers to accessing and completing Further and Higher Education. These supports include the student grants, the fund for students with disabilities, the student assistant fund and a number of bursary schemes.</p><p>The annual core grant allocation by the HEA to each higher education institution includes an access funding element which is based on the number of students from access target groups who are participating in each institution as derived from the return of annual student data by each institution to the HEA.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on the 18th  July 2018, is an important piece of legislation which will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils.</p></reply>

This involved 30 schools constructed by Western Building Systems under Design and Build contracts and a representative sample of 25 other schools constructed over the last 20 years. A number of schools in the Fingal area were included in this assessment process.  Fire Safety Consultants have visited all 55 schools and Fire Safety Assessment reports have been received in my Department. </p>  <p>  The Fire Safety Consultants have engaged directly with the fire officers in their respective local authorities to advise of remedial works planned and underway. The fire officers have broadly welcomed the Department&rsquo;s proactive approach to dealing with the issues highlighted and have indicated their acceptance of the course of action being followed, including the identified remediation works and the fact that the schools continue to be occupied on a day-to-day basis.</p>  <p>  The assessments are intended to give a clear picture of whether there may be issues arising out of compliance with fire safety certificates in school buildings. The assessments focus on the conformance of the school building with relevant fire safety obligations, and where deemed necessary, on recommendations for remedial actions in order to satisfy those obligations.   The reports identify various housekeeping, maintenance and remedial works to be addressed and the Department has engaged the services of KSN Project Managers with a full technical team including Architects, Engineers and Fire Safety Consultants, to organise and oversee any necessary remedial works. My Department has no reason to believe that there are issues with fire safety provisions in schools generally, including in the Fingal area. These additional steps are an added precaution being taken by my Department prompted by recent concerns in Ireland and abroad regarding fire safety in public buildings.</p></reply>

In fact, as part of Budget 2019, the Government announced the introduction of a new paid parental leave scheme, which will commence later this year.  This new scheme will initially provide two weeks of paid, non-transferable leave per parent, with a view to expanding the scheme and increasing the number of weeks of paid leave for both parents in future years. </p>  <p>  During the debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2017, I strongly suggested that the relevant Oireachtas Committee would carry out detailed pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill. If this had occurred, it would have allowed all stakeholders to scrutinise the proposed legislation and to report on any policy or legal issues which may have be identified. It is my view that this is what should happen with all such legislation. Unfortunately, this scrutiny did not take place and it has now arisen that a number of Government Departments have raised certain issues which need to be clarified.</p>  <p>   Subsequently, it has been brought to my attention that the Bill&rsquo;s sponsors have decided not to proceed with the Committee Stage in the Seanad at this time.</p></reply>

The most common reason for this is that many respondents in wardship applications are persons over 70 years of age. An application can take some months to complete and it often happens that the respondent passes away between the date of the application but prior to a declaration order being made.  The Courts Service has informed me that objections to applications for wardship are not common and have only arisen in adult wardship cases. However, the Courts Service does not maintain statistics on the number of objections lodged, although it is estimated that approximately 10 such objections were lodged in 2018. The Courts Service has further advised that any such objections must be grounded on medical evidence.</p><p>In terms of persons under the age of 18, the Courts Service has informed me that it does not maintain statistics on the number of minor wardship applications but has confirmed that all such applications are dealt with promptly and without delay.

In 2018 the average daily population figure was 288.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that prison Governors are required by law to accept all prisoners into their custody who have been committed to prison by the Courts.  The Irish Prison Service therefore has no control over the numbers committed to custody at any given time.</p><p>The actual number of beds available on a given day can be less than the capacity figure as cells may be unavailable for different reasons such as repairs and maintenance. Furthermore, where local management assess a prisoner as being unsuited to share a cell for reasons of vulnerability or propensity to violence, a cell designated as being operationally suitable for two prisoners may, temporarily, house only one prisoner.</p><p>Where the number of prisoners exceeds the maximum capacity in any prison, my officials make every effort to deal with this through a combination of inter-prison transfers and structured Temporary Release.</p><p>Decisions in relation to temporary release are considered on a case by case basis and the safety of the public is paramount when those decisions are made.</p><p>The numbers of prisoners accommodated in Cork prison on a monthly basis for 2018<table><tr><th>Month</th><th>Average Daily Number of

The law and procedures governing the execution of Court Orders are contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts and the Rules of Court made thereunder and any dispute in relation to the enforcement of a Court Order is a matter for the Courts.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, the persons in attendance at recent repossessions at North Frederick Street and more recently in Roscommon  were not subject to regulation by the Private Security Authority (PSA). However, following these incidents, I convened a Working Group chaired by a senior official from my Department to examine the administrative, legislative, resources, security and any other matters necessary with a view to bringing the regulation and licensing of security personnel assisting those enforcing court orders within the remit of the PSA.

Part IIA of that Act, comprising sections 19A to 19H, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides for offences in relation to illegal trespass and occupation of land which result in a range of specified adverse consequences.  Such land includes privately owned land and public land provided or maintained by a statutory body.  The legislation empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to direct trespassers to leave the land concerned and, if necessary, remove any object belonging to them from the occupied land.  A person who is guilty of an offence under this Part of the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;4,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to one month, or both.</p>  <p>  The Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act 1971 also contains provisions relating to trespass.  Under this Act it is an offence to forcibly enter land, including buildings, or remain in forcible occupation, or to encourage or advocate the commission of such an offence.  The word "forcibly" is defined as using or threatening to use force in relation to persons or property, and such action is not necessarily linked to any other crime.  A person guilty of a first offence under the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both.  A second or subsequent offence under the Act is punishable, on summary conviction, by a fine of up to &euro;1,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months, or both.  Conviction on indictment for an offence under the Act can result in a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or a prison term of up to 3 years, or both.</p>  <p>  These are significant legislative provisions and penalties in relation to trespass; however, the law is kept under review.  The provisions relating to trespass and occupation of land that were inserted into the 1994 Act were brought forward by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and no doubt my colleague the current Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will also keep these matters under review.</p></reply>

Consequently, the Government has demonstrated this commitment by providing significant additional resources, in terms of funding and staff resources, to the Data Protection Commission (DPC) in recent years. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, the DPC was allocated &euro;15.2 million which is an increase of more than 30% over its allocation in 2018. The 2019 budget allocation is approximately eight times the &euro;1.9 million allocated to the then Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in 2014 and a doubling of the DPC's 2017 allocation. This very significant increase in budgetary provision demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to meeting the funding requirements of the Irish data protection authority.</p>  <p>  The DPC will have approximately 130 staff by the end of January 2019. It is envisaged that its staff numbers will grow to circa 170 by the end of 2019; this is in line with the budgetary submission that the DPC made to my Department in late 2018 which my officials then considered in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to keeping the resourcing of the DPC under on-going review. My Department will continue to monitor the impact of implementation of the GPDR, the impact of any possible future regulatory changes as well as any changes within industry, in conjunction with the DPC, to ensure that the DPC continues to have the resources required to fulfil its important, statutory objectives.</p></reply>

It provides comprehensive protections for workers in both the public and private sectors against penalisation by their employers in circumstances where they have raised concerns about potential wrongdoing.  A protected disclosure, in the 2014 Act, is a disclosure of information which, in the reasonable belief of the worker, tends to show one or more relevant wrongdoings; came to the attention of the worker in connection with the worker&rsquo;s employment; and is disclosed in the manner prescribed in the Act.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a discloser need not refer to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 in making a protected disclosure. Furthermore, some correspondence which purports to be a protected disclosure does not fall under the terms of the 2014 Act as described above.

Part III is only in force where a resolution has been passed by the relevant local authority to permit gaming machines.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Slot machines&rsquo; are not defined in Irish law.  However, &lsquo;gaming machines&rsquo; are defined in the Finance Act 1975 and &lsquo;amusement machines&rsquo; are defined in the Finance Act 1992.  A gaming machine allows a player to win a monetary prize, of any amount, or a non &ndash; monetary prize in excess of &euro;7 in value.  An amusement machine allows a player to win no more than an opportunity to play the machine again or to obtain a non-monetary prize up to &euro;7 in value.</p>  <p>  An operator of gaming machines must first apply to the District Court for a certificate for a gaming licence.  This is required for each premises where it is intended to make gaming machines available for play.  Provided the District Court grants this certificate, the operator must then apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a Gaming Licence for each premises concerned.  The Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 provides that Revenue shall, on the application of a person who has been granted a certificate for a gaming licence by the District Court and on payment of the relevant excise duty, issue to that person a Gaming Licence.  </p>  <p>  An operator of gaming machines must also apply to Revenue for a Gaming Machine Licence in respect of each gaming machine made available for play.  Gaming Machine Licences may only be issued by Revenue Commissioners to an operator who already holds a Gaming Licence (for premises) and who has paid the relevant excise duty.  </p>  <p>  An operator of amusement machines must apply to the Revenue Commissioners for an Amusement Machine Permit and pay the relevant excise duty.  An application for an Amusement Machine Permit must include a schedule of the public places in the State where amusement machines are to be made available for play.  Operators of amusement machines must also apply to Revenue for an Amusement Machine Licence for each amusement machine made available for play and pay the relevant excise duty. </p>  <p>  While licensing of these machines is not the direct responsibility of my Department, to assist the Deputy, I have had enquiries made of the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are 2 premises in Dublin that either currently have a Gaming Licence (and are licensed to make gaming machines available for play) or were so licensed up to a recent date. </p>  <p>  I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a complete figure for the number of premises in Dublin specifically that are licensed for the operation of amusement machines is not readily available, as permits may be issued to an operator for any premises in Dublin or in other locations where amusement machines are made available.</p>  <p>  I am again advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are currently undertaking a national compliance project in relation to gaming and amusement machines.  Questions with regard to this matter should be referred to my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will see from the above, the legislation in this area is complex, therefore I hope to publish the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill early in the current Oireachtas session.  This will be an interim reform measure, pending the bringing forward of comprehensive gambling control legislation. </p>  <p>  The amendments proposed under the Bill address certain deficiencies with regard to the conduct of activities regulated under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, and provide for the modernisation of that Act by way of, among other matters, arrangements for the better promotion of lotteries, updating certain stake and prize limits and standardising the minimum gambling age at 18.   </p>  <p>  As regards wider reform of gambling licensing and regulation, the Working Group on Gambling is currently finalising its Report to Government.  This Group was established to review the provisions of the 2013 General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill and other relevant developments since.  These included matters relating to the future approach to be taken to the licensing of gaming machines. </p>  <p>  I hope to bring this Report to Government for approval as soon as possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-15a.1074.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019011500078#WRV01900"><p>The establishment in Ireland of an agency comparable to the child maintenance services in other states would require substantial changes to the legal framework for determining issues relating to child maintenance.  The requirement of Article 34 of the Constitution that justice be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by the Constitution is a matter that would have to be carefully considered.  </p>  <p>  Parents are not automatically required to seek recourse through the courts to obtain child maintenance.  It is open to parents whose relationship has broken down to decide between themselves on maintenance arrangements for their children.  If they experience difficulties in reaching agreement on maintenance arrangements, they can try to work out a maintenance agreement through mediation.  The general objective of the Mediation Act 2017, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, is to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings, including proceedings relating to maintenance of children, thereby reducing legal costs, speeding up the resolution of disputes and relieving the stress involved in court proceedings. </p>  <p>  Parents may seek a determination from the courts in cases where there are issues arising from disagreements about the provision of maintenance for dependent children, or failure by persons with maintenance responsibilities for children to provide proper maintenance.  Relevant legislation in this area includes section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, section 8 of the Family Law Act 1995, section 13 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 and section 45 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provided for a number of improvements in the law relating to maintenance of children.</p>  <p>  The law as it stands provides several mechanisms, including possible penalties, where a person fails to comply with court-ordered maintenance obligations.  Section 10 of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 enables a maintenance creditor to apply to the court for an order that maintenance be paid by way of attachment of earnings, so the maintenance due is deducted directly from income.  A person can apply for an attachment of earnings order when applying to court for a maintenance order, if he or she is concerned that maintenance will not be paid, or he or she can apply later if the maintenance is not paid. </p>  <p>  The maintenance creditor may seek to recover sums owing through the courts by utilising the enforcement mechanisms available under section 8 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 (as substituted by section 63 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011).  In addition, where the failure to pay maintenance is as a result of unwillingness, as distinct from inability, to pay, under section 9A of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, the District Court has the power to regard a failure by a parent to comply with a court order relating to maintenance as contempt of court and to deal with it accordingly, including by means of imprisonment.  </p>  <p>  While I have no plans at present for the establishment of a statutory child maintenance service, the Deputy will be no doubt aware that First 5 - A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2019-2028, which was published in November 2018, includes a commitment that the Department of Justice and Equality will commence and progress a review of the effectiveness and accessibility of arrangements for recovery of maintenance payments by non-resident parents, including an examination of arrangements in other jurisdictions to ascertain the possibilities for making the maintenance recovery process easier for parents, improving the outcomes for children and reducing as far as possible the need for court proceedings for maintenance recovery.  This review, which is set out under Strategic Action 3.1, is to be commenced within two years of the publication of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to significant reform of the courts, including the establishment of a family law court structure that is streamlined, more efficient, and less costly.  My Department is working on a General Scheme of a Family Court Bill which will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help ensure that the Family Court will operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner.  The intention is to establish a dedicated Family Court within the existing court structures.  The Family Court Bill will support the proposals in the Mediation Act 2017 by encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in more timely resolution of family law cases.</p></reply>

The programme is based on agreed Garda priorities in relation to their accommodation needs nationwide and involves over &euro;60 million exchequer funding spread across both the OPW and Garda Votes as well as a major PPP.  This investment is intended to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them.</p>  <p>  The programme includes planned works at over 30 locations, including:</p>  <p>  - major refurbishment of selected stations and facilities, including facilities for meeting victims of crime;</p>  <p>  - essential remedial works to selected existing stations; and</p>  <p>  - development of large scale Property and Exhibit Management Stores (PEMS).</p>  <p>  The programme also includes a Cell Refurbishment Programme and provision of improved Custody Management Facilities.</p>  <p>  Good progress is being made in implementation of the programme.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort model of resource allocation is currently utilised for the allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College.  The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel using the Cohort Model is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, and operational strategies.  When considering the allocation of resources to a Division, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management during which all factors are taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to keep in mind that they have a further 16 months of practical and classroom-based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that while not all Garda Stations are training stations it is important to note that the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p></reply>

A dynamic distribution model of resource allocation, known as the Cohort model, has been in use by Garda management since 2015 for the allocation of personnel, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College.  The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel using the Cohort Model is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements and operational strategies.  When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with Local Management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that it is not possible to provide the information requested for the number of Garda&iacute; that have transferred without replacement out of the Divisions in question.  Whilst there is a policy not to transfer a Garda from a Division without provision of a replacement, in order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management has the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs taking account of the Cohort model of resource allocation.</p></reply>

While the status of the GSOC investigation remains unchanged I can offer Deputies some update into the investigation of issues related to this tragic case.</p>  <p>  The outcome of GSOC&rsquo;s criminal investigation was set out in an interim report issued last year, which was provided to the family of the late Shane O'Farrell.  The investigation concluded that no criminal misbehaviour by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was disclosed.  GSOC&rsquo;s investigation found that, while no such conduct occurred which would require criminal sanction, certain aspects were identified as requiring further investigation which may lead to disciplinary proceedings against one or more members.  The investigation of those matters by GSOC is still on-going.  In the circumstances I do not propose to comment further while the investigation is proceeding.  I know that it can be frustrating that investigations are not completed as quickly as people would like.  However, our overriding concern must be that investigations are comprehensive and conducted to the highest standards. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am acutely conscious of my responsibility  - and that of all Members of the House &ndash; to respect the independence of the Ombudsman Commission and guard against improper interference with its investigations. </p>  <p>  With regard to the motion passed by this House last June, it referred to the need to examine the actions of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions, GSOC and the Courts.  The terms of the motion largely reflect the calls by the family of the late Shane O'Farrell for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the road traffic incident in which he tragically lost his life.  I would remind the House of the constitutional independence of the Courts and the statutory independence of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions and GSOC.  These are important matters which must be taken into consideration if there is to be a further examination or investigation of issues related to this tragic case.</p>  <p>  I have, as I said previously in the House, been considering the terms of the motion and what options might be available to me in response to it and, in this regard, I am engaging with the Attorney General to determine how I may proceed in relation to the terms of the motion. </p>  <p>  I am awaiting the Attorney's advice and when I receive it I will be better placed to decide how to proceed.</p></reply>

Following the publication of the report, work commenced on a General Scheme of a Bill on the establishment of a Parole Board on a statutory basis.</p>  <p>  In April 2017, the Government agreed to focus on the Private Members Parole Bill 2016 that had been brought forward by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan and to work in partnership with Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan to achieve this objective. It was also agreed that appropriate amendments to the Bill would be brought forward in consultation with Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan. The Bill passed Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 24 April 2017.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for establishing a Parole Board on a statutory basis to determine releases from prison of long sentence offenders. It sets out the criteria to be considered in deciding on the release of prisoners, which include risk to public safety and the extent to which release will facilitate the prisoner&rsquo;s reintegration into society. </p>  <p>  Substantial amendments to the Bill were developed in conjunction with Deputy O'Callaghan and, on 8 May 2018, the Government approved the drafting of these amendments by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. That drafting work is underway and my officials will continue to engage with Deputy O'Callaghan throughout this process.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, processing times are on a par with, and in many cases, better than last year.</p><p>The business target for processing 'short-stay C' visas is within eight weeks (current processing time in Dublin for most categories is within two weeks).  However, the processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.  </p><p>In relation to applications under the Free Movement Directive (2004/38/EC), there had been an exponential increase from the second quarter of 2015 in the number of such applications.  That gave rise to a caseload of around 10,500 applications which had to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive were detected and dealt with appropriately. Considerable progress has been made in that regard with the majority of these applications now processed. </p><p>The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p></reply>

Where appropriate, a multi-entry visa can be granted for persons regularly coming to the State for business purposes. For persons seeking to conduct business in the State for a period in excess of 14 days, and have met certain criteria, there are specific options available, including a permission under the Atypical Work Scheme operated by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) or for an Employment Permit through the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the British Irish Visa Scheme (BIVS), underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding drawn up between my Department and the UK Home Office, also applies to business travellers on a short stay visit.  The BIVS visa allows a short-stay visitor to visit both Ireland and the UK (and the North and South of the Island) without the need for two separate visas. While a BIVS visa is only currently  available to national residents of India and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, it is intended to extend its availability to other countries on a phased basis following discussions with the UK authorities.</p>  <p>  The BIVS builds on the success of Ireland's Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme which was first introduced in 2011, and extended in October 2016 for a further five years to 31 October, 2021.</p>  <p>  The Programme enables nationals of 17 countries to travel to Ireland for a short stay using a valid UK visit visa.  The countries covered under the programme are: Bahrain, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, India, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Montenegro, Oman, People's Republic of China, Qatar, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.</p>  <p>  At present, there are no plans to introduce further changes to the  visa regime for persons travelling to the State for business purposes which is designed to be as flexible as possible to meet requirements.</p></reply>

I understand that these additional personnel are sourced, contracted and paid for by the bank or lending institution and the Sheriff then appoints them as bailiffs.

As the Deputy will appreciate, not all protected disclosures involve allegations of corruption.  It is not necessary for a person to cite the 2014 Act in order for correspondence to be a protected disclosure.  An organisation in receipt of correspondence makes an assessment under the 2014 Act to determine if it should be treated as a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  The Act allows members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make a protected disclosure to one or more of a number of persons, including to the Minister of the day.  Since 2014, my Department has received 24 letters from current or former members or employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to matters which might be regarded as a protected disclosure.  The Deputy will be aware that in 2016 my predecessor referred two of these disclosures for assessment by a retired High Court Judge and this resulted in the Government setting up the Disclosures Tribunal.</p>  <p>  I have, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General, established a panel of counsel to assess disclosures made to me by members or former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The panel is to provide  independent advice to my Department on how each case should be treated and the panel has recently commenced this work.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure an independent assessment of these matters, counsel have been instructed to assess all relevant documentation relating to the allegations, without prejudice, and  to make whatever recommendations they see fit.  </p>  <p>  There is no timeframe specified in the Act for the assessment of protected disclosures.  The Deputy will appreciate that, by their very nature, this correspondence may involve varying degrees of complexity and careful consideration of each is of the utmost importance.  However, I am anxious that there will be no unnecessary delays in carrying out the assessment and following through on any recommended actions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the preservation of anonymity is paramount to ensuring the process is maintained in such a manner that those who wish to bring forward concerns may do so in good faith and without any fear of retribution.  As has been advised to those whose cases have been referred to the panel, this process is not intended to act as an investigative tool but rather a mechanism whereby my Department can receive independent advice regarding the most appropriate manner in which to deal with the concerns outlined.  On this basis, the question of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na participating in this process does not arise.  My officials have, however, sought the permission of the person who made the disclosure to refer it to the panel.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that this panel is not intended to interfere in any way with the work of the Disclosures Tribunal.  </p></reply>

A further 5 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered.

In total in the period 2013 - 2017, almost &euro;44 million has been invested in the fleet with some 2,000 vehicles coming on stream to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.</p><p>Decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles across the various Garda divisions are a matter for the Commissioner in light of his identified operational demands and the availability of resources.

My Department aims to provide its customers with a complaints procedure that is accessible, efficient, effective, standardised and fair.  The Customer Service Charter and our Customer Service Action Plan 2016 &ndash; 2018 set out the commitments and standards of service that customers can expect in their dealing with the Department.  A new Customer Service Charter and Customer Service Action Plan for 2019 &ndash; 2021 is currently being finalised.</p><p>The Department defines a customer service complaint as an expression of dissatisfaction concerning the provision of a service or services.  This does not cover requests for reviews or appeals against decisions taken in the operation of a scheme or service.  </p><p>If a customer is not happy with the standard of service received, they are advised to contact the Division of the Department that they were dealing with to have the matter resolved in the first instance.  If this does not resolve the issue customers may contact the Department&rsquo;s Customer Service Officer directly who will investigate the complaint.  If the complaint is concerning the standard of service provided by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), customers are advised to contact the Quality Customer Service Officer for that area.</p><p>In the event that a customer is not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation, he/she has the right to pursue the matter further with the Office of the Ombudsman.  In some circumstances people contact the Ombudsman directly with their complaint, who if deemed appropriate may then refer the matter back to my Department. It should be noted that in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of the Ombudsman Act, 1980 the remit of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office does not extend to naturalisation or immigration matters. However, INIS do engage with the Ombudsman&rsquo;s&rsquo; Office on matters raised with that Office.</p><p>Figures shown in the table below reflect the number of complaints received by the Customer Service Officer since 2016.  This does not include any complaints that have been resolved by a Division directly . The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) have provided figures in relation to complaints received by email to the INIS customer service mailbox.  </p><p>This Department does not categorise complaints or record the other information sought by the Deputy, but this matter will be reviewed in the context of the forthcoming Customer Service Action Plan.  Once the Customer Service Officer has investigated a complaint and the customer has been advised of the outcome the matter is recorded as closed.<table><tr><th>Complaints received by the Customer Service Officer</th><th>2016 </th><th>2017 </th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>Complaints received by email to INIS Customer Services</th><th>2016 </th><th>2017 </th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>29</td><td>170</td><td>298</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This budgetary increase will allow the Agency to begin a second phase of the RPP this year, which will see work begin on new buildings in Carlow, Athlone, Dundalk and Monaghan.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the RPP remains an important tool through which we can help encourage further investment from overseas firms into regional Ireland. As the IDA's record 2018 results demonstrated, significant progress has already been made in terms of generating new FDI-driven employment opportunities outside of Dublin. 58% of all IDA client-supported employment, in fact, is now located outside the capital. I am confident that the next phase of the RPP will help us increase, in due course, that percentage even further.  </p></reply>

The main tenant on the park at present is ATA Group, an Enterprise Ireland (EI) client. IDA Ireland has completed a sale, in the past number of months, of other land at the park to a separate EI client company. It is hoped that this recent investment will generate new employment opportunities for the area. The IDA will continue as well to seek new investment for the Park and the wider region from overseas firms.</p>  <p>  With respect to Cavan more generally, IDA Ireland markets the County as part of its North-East region, together with Louth and Monaghan. The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the area and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre.  As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area the Agency is focusing on sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The IDA also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan including local authorities, the education sector and both overseas and indigenous companies with a view to generating new employment opportunities. </p></reply>

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on Friday 30 November last, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI). ITI works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.</p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in the Border Regions are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 402 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  In December, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). Taking the first and second calls of the REDF together, the Border Region had seven successful projects with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region. </p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit. As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.</p>  <p>  Last week I announced the Enterprise Ireland (EI) Annual Results where every region in Ireland recorded increases in employment, including a 9% increase in the North West and a 3% increase in the North East. Nationally, a record 215,207 people are now employed in EI supported companies.  Over 23,700 of these jobs are in the Border region. Some of the recent EI jobs announcements for the region have included 90 new jobs in E &amp;amp; I Engineering in Donegal, 80 new jobs in Crust &amp;amp; Crumb in Co. Cavan and 200 new jobs in Combilift in Co. Monaghan. </p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. </p>  <p>  In order to help build the enterprise capability in this region, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients including those in the Border region to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. </p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit.</p></reply>

Over the same period 13,398 permits were granted, an 18% increase over 2017 (11,354) so productivity is improving. My officials inform me that, at the end of 2018, approximately 2,620 applications were awaiting processing.</p><p>Good progress had been made in reducing processing times in Q4 2018, with processing times for Trusted Partners falling from 7 weeks to 5 weeks, and from 16 weeks to 12 weeks for standard applications by December last.

Being prepared is crucial to ensure resilience to emerging challenges.   In 2018, EI approved funding of &euro;74m for 535 of its most Brexit-exposed clients with exports to the UK of greater than 20%, or an average of &euro;140,000 per company to support their business growth in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>To promote awareness, and supported by a national Prepare For Brexit campaign, Enterprise Ireland (EI) launched a &euro;5k Be Prepared Grant   that supports the costs of SME clients in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. To date, 151 Be Prepared Grants have been approved to client companies.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland provides a range of other financial and non-financial supports to companies to prepare for Brexit. These include:</p>  <p>  - The Brexit SME Scorecard, an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars.</p>  <p>  - The Act On Programme which provides an independent consultant to companies for a course of two half day to assist them decide on specific actions to address some of the risks and opportunities from Brexit.</p>  <p>  - The Strategic Consultancy Grant supports the hiring of a strategic consultant typically to assist the company in the development and/or the implementation of strategic initiatives. It is designed to facilitate business growth as the consultants can act as coach, mentor, facilitator, analyst for the company.</p>  <p>  - The Market Discovery Fund specifically supports companies in their market  diversification plans. The grant aims to incentivise companies to research viable and sustainable market entry strategies.</p>  <p>  - The Agile Innovation Fund has been developed to support product, service and process innovation to build competitive advantage.</p>  <p>  - Brexit Advisory Clinics to increase the awareness of Brexit amongst companies. Last year Enterprise Ireland ran 11 Brexit advisory clinics throughout the country.  Approximately 915 people attended these events.</p>  <p>  - A new Customs Insights Online course at the end of 2018 to demystify customs procedures.  This is available for any company to use, importers or exporters and whether they are agency clients or not .  The course will highlight the responsibilities of companies and will explain some of the main customs procedures and documentation involved.</p>  <p>  A major initiative which my Department introduced last year for all Brexit impacted firms was the &euro;300 million Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme, under which accessible finance is made available to businesses at favourable terms.  So far, 332 companies have been approved for eligibility under this scheme.  My Department is also exploring the development of a longer-term Business Development Loan Scheme which would assist firms in long term investing for a post-Brexit environment. </p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices nationwide have organised a range of events and initiatives to assist their client companies prepare for Brexit. These include technical assistance, a lean for micro initiative, mentoring and training, seminars and workshops.</p>  <p>  Finally, InterTrade Ireland are rolling out a &euro;2,000 Brexit &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; readiness voucher scheme, which enables companies to purchase specialist advice in areas such as customs, tax, tariff and non-tariff barriers, legal and labour mobility issues.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland (EI) launched the Market Discovery Fund in January 2018 with the aim of encouraging companies to expand into new markets by helping with the costs of researching viable and sustainable market entry strategies. Since then, 208 Market Discovery Grants have been approved by EI. </p><p>The Fund provides support towards both internal and external costs incurred by companies when researching new markets for products and services.

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million.  </p>  <p>  It has been designed to assist eligible Irish businesses in the short-term to deal with the challenges of Brexit, which include the pressures of increased market instability and currency volatility. The scheme is open to both State Agency clients and businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies. Sole traders may also apply. </p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process.  First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans under the Brexit Loan Scheme is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures. </p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018, as of 11 January 2019, there have been 369 applications received, of which 325 have been approved, and a further 36 are being processed and 63 loans progressed to sanction at finance provider level to a value of &euro;14.8 million. Six businesses were deemed not eligible. These figures were issued as an interim update, more detailed information is available on a quarterly basis. </p>  <p>  Information on the number of businesses approved for funding by county could identify individual enterprises. A more meaningful approach is to look at the activity by industry, economic regional level and innovation criteria. For example, Manufacturing accounts for 38% of approvals, Brexit impacted exporters account for almost 50% of approvals while 20% of approved applications relate to investments in new products or markets.</p></reply>

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I made Brexit one of my top priorities in the allocations of funding for 2019 in my Department and I have allocated further funding to Brexit-related support from agencies and offices of my Department as part of Budget 2019. I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million capital funding to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22% for 2019, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment. Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises adjust to the new relationships with the UK and pursue new opportunities.</p>  <p>  Informed by detailed research, my Department has put in place a package of measures in response to the needs of businesses affected by Brexit-related uncertainty. The Brexit Loan Scheme, launched in March of 2018, provides relatively short-term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them to innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme. </p>  <p>  As at 11 January, there have been 369 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 325 have been approved to date, with a further 36 being processed by SBCI. 63 of those applications have progressed to sanction at bank value, to a total value of &euro;14.83m.</p>  <p>  Work continues on the development of the Future Growth Loan Scheme, which will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  ITI offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. As of its most recent report and the end of November 2018, 811 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 657 have been approved. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 3,700 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 151 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 165 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics.</p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs] are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, over 400 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 391 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. </p>  <p>  My Department has also been active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. These events have so far taken place in Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Dublin, Limerick and Donegal.</p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the importance of SMEs to the Irish economy. The latest Central Statistics Office (CSO) Business in Ireland 2016 report states that in Ireland, SMEs accounted for 99.8% or nearly 250,000 active enterprises and over 68% of all persons engaged. SMEs generated 50.2% of total Turnover in the business economy and over 41% of Gross Value Added was attributed to these enterprises. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s supports for SMEs include access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion, in additional to a range of progressive regulatory and oversight functions. The agencies and offices under the aegis of my Department that work directly with SMEs include Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Local Enterprise Offices, InterTradeIreland, Microfinance Ireland, Companies Registration Office, Registry of Friendly Societies, National Standards Authority of Ireland, Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, Science Foundation Ireland, Patents Office, Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Health and Safety Authority.  </p>  <p>  I have discussed the need for a strategy focused on entrepreneurs and small businesses with my officials since I became Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. We have been engaging with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regarding such a strategy. I launched the &ldquo;Review of SME and Entrepreneurship issues and policies in Ireland&rdquo; with the Secretary General of the OECD &Aacute;ngel Gurr&iacute;a and my colleague Pat Breen TD, Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection on 8 March 2018.</p>  <p>  This is a pivotal 18-month project which will see a comprehensive review of the SME business ecosystem and policies, using OECD expertise in a structured and defined process. My Department hosted two study missions in June and November of last year, where the OECD team and international experts met with over 100 stakeholders from multiple departments, agencies, representative groups and business owners.  The Small Firms Association along with other small firms&rsquo; representative groups, including members of my Department's Advisory Group on Small Business which Minster Breen chairs, and other bodies such as Chambers Ireland and ISME were involved in this engagement.   </p>  <p>  The resulting recommendations and issues identified by the report will form the basis of a long-term SME Strategy for Ireland. We will hold an SME strategy conference in Dublin in mid 2019; engaging with stakeholders and policymakers to ensure we use the levers available to enact the OECD's recommendations. It is intended to include recommended actions in the government wide Future Jobs Initiative as part of my focus on keeping small businesses at the heart of the government policy.</p>  <p>  Areas covered by the OECD analysis include taxation, the regulatory environment, productivity challenges, skills and regional development. It also includes an assessment of the main SME-targeted programme areas, including SME workforce skills, standards adoption, internationalisation, financing and innovation. </p>  <p>  I am committed to keeping the focus of the government&rsquo;s business strategy on indigenous firms. As the vast majority of Irish firms are SMEs, this strategy will be aimed at smaller companies. My Department and I will ensure that Ireland continues to be an excellent place to start, grow and scale a business.   </p>  <p>  The OECD report is due to be published in Q3 of 2019.</p></reply>

The whole of Government effort to deliver on these objectives is supported by the annual Action Plan for Jobs, and from 2019, its successor, the Future Jobs programme.</p>  <p>  The CSO estimates that between April 2017 and April 2018, 28,400 Irish emigrants returned to Ireland. As the economy continues to grow and approaches full employment, this trend is likely to continue. </p>  <p>  Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012, there are almost 385,700 more people at work bringing total employment in the State to 2,265,000 (as of Q3 2018). My Department and its agencies have a range of initiatives to connect with Irish emigrants (and others) to outline the careers and entrepreneurial opportunities in Ireland. These include:</p>  <p>  - IDA Ireland actively promotes Ireland as a location for new investment and Enterprise Ireland has specific targets to attract entrepreneurs to Ireland with a focused marketing programme underway in international markets.</p>  <p>  - Since 2016, my Department has funded TechLife Ireland- a partnership with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Irish Technology industry- to promote and brand Ireland as a top destination to pursue a career in technology and attract top tech professionals to Ireland. Industry is playing an important role in supporting the initiative and driving its development.</p>  <p>  - Science Foundation Ireland encourages leading researchers to move to Ireland raising Ireland&rsquo;s profile as a location for research excellence and career advancement: for example, through SFI&rsquo;s Future Research Leaders and Research Professorships Programmes.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would emphasise that ensuring a continued focus on attracting foreign direct investment and maintaining and improving competitiveness is critical to attracting talent back to Ireland.</p></reply>

The cost of those jobs to the State is calculated by taking into account IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland expenditure to all firms in the period of calculation. Only jobs created during and sustained to the end of each seven-year period are credited in the calculations.  </p>  <p>  The average cost per Enterprise Ireland job is &euro;4,828 in the 2011-2017 period compared to &euro;7,350 in the period 2010-2016, a decrease of 34%.  The cost per IDA Ireland job for the period 2011-2017 is &euro;8,057 compared to &euro;9,148 from 2010-2016, a decrease of almost 12%. Information for the 2012-2018 range will be available when both Agencies publish their annual reports later this year. </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland (ITI) does not measure cost-per-job but operates a range of programmes to assist small and medium enterprises (SMEs) explore new cross-border markets, develop new products, processes and services. These initiatives, through supporting cross border firms to grow and expand, do help create and sustain jobs on the island of Ireland. While figures for last year are not yet available, in 2017 there were 2,611 companies engaged in North-South business through ITI&rsquo;s trade and innovation activities &amp;amp; services. </p></reply>

These grants are an important means of encouraging companies to invest in Ireland, particularly in regional locations.  </p>  <p>  In all instances where financial assistance is approved by IDA Ireland for a client company, the Agency and the client enter into a grant agreement which is a legal and binding contract.  While the content of the contract is confidential, the agreement includes conditions and milestones that the client is required to comply with before any financial assistance is provided.</p>  <p>  Clients sign the grant agreement in full knowledge that the penalty for non-performance is a pro-rata repayment of grants.  IDA Ireland revokes grants where clients have not achieved the agreed performance target or, if appropriate, in the event of a company closure.   These cases are reported in the Agency&rsquo;s Annual Financial Statements. In 2017, the IDA recovered &euro;5.031m in respect of four clients with &euro;346,000 recovered from one client in 2016. </p>  <p>  The IDA initiated proceedings against one company in 2017. No proceedings were initiated in 2016. Information on grant repayments for 2018 will be available when the Annual Financial Statements are published as part of the Agency's Annual Report later this year.</p></reply>

The hospital will facilitate the implementation of a new model of care that will have a profound impact on all paediatric services once the new hospital is open.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken on the project since April 2017 when Government gave the green light for the construction of the hospital. Enabling works on the main hospital site are complete and Phase A construction works (substructure works on the main site), which commenced in October 2017, are also now nearing completion.  The Phase B 7-storey above ground works will begin early this year. Development is also well advanced on the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres.  Works at Connolly are on target for practical completion of the building in the Spring with the opening scheduled for July 2019.  Works at Tallaght are underway with a target hand-over date of July 2020, and the construction of the main hospital to be completed in 2022. </p>  <p>  At an early stage in the process, it was determined that the traditional method of procurement was not suitable or realistic for a project of this size and complexity. Accordingly, the contract is subject to a two-stage process with stage one consisting of a scope refinement and value engineering process, based upon tendered rates, to finalise the Phase B works (above ground). This approach allowed the early phases of work to commence on site while also allowing for the detail of later phases to be finalised and agreed.  This approach brings issues on cost to the fore much earlier in the life of the project than is the case where traditional procurement approaches are deployed.  </p>  <p>  Following the completion of the second stage of the two-stage tender procurement process, the final cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is responsible is now at &euro;1,433 million, &euro;450m more than advised to Government in April 2017.  &euro;319m of the additional cost relates to construction costs, and the balance of &euro;131m, which includes &euro;50m in VAT, relates to costs associated with staff, consultants, planning, design team fees, risk/contingency, and Management Equipment Service.</p>  <p>  As I have already stated the increased cost is a matter of great concern and I have made it clear that Phase B of the construction project must be delivered within budget and timescale. Accordingly, there will be an independent review, commencing in January, of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum, the contributory factors and associated responsibilities so that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will be required to provide on-going assurance to the HSE, Department of Health and Government that Phase B of the project is being delivered within budget and timescale.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. No participant will pay more that the actual cost of care.</p><p>Under NHSS rental income is considered income for the purpose of the financial assessment, and is assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions. </p><p>Action 17 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector commits the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government (DHPLG) to examine the treatment under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme's financial assessment of income from the rental of a person's principal private residence where they move into long term residential care. The Department of Health is currently engaging with the DHPLG in this regard.</p><p>It also is worth noting that the decision to rent out a home resides with the home-owner, therefore creating the possibility of older people in nursing homes becoming landlords and taking on the many responsibilities associated with that role. This would involve the consideration of many practicalities. As such, there are significant complexities in examining changes to the NHSS, particularly to ensure the ongoing fair, equitable and sustainable operation of the scheme. As a result there are competing interests and issues that must be fully considered.</p></reply>

The proposal is to utilise Section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 to formalise a new model for collaborative working within Government, and placing these on a statutory footing. This section has never been utilised before, and there are a number of administrative, budgetary, governance and legal arrangements that need to be put in place to ensure a robust and workable model for Pathfinder. Currently consultation is ongoing between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to progress these issues as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April.  </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. </p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity and the HSE has advised that, currently, results of smear tests may take up to 20 weeks from the time of the test, and that it may take longer in a small number of cases. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. The HSE reports that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to minimise the backlog. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. However, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan to take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. The issue remains a priority concern for me, for my Department and for the HSE. </p>  <p>  While the provision of out of cycle smears ceased on the 31 December 2018, it is important to be clear that this backlog will take some time to resolve. It remains a priority concern for me, for my Department and for the HSE.</p></reply>

The overarching principle is that families play an important role in the care of their loved one and that visiting should be facilitated in the interest of the resident unless there are compelling reasons why this cannot be done.</p>  <p>  At the request of the Director General the HSE commissioned a report from the National Director of Community Operations to ascertain the facts in relation to the instances of visiting restrictions in place in each of the nine Community Healthcare Organisations. </p>  <p>  Each Chief Officer was requested to ensure that where a restriction has been applied that this should be kept under on-going review, that the guiding principle of maximum inclusion of families is upheld and that the consideration of the issue is informed by the most recent regulatory report in respect of each centre insofar as that report makes reference to families, family&rsquo;s views, visiting, inclusion etc.</p>  <p>  Each Chief Officer has now reviewed the restrictions currently in place within their area of responsibility. On foot of this review the HSE has advised the Department that it does not routinely use visiting restrictions in residential care centres across the country.  There are currently 11 instances where visiting to residents is restricted across the country across public Older Persons and Mental Health Services. This is in the context of currently providing over 7,000 such beds across those services. In addition, visiting restrictions are in place in relation to 3 residents in Disability Centres.  </p>  <p>  In some instances, the residents in question are Wards of Court and in other cases, family members hold Enduring Power of Attorney and have requested certain restrictions. In other cases, there are safeguarding concerns.</p>  <p>  The cases need to be viewed in the context of the entire service and reflects the HSE&rsquo;s aspiration that restrictions to visiting are a last resort after all other appropriate interventions have failed. In the case of one of the individuals featured on the Prime Time programme, a mediation process is being progressed.</p>  <p>  In a broader sense, the Government has approved the development of a national adult safeguarding policy for the health sector and work to formulate this policy is under way. The policy, when developed, will cover the public, voluntary and private health sector and will include proposals on collaboration, information-sharing and referral arrangements between the health sector and other key sectors. It is intended to circulate a draft policy for public consultation around the end of 2019 before submitting final policy proposals to Government for approval.  Following Government approval, appropriate underpinning legislation will be prepared.</p></reply>

The termination may then be carried out after the third day has "elapsed". For example, if the woman visits the doctor and the doctor certifies that the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks on a Monday, then Monday counts as the first day. Tuesday and Wednesday are the second and third day. Once Wednesday has "elapsed" the termination may take place, so it may be carried out at any time on Thursday.</p></reply>

The process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. In addition, the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year. The review is on-going and the Committee intends to publish its report early this year. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department are working with the HSE to develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  The Government has approved a &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to providing public AHR treatment during 2019. Officials in my Department are currently examining options in relation to the operation and administration of this fund, which includes determining the access criteria that will apply. Once I have had the opportunity to review and approve these proposals, there will be an announcement regarding the commencement of this fund for 2019.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, currently, patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

Under the Health Act 1970 (as amended), the HSE is required to levy statutory private in-patient charges on all patients opting to receive private in-patient services, irrespective of the type of accommodation provided.  The charging regime now distinguishes between the accommodation of private patients in single rooms and multi-occupancy rooms with the former charged at a higher rate.</p>  <p>  The allocation of single rooms within public hospitals is closely aligned with the clinical needs of patients and is therefore dictated on operational or clinical grounds and not on the public or private status of the patient, so patients are not guaranteed a single room on admittance to a public hospital. </p></reply>

Members of the Traveller community are recognised in this strategy as being one of the priority groupings most vulnerable to suicide. </p>  <p>  To address this issue, targeted mental health and stigma reduction campaigns are in development for the Travelling community. To date, this has involved focus group testing of the national mental health Little Things campaign messaging with traveller groups. Based on this process, the National Office for Suicide Prevention will further develop the communication campaigns using appropriate messaging and media channels for this target population group. The Samaritans (funded under the Connecting for Life strategy) are also working at a local level to promote their service to this priority group. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE and Primary Care Social Inclusion currently funds Exchange House Ireland to deliver targeted health programmes. This includes two suicide prevention projects targeting the Traveller Community; the National Traveller Suicide Prevention Service and Travelling to Wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Exchange House Ireland provides a range of services and supports to approximately 8,000 Travellers annually. The National Office for Suicide Prevention commissioned a review of the projects (2016-2017) in line with its goal to build the evidence base in support of targeted initiatives for priority groups, and to further inform its role in funding suicide prevention initiatives and establish how the existing projects align with the Connecting for Life strategy.</p>  <p>  The Oversight Group working on the refresh of the Vision for Change national mental health policy proposes that policy changes will benefit all those engaging with mental health services. The Terms of Reference for the Group place a particular emphasis on social inclusion and the needs of vulnerable groups, including the Traveller community, which will be incorporated into the final report with a focus on reducing stigma and discrimination. </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality led on the development of the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy which was published in June 2017. The Strategy contains a set of specific actions aimed at improving the situation for Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland, including agreed health-related actions. The HSE is developing a detailed action plan on Traveller health as one of the commitments in the Strategy.   </p>  <p>  I understand the draft action plan is being finalised by the HSE.</p></reply>

It was in this knowledge that when proposals for the joint HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund Inpatient and Day Case Action Plan were under development last year, I sought a particular focus on reducing waiting times for a number of high volume specialties including cataracts.  The Action Plan, allocated a quarter (5,000 out of 20,000) of the planned NTPF procedures to cataract treatments.</p><p>Waiting list figures for December 2018, published last week by the NTPF show that considerable improvements have been made to the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure which have fallen to 70,204 from the peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. Over the same period, the waiting lists for Cataracts has reduced from over 10,000 to 6,440 representing a reduction of 36%.</p><p>Furthermore, the number of patients waiting over 9 months has almost halved since July 2017 from 28,100 to 14,900.The impact is particularly noteworthy when one considers the improvements to the Waiting Lists for those particular specialties which were the focus of the Inpatient/Daycase Action Plan in 2018 including the numbers waiting over 9 months for a Cataract procedure which have fallen by 87% since July 2017. </p><p>The Action Plan also recommended that the HSE and NTPF identify sustainable initiatives to improve waiting times. In this context, a dedicated centre for cataract surgery in Nenagh opened last July, and at full capacity will be capable of delivering up to 2,000 procedures annually.  The centre is ideally located to enable the UL hospital group, in collaboration with the HSE and NTPF, to maximise the use of the Centre through collaboration with other hospital groups so that patients from surrounding regions can be referred to the Centre for their treatment.</p><p>My Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise a Scheduled Care Access Plan for inpatients/daycase and outpatients for 2019. In this regard, the NTPF and HSE will continue to work closely with Hospital Groups, inviting proposals to improve access for patients waiting for hospital procedures. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following documents. <table><tr><th>-</th><th></th><th></th><th>Sum of Amount</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Column Labels</th></tr><tr><td>Row Labels </td><td>0-3 Mths </td><td>3-6 Mths </td><td></td><td>6-9 Mths </td><td>9-12 Mths</td><td>12-15 Mths</td><td>Grand Total</td></tr><tr><td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td><td></td><td>41</td><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td></td><td>41</td><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>81</td></tr></table></p><p>Average Wait Time (days) - Kerry Resident  123</p><p>Average Wait Time (days) - General 128<table><tr><th>-</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Sum of Amount</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>Column Labels</th></tr><tr><td>Row Labels </td><td>0-3 Months </td><td>3-6 Months </td><td>6-9 Months </td><td>9-12 Months</td><td>12-15 Months</td><td>15-18 Months</td><td>18-24 Mths</td><td>24+ Mths</td><td>Grand Total</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>835</td><td>500</td><td>352</td><td>168</td><td>147</td><td>119</td><td>199</td><td>117</td><td>2437</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>835</td><td>500</td><td>352</td><td>168</td><td>147</td><td>119</td><td>199</td><td>117</td><td>2437</td></tr></table></p><p>Average Wait Time (days) - Kerry Resident 241</p><p>Average Wait Time (days) - General 252</p></reply>

As part of this function, the NTPF enters into "Approved Nursing Home Agreements" with registered private and voluntary nursing homes to record the maximum price(s) that have been negotiated. </p>  <p>  The NTPF take the following guidelines into account in negotiating prices; (a) costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money, (b) price(s) previously charged, (c) local market price and (d) budgetary constraints and the obligation of the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p>  <p>  The Report of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring  value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs  for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing  the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring  that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail. </p>  <p>  The NTPF are now close to completing the report and aim to discuss the draft report and next steps early this year.</p>  <p>  Once complete the report of the review will then be submitted to the Department. </p></reply>

It states that where he/she has a conscientious objection, a medical practitioner, nurse or midwife shall not be obliged to carry out, or participate in the carrying out, a termination of pregnancy.  The Act makes it clear that conscientious objection cannot be invoked in an emergency situation, when the risk to a pregnant woman&rsquo;s life or health is immediate.  </p><p>In the event of a doctor, nurse or midwife having a difficulty in undertaking a required medical procedure, he or she will have a duty to make arrangements for the transfer of the woman&rsquo;s care to a colleague.</p><p>I brought amendments to this section in the D&aacute;il to ensure that it is clear that conscientious objection extends to all those who may be asked to directly  participate in providing termination of pregnancy services, including students.  The amendments ensured that student nurses and midwives are clear that they may refuse to participate in termination of pregnancy procedures on the grounds that they have a conscientious objection. Medical practitioners were already covered by Section 22.  </p><p>It would not be reasonable to include any other personnel such as pharmacists, as this could have the effect of blocking a woman&rsquo;s access to a lawfully provided and, in some cases, medically-indicated treatment.  </p><p>However, pharmacists are obliged to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct for Pharmacists, published by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  Principle 1 of the Code of Conduct states that &ldquo;<i>a pharmacist should ensure that in instances where they are unable to provide prescribed medicines or pharmacy services to a patient, they must take reasonable action to ensure these medicines/services are provided and the patients care is not jeopardised.&rdquo;</i></p><p>I understand that the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has approved a new Code of Conduct for pharmacists, which it will be submitting to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for approval before it comes to me as Minister for approval.</p><p>Part 5 of Principle 4 on page 9 of the proposed Code of Conduct makes provision for conscientious objection, subject to the pharmacist referring a patient to an alternative provider if the pharmacist cannot provide a professional service or medicinal product, so that patient care is not jeopardised or compromised. </p><p>A footnote to the Principle makes specific reference to a pharmacist transferring the care of a pregnant woman who wishes to avail of services for the termination of pregnancy.</p></reply>

Several of the PSI&rsquo;s functions under the Pharmacy Act 2007 relate to education, including promoting and ensuring the highest standards in education and training for the qualification to practise as a pharmacist, and make sure that relevant experience is gained in the course of that pharmacy education and training. </p>  <p>  In 2010 the PSI commissioned a review of the five year programme of education and training for the pharmacist qualification in Ireland. One of the recommendations included the introduction of an integrated 5-year Masters level programme of education and training for pharmacists in line with international best practice, to replace the previous 4 year Bachelor plus 1 year in-service practical training programme.</p>  <p>  A National Forum was established to advise and assist the Council of the PSI in its oversight of the development and ongoing delivery of the new fully integrated programme of pharmacy education, training and assessment. The National Forum for Pharmacy Education and Accreditation Interim Report of November 2013 noted that it was an essential component of the integrated degree that the student remain a student for the full five years of study. Under the previous model, students became employees during their final year. </p>  <p>  Since September 2015, students commencing their pharmacy education undertake a PSI-accredited five-year fully integrated Master&rsquo;s degree programme in pharmacy, with the first cohort awarded this MPharm degree graduating in 2020. This programme is operated by the schools of pharmacy in three universities in Ireland (Trinity College Dublin, University College Cork and Royal College of Surgeons Ireland). </p>  <p>  This newer pharmacy programme provides for both the academic and practical experience that is required by students to qualify to practise as a pharmacist in Ireland. Students qualify after 5 years with a Masters in Pharmacy and are eligible to apply for registration as a pharmacist with the PSI.</p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Education and Training) (Integrated Course) Rules 2014 (S.I. No. 377 of 2014) is the legislation which underpins the new 5 year MPharm educational programme. It includes the programme recognition and accreditation requirements, and details about the in-service training placements for students. </p>  <p>  Part of the PSI&rsquo;s accreditation process involves visits to the universities operating the MPharm programme, which includes meeting with representative students at each School of Pharmacy. The accreditation teams assess the programme of training and education various standards, including one related to students and the supports available to students.</p>  <p>  The PSI has stated that it will continue to engage with the academic institutions that deliver the MPharm programme and their role is to ensure the quality of the MPharm programme and high standards in education and training for the qualification to practise as a pharmacist. </p></reply>

This figure does not include those in short stay or transitional care beds, nor does it include those residents of private facilities that pay for their own service outside of the NHSS.  The Health Information &amp;amp; Quality Authority website has information on the number of registered beds for each designated residential care centre, public and private. </p>  <p>  The Department's "Health in Ireland - Key Trends 2018" report, published last month, indicates that in 2017 there were 30,674 residential care beds registered with HIQA.  It is not possible to determine the exact total number of people in residential care beds at a given time except for those that residents that are supported under the NHSS.</p>  <p>  The Capacity Review published earlier this year, in addition to recognising the pressures being faced across the health system in terms of access to healthcare, was also an indication of the Government&rsquo;s desire to plan appropriately for the future.  Analysis of future scenarios (based on demographic projections and taking account of envisaged reform measures) shows potential requirements for the period to 2031.  On the back of these findings, the Government committed to providing 4,500 additional short and long term residential care beds in the National Development Plan.  The exact criteria for the planning and design of these beds will be evaluated on a phased basis as the projects are approved.</p></reply>

The use of transitional care has proven very valuable to the hospital system and has benefitted the transfer of a significant number of patients to more appropriate settings on their journey home or alternative residential care settings.  The national service plan set an expected activity target of 9,160 transitional care approvals for 2018 and preliminary data indicates that there were approximately 11,000 approvals.  The expected activity target for this year is 10,980 which is broadly in line with last year&rsquo;s activity.  </p>  <p>  In relation to residential service provision beyond the transitional phase the HSE's approach for 2019 is set out in the 2019 service plan, that is, having regard to the available resource, to maximise access to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, NHSS, for eligible applicants, and to continue to make every effort to maintain the waiting list for funding at the current average four week level, as was the case in 2018 , particularly during the peak period of demand.</p></reply>

The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;80 per day, up to a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 consecutive months. All persons accessing public in-patient services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory public-inpatient charge, subject to a number of exemptions, including where a person is a medical cardholder.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework therefore obliges the HSE to levy the statutory in-patient charge on all patients not covered by an exemption. As noted, medical card holders are exempt from hospital charges, however the exemption is only valid from the date of issue of the medical card. Therefore patients continue to be liable for any charges which occurred before a medical card has been issued.</p></reply>

It was in this knowledge that when proposals for the joint HSE-National Treatment Purchase Fund Inpatient and Day Case Action Plan were under development last year, I sought a particular focus on reducing waiting times for a number of high volume specialties including cataracts.  The Action Plan, allocated a quarter (5,000 out of 20,000) of the planned NTPF procedures to cataract treatments.</p>  <p>  Waiting list figures for December 2018, published last week by the NTPF show that considerable improvements have been made to the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure which have fallen to 70,204 from 81,500 in December 2017. This represents a reduction of over 14% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. </p>  <p>  In terms of the number of people waiting for cataract treatment in 2017 and 2018 and the average waiting times, the NTPF advise that at the end of 2017 there were 8,027 people waiting for a cataract procedure, with an average waiting time of 195 days, while at the end of 2018 there were 6,440 people waiting for a cataract procedure, with an average waiting time of 131 days. This represents a decrease in numbers waiting of 20% and a reduction in average waiting time of 33%. </p>  <p>  The action plan also recommended that the HSE and NTPF identify sustainable initiatives to improve waiting times. In this context, a dedicated centre for cataract surgery in Nenagh opened last July, and at full capacity will be capable of delivering up to 2,000 procedures annually.  The centre is ideally located to enable the UL hospital group, in collaboration with the HSE and NTPF, to maximise the use of the Centre through collaboration with hospital groups so that patients from surrounding regions can be referred to the centre for their treatment.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise a scheduled care access plan for inpatients/daycase and outpatients for 2019. In this regard, the NTPF and HSE will continue to work closely with hospital groups, inviting proposals to improve access for patients waiting for hospital procedures. </p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.</p><p>Clinical concern arose as usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme, MMP, reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p><p>From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: <i>hse.ie/yourmedicines</i>.</p><p>The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursement of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician. The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.</p><p>The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process for a particular treatment is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products.  The IBTS constantly keeps all deferral policies under review to ensure the ongoing safety of blood and the products derived from it.</p><p>The IBTS is regulated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) which is the designated Competent Authority under Irish and European Law.  The testing procedures at the IBTS are therefore subject to regular audit by the HPRA.</p><p>The IBTS does not generally utilise individual risk assessment.  However, the IBTS performs laboratory tests for multiple disease markers on every donation.  Tests for the following infectious agents are done on each occasion a donor gives blood</p><p>- Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) types 1 &amp;amp; 2</p><p>- Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)</p><p>- Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)</p><p>- Hepatitis E virus (HEV)</p><p>- Syphilis (Treponema pallidum)</p><p>- Human T-Lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type 1 and 2</p><p>The testing carried out includes serology, which essentially detects antibodies, and Nucleic Acid testing (NAT) which detects viral genetic material.  NAT is very sensitive and is capable of detecting early infections before antibodies are formed.  Any donation that is positive for any one of these tests cannot be used for transfusion purposes and is discarded.  Further testing is carried out to confirm true infection. </p><p>The IBTS also performs selective laboratory tests for certain disease markers based on travel exposure (e.g. West Nile Disease).  A certain proportion of the blood supply is tested for Cytomegalovirus (CMV).  This is to mitigate the risk of transmission of this common virus to particularly vulnerable patients.  All blood is also leucodepleted (i.e. the removal of white blood cells) which adds another layer of protection against CMV infection. </p></reply>

I have therefore referred your question to the HSE, so that they may reply directly to you on this matter.</p>  <p>  However, the Department of Health did provide a small amount of funding to support advocacy services, with a grant funding agreement being put in place in late 2018 with the Irish Cancer Society, acting on behalf of the CervicalCheck Patient Support Group.  The Support Group received &euro;150,167 in 2018 to establish a service to provide information, advice and support in a structured and confidential manner to patients and next of kin of those directly affected by the CervicalCheck screening programme and subsequent ongoing official enquiries and investigations.  The Support Group had one permanent employee and three voluntary patient representatives as of December 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Health commissioned the establishment of a national Patient Safety Advocacy Service in 2018.  The service contract was awarded in December 2018.  A first payment of &euro;197,100.00 was made in December 2018 to enable the establishment of the service and allow it to commence recruitment and source necessary facilities for the commencement of activities in the second half of 2019.</p>  <p>  In May 2018, on an exceptional, once-off basis, funding of &euro;195,000 was provided by the Department to the Irish Deaf Society, an organisation involved in advocacy for the deaf community. </p></reply>

HPV is one of the most closely studied and monitored medicinal products around.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information.

Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish Health Service.  The OECD report on Pharmaceutical Innovation and Access to Medicines draws on an evidence-based assessment of the current performance of the pharmaceutical innovation system, and presents a critical analysis of policy options for reforms to promote access and sustainability.  Officials in the Department are aware of this report.</p>  <p>  Ireland is already engaging in a number of the recommendations contained in the report through its international agenda, most notably through its membership of the Beneluxa initiative.  The Beneluxa collaboration seeks to enhance patients' access to high quality and affordable treatments, improve the payers' position in the market through joint negotiations, increase transparency on pricing between the collaborating countries, share policy expertise and focus on knowledge building.</p>  <p>  Members of the Beneluxa Initiative will work closely together to identify pragmatic solutions to the challenges which we all now face with medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.</p>  <p>  The OECD Report also contains recommendations relating to policy options to address the current challenges and advocates for engagement between the State and Industry.   I believe that partnership with industry is key to improving access to new medicines.  At the last bi-annual meeting between my Department and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) a proposed dialogue was discussed.  It is envisioned that this will take the form of a structured platform of engagement, building a stronger partnership between the State and industry to create better patient access to new treatments.</p>  <p>  An Open Policy Forum also took place on Thursday 15 November 2018 with the Department of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Department of Health and the IPHA.</p>  <p>  I look forward to more engagement over the course of the year with the aim of building a fairer partnership between industry and the State to help ensure that Irish patients get sustainable access to new medicines in as timely a manner as possible.</p></reply>

It identified a number of other factors including geographic location and work/life balance. The Commission also recognised that implementation of the settlement of the 2008 Consultant Contract claim, while necessary of itself, would serve to highlight further the differential in pay between the pre-existing cadre of consultants and new entrants. </p>  <p>  Given its analysis, the Pay Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential between pre-existing consultants and new entrant consultants.

The changing demographics and the implications for future health care costs underpin the importance of developing a wider choice of appropriate housing options for older people.  The objective is to encourage and facilitate timely planning by older people for their future housing needs, and to rebalance the care model away from residential care to supporting people to remain in their own communities for as long as possible.  As the research shows, this reflects the preferences of older people themselves. </p>  <p>  Our aim is to ensure that older people will have more choice  by developing a range of housing options that are suited to their needs, so they can choose the right option for them. These options may include supported community developments akin to retirement villages, housing with supports projects or other initiatives.</p>  <p>  Varying levels of support will be needed to enable older people to continue living in their own homes and communities, including care needs where appropriate. However, it is envisaged that there will always be a cohort of people for whom residential nursing home care is the most appropriate option. The main issue is the significant gap in alternative or intermediary options. This is the issue that I wish to address. There is a need to put in place suitable options to give older people the choice and importantly, to ensure that care is provided in the most appropriate setting. This aligns with the vision of Sl&aacute;intecare where there is an overarching aim to bring care closer to the community and the person's home. </p>  <p>  In November of last year, I hosted an expert conference on housing for older people with my colleague Mr. Damien English T.D. Minister for Housing and Urban Development. The overwhelming view of participants, shared by experts, was that the development of a range of community supports and services in close proximity to older people is key to enabling them to remain living in their chosen environment. The outcome of this conference are being used by officials from both Departments working collaboratively together to inform the development of a suitable policy framework for housing for older people. </p>  <p>  This work is actively progressing and a policy framework will be published later this year. </p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. </p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the community drugs schemes, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>As outlined in the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine. </p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>The NCPE competed a health technology assessment on 29 August 2018 for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). They recommended that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. </p><p>On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed their assessment for Ocrelizumab indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.  </p><p>The HSE is the statutory decision-making body for medicine reimbursement. It will make the final decision on whether Ocrelizumab will be reimbursed, taking into consideration the statutory criteria in the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. As such, in the context of the question raised, there are no plans to change the nature of the Scheme in this regard. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  It is worth noting that applicants to the scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. However, in order for financial support to be provided, the nursing home must have an available bed and be able to cater for the applicant's care needs.</p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. </p><p>Furthermore, applicants to scheme have the option of applying for The Nursing Home Loan (Ancillary State Support). This is an additional financial support offered through the scheme, the purpose of which is to ensure that a person does not have to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for long-term nursing home care.  It is a personal choice and decision for the person going into long term care under the NHSS if they want to avail of this support. </p></reply>

The policy will apply across the wide spectrum of the health sector, i.e. in the public, private and voluntary sectors, and will be supported by any necessary legislation. The development of this policy is now underway.</p><p>The HSE published its national adult safeguarding operational policy and procedures, Safeguarding Vulnerable People at Risk of Abuse, in December 2014. This provides clear guidelines and procedures for staff to follow in cases of suspected abuse or neglect of vulnerable adults (including older people). This safeguarding policy was the first such HSE operational policy to encompass both elder abuse concerns and concerns of abuse and neglect relating to people availing of disability services.</p><p>The HSE has established a number of structures to implement its national operational safeguarding policy. This includes:</p><p>- A National Safeguarding Office leading the implementation of the policy; </p><p>- Specialist Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each of the 9 Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) areas; </p><p>- Nomination of by service providers of more than 1,500 designated safeguarding officers; </p><p>- Approximately 43,000 attendances at safeguarding policy and procedures training; and  </p><p>- An advisory National Safeguarding Committee.</p><p>A detailed review of the operation of the HSE&rsquo;s operational safeguarding policy is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed soon. It is expected that the learning identified from the HSE's review will also help to inform the development of the national policy. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Health Act 2007 provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), its inspection and regulation of designated residential centres for (i) people with disabilities, (ii) older people, and (iii) children, and the framework for registration of these designated centres. </p><p>HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are currently in the process of jointly developing National Standards for Adult Safeguarding, with advisory input from the Department of Health among others. </p><p>Taken together, the Department&rsquo;s national health sector adult safeguarding policy and legislation, the HSE&rsquo;s revised operational policy and HIQA and the MHC&rsquo;s joint national standards should ensure the continued evolution and improvement of the safeguarding of adults (including older people) who may be at risk in the health sector.</p></reply>

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April. Many thousands of women contacted the CervicalCheck helpline. Requests for additional supports and reassurance were considered in this context, including the provision of an opportunity for a GP consultation for women who wished to discuss their request for a repeat smear. Provision for these out-of-cycle smears ceased at the end of last year, as envisaged, in the context of the reassurance provided by the Report of the Scoping Inquiry about the quality management processes within the laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the waiting times for results of smear tests, this has resulted from an overall increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests, including out-of-cycle smears and increased uptake of scheduled screening. This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the laboratories to manage this and to improve turnaround times for smear tests, and has reported that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to minimise the backlog. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. However, the core challenge in relation to smear test turnaround times is availability of laboratory capacity. Sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan to address available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. </p>  <p>  Extra funding to address laboratory capacity issues has not been sought by the HSE.  However, significant additional funding has been allocated in 2019 to implement the recommendations of Dr Gabriel Scally&rsquo;s inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme as well as to implement the switch to HPV testing as the primary screening.</p></reply>

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s.  A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth FHC. A final site investigation report was received in October 2016 and has been assessed by the Department's Engineers. This report included vital information on the nature and amount of the material to be dredged.</p><p>The Department also appointed a Consulting Engineer in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project. A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that while the material cannot be considered inert, it can be classified as non hazardous. This means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost. </p><p>Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is ongoing in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. It would be the Department's view that the material should be treated and re-used to reclaim much needed additional ground for Harbour use.</p><p>This project will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) and a Waste License. The permitting process is likely to take up to 24 months. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors. </p><p>The Department went to tender on the 3<sup>rd</sup>of October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase, and should a decision be made to progress the project, this consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works. The successful tender was commissioned for these works on the 19<sup>th</sup>of December 2018.</p><p>While final decisions haven&rsquo;t been made on the full suite of projects to be undertaken under the 2019 Capital Programme at this stage, the continuation of the preparatory works for a dredging project in Howth as set out above can be expected. As is the case for all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging works project in Howth will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

The programme is overseen by the BVD Implementation Group (BVDIG). My Department is  represented on the Group along with farmers, veterinary practitioners and industry experts. The primary testing/surveillance method is through the testing of ear tissue (taken by farmers using tissue tags) from all calves born. This is supplemented by funding from my Department for supplementary blood testing and financial supports as well as the Targeted Advisory Service on Animal Health (TASAH) visits by trained veterinary practitioners under the Rural Development Programme. The operational details of the programme are made by the BVDIG. The agreed 2019 programme foresees a continuation of the tissue tagging of calves, as well as the aforementioned further supports.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the programme results indicate very significant progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of this disease &ndash; with the Persistently Infected (PI) birth rate falling from 0.66% in 2013 (the first year of the Compulsory Programme) to 0.06% in 2018. Indeed, the number of positive herds has reduced considerably  from 11.27% (9,485) of breeding herds in 2013 to 1.08% (815) herds in 2018.  In the early years of the eradication programme, there was a reluctance by some herdowners to dispose of their PI calves at an early stage.  The introduction of herd restrictions and  a system of neighbour notifications to ensure that they can take the most appropriate biosecurity measures to protect their herds has  helped speed up the removal process and  this has greatly assisted the eradication programme.</p></reply>

This policy protects the public ownership of quotas and protects against property rights being established which would transfer ownership of quotas into private hands.  EU Regulation provides for the carry over of up to 10% of 2018 final quota, if uncaught, to 2019.  Policy provides that an 11% allocation of Ireland's  2019 Celtic Sea herring quota will be made available to the Sentinel fishery in 2019, the available national quota will be adjusted to include any carry over (up to 10%) of uncaught quota in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Celtic Sea Herring Sentinel fishery is opened to vessels &amp;lt;17 metres in length overall which are not ring fenced in the main fishery.

There was a wide diversity of views expressed in these submissions, which are  published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>I carefully considered the issues raised during the public consultation process and, following a detailed evaluation,  decided to exclude trawling by fishing vessels over 18 metres from inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020.  This refers to overall length of the vessel.</p><p>Based on my assessment, I consider that there is a compelling case for excluding trawling by large vessels in coastal waters inside six nautical miles. I am satisfied that there are sufficient fishing opportunities for these vessels outside of six nautical miles.  I also believe that these actions will provide wider ecosystem benefits, including for nursery areas and juvenile fish stocks.  I am very conscious of the exclusive reliance of small scale and island fishermen on inshore waters and the benefits this change will bring for those fishermen. I firmly believe that this will, in the medium term, provide ecosystem and nursery stock benefits for all fishermen.</p><p>I am mindful of the opportunity these measures will provide for further sustainable development of the small scale inshore and the sea angling sectors, which the Government has committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p><p>I also announced that there will be a transition period to 2022 for vessels over 18 metres targeting sprat. This transition is in order to allow a period of adjustment for these vessels, as this fishery is concentrated inside the 6 nautical mile zone.</p><p>I recognise that effective change needs time. I have had an extensive and prolonged consultation to flag consideration of change. Allowing a transition period for those vessels involved in the sprat fishery will ensure that the vessels have adequate time to transition to other fishing activities. I have asked BIM to offer affected vessel owners technical assistance to adjust to other fisheries during the transition process<i>.</i></p><p>Vessels over 18 metres vessels will continue to be permitted inside 6 nautical miles to trawl for sprat only until 2022. A total allowable catch of up to 2,000 tonnes, reflecting a reduction on recent years, will be permitted for these vessels during 2020, reducing to 1,000 tonnes in 2021. All trawling activity by vessels over 18 metres vessels for sprat, inside the 6 mile limit, will end from the beginning of 2022.</p></reply>

If evidence was established of infection being introduced by badgers, this would trigger a survey in the area adjacent to the diseased herd for signs of badger activity and seek to identify the location of badger setts.  A targeted removal program would follow the completion of these surveys which involved trapping/removing badgers within a 2km radius of the affected farm to reduce local badger densities.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while a group of farmers in a locality cannot request a badger culling of the area, the Minister would encourage any such groups experiencing serious breakdowns of bTB to contact their local Regional Veterinary Office to ensure that an investigation by the state veterinarian has commenced where badgers have been identified as a source of bTB.</p></reply>

Commission Implementing Regulation 262/2015 (CR 262/2015), which came into effect on 1 January 2016, lays down the rules governing the identification of equidae. This legislation was transposed into national legislation in Ireland via the European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations (S.I. No 62 of 2016)(as amended).</p>  <p>  Article 12(1) of CR 262/2015 provides that all equine animals must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal, and in any event, before moving permanently from the holding of origin.</p>  <p>  Proper identification of an equine cannot be established visually.  Identification of an equine animal is primarily established through its passport, with the microchip (where required) providing further validation.</p>  <p>  Equine passports are issued by Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs) approved by my Department. Information available from these organisations suggests that high rates of compliance with the identification rules are being achieved.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of equine identification legislation is primarily undertaken by authorised officers throughout my Department's Regional Office network. These officers work closely with their veterinary colleagues across the various Local Authorities and liaise with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Commissioners Officials, as required. Authorised officers from my Department engage in checks at sales venues including marts and fairs, as well as at horse slaughter plants and at export points including ports and airports. These compliance checks are on-going and will continue to be undertaken.</p>  <p>  My Department is not aware of issues relating to unidentified equines in the north County Cork area.</p></reply>

If the complainant is dissatisfied with the response received from the Head of the relevant business area, the complaint can be sent to the Quality Service Unit who will examine any customer service aspect of the complaint. The Quality Service Unit will have the matter fully and impartially investigated by an officer who was not involved in the matter giving rise to the complaint.</p><p>3. If the complainant remains dissatisfied after steps 1 and 2 above, it is open to the complainant to contact the Office of the Ombudsman.<b></b>The Office of the Ombudsman examines complaints from people who feel they have been unfairly treated by certain public bodies, for example, Government Departments. </p><p>Customer Service complaints are not sub-categorised in my Department and, having regard to my Department&rsquo;s data protection obligations, specific detail in respect of the complaints referred to in the table above cannot be provided, but I can advise that in general they involve dissatisfaction with matters such as alleged:</p><p>- Delays in responses to correspondence.</p><p>- Delays in payments.</p><p>- Lack of notice for inspections. </p><p>- Complaints regarding Department staff.</p><p>My Department does not maintain records in respect of the number of customer service complaints received by the Ombudsman that are a continuation of complaints received by the Quality Service Unit of my Department as part of my Department&rsquo;s Customer Service Complaints Procedure.

The use of a 5 year average ensures that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.</p>  <p>  Since single stock management was introduced in 2007, the river Shannon has been assessed as the Upper Shannon (upstream of Parteen) and Mulkear. The section of the lower Shannon, below Parteen to Limerick was included in the Mulkear. The salmon stock assessment in this regard was based on the run of salmon recorded on the Mulkear fish counter. </p>  <p>  In this year&rsquo;s assessment, the Scientific Group, at the request of local angling groups to establish a separate conservation limit for the Lower Shannon, assessed the wetted area elements of the entire Shannon catchment and determined that it was appropriate to calculate a separate conservation limit for the Lower Shannon, separate to the Mulkear. This has been set at 4,204 fish in order to sustain a healthy population.</p>  <p>  Based on the scientific assessments and management advice from IFI, there is no quota (sustainable harvest) available for salmon for the Lower Shannon catchment for 2019. The lower Shannon is not, therefore, open to salmon angling for the 2019 season. </p>  <p>  As part of the stock assessment process for 2019 full catchment wide electro-fishing surveys are planned Positive results from such surveys may result in a river opening to catch and release angling but would not support a harvest fishery.</p></reply>

The fund was established in 2007 and facilitates stakeholder and Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) projects. It was first opened to third party (stakeholder) projects in 2011. Since then, draw-down of funds by stakeholders totalling close to &euro;800,000 has been made across 83 projects. There is a further &euro;1.48 million committed to projects awaiting project completion and drawdown.</p>  <p>  I am advised by IFI that the fund currently contains &euro;1.49 million for further allocation and receipts for 2018, currently being processed, are expected to generate an additional &euro;300,000. </p>  <p>  Following significant research and consultation IFI launched the National Strategy for Angling Development (NSAD) as the first comprehensive national framework for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s angling resource. The strategy supports IFI&rsquo;s role to conserve, protect, manage and promote Ireland&rsquo;s inland fisheries and sea angling resource which contributes some &euro;836 million annually to the economy. </p>  <p>  IFI recognises the key role played by angling clubs and other stakeholder organisations in fisheries development and the NSAD aims to engage stakeholders and maximise the use of volunteerism where it is of benefit to habitat and fisheries development. </p>  <p>  All projects are expected to comply with general, financial and environmental governance requirements. IFI acknowledges the challenges for many stakeholder voluntary organisations in meeting governance requirements and has provided a project management office, project officers, online guidance, workshops and meetings to support applications. Developing a project necessarily involves multiple considerations, including Special Areas of Conservation (SAC&rsquo;s) under the Habitats Directive, Special Protected Areas (SPA&rsquo;s) under the Birds Directive, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the obligation to achieve good ecological status of water. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the issue of permission under the Planning Acts is a matter for the relevant Local Authority. As with all funding schemes subject to public governance, requirements relating to statutory permissions, landowner consent etc. are standard. Applicants are asked to confirm that all statutory and environmental requirements are met before funding can be paid. It is for applicants to take a cautious and responsible approach in these matters and IFI cannot set aside or ignore established statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to planning permission, while not all projects require planning approval, IFI does not adjudicate on planning issues which are in the remit of Local Authorities. IFI work with planning authorities and facilitate pre-planning meetings to assist project applicants.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;500,000 was approved under NSAD during 2017. In 2018 funding of &euro;2.2 million was approved for delivery of 114 development projects across 23 counties nationwide. This round of funding covered capital infrastructure works. </p>  <p>  IFI have ensured support for the implementation of the projects under the strategy. Given the large number of stakeholders, collaboration and partnership is encouraged to ensure the objectives of the NSAD are achieved, particularly the protection and conservation of the resource through stewardship and environmental compliance.</p></reply>

The existing framework for telecommunications relates solely to voice telephony and Functional Internet Access (28.8 kilobits per second). There is no provision in European or national regulation for a USO in relation to mobile voice services. </p>  <p>  The Directive Establishing a European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972), which will come into force following transposition in late 2020, aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks, and contains a provision that would allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, in specific circumstances, where such networks are available.</p>  <p>  Mobile operators are, however, rolling out 3G and 4G networks across Ireland following ComReg&rsquo;s 2012 Multiband Spectrum auction, with at least one operator now having over 90% population coverage of 4G services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the EU Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy highlights the importance of the 694-790MHz (700MHz) spectrum band for ensuring the provision of broadband services in rural areas. The band is particularly attractive for wireless broadband services, allowing higher speeds and greater coverage over long distances. An EU level Decision has been adopted in order to co-ordinate release of the band in all Member States by 30 June 2020. This proposal will allow mobile broadband services to use this part of the spectrum band, which will provide enhanced mobile services. My Department and ComReg have been working to ensure the necessary measures are taken to facilitate a clearance of the spectrum to meet the 2020 timeline for clearing broadcasting services from the band. In addition, ComReg published a preliminary consultation in June 2018 on a proposed award of spectrum rights of use covering multi- band spectrum, to include the 700 MHz band. </p>  <p>  In terms of ongoing efforts to improve mobile telephony coverage nationally, the Programme for Government specifically included a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. The Taskforce which is led by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, containing 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits. An Implementation Group is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. The Implementation Group meets on a quarterly basis and publishes quarterly progress reports on the implementation status of actions.</p>  <p>  Various initiatives are underway under the aegis of the Taskforce, in order to address mobile coverage blackspots:</p>  <p>  -  My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p>  <p>  -  Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify issues relating to mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. </p>  <p>  -  A focus group was established to provide guidance on categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in working to reduce blackspots. It will also inform future policy with regard to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  -  A working group has been established to investigate the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them. </p>  <p>  - ComReg has developed a licensing scheme enabling households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  On foot of feedback received from a wide variety of Stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum 2018, a suite of new Taskforce actions is currently being developed in ongoing discussions with potential action holders for 2019.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas such as counties Cavan and Monaghan.</p></reply>

Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) provides a project management office, project officers, online guidance, workshops and meetings to support applications under the NSAD. In addition a panel of appropriately qualified consultants has been formed to provide advice on the design and installation of instream and riparian fisheries enhancement works.  IFI and the Office of Public Works (OPW) Flood Risk Management Unit signed a shared service agreement in July 2018, which will see continued collaboration over the next five years in the protection of fishery requirements while carrying out flood risk management investment activities.

Local authorities are responsible for maintenance and upgrade of their housing stock and my Department therefore does not keep a record of these upgrades. Government funding of approximately &euro;116 million has been provided by the Department of Housing, Planning &amp;amp; Local Government, from 2013 to the end of 2017 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in almost 64,000 local authority homes. This was Phase 1 of the social housing retrofit programme and focused on the lower-cost improvements such as cavity wall and attic insulation. In addition, energy efficiency measures have been carried out in over 9,000 vacant houses that have been returned to use since 2014. This effectively means that approximately 50% of the social housing stock has already undergone a level of energy retrofit. Phase 2 will commence shortly and will target higher-cost and higher impact measures such as external insulation and replacement of single-glazed windows. Approximately 30% of the social housing stock, or 40,000 homes are more than 40 years old and will be the main priority for phase 2. The ambition is to achieve a BER B standard for these homes. The timeline will be determined by the funding available over the coming years.</p></reply>

This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p>  <p>  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. When this Government came into office, this had risen to 52%. Today, 74% of premises can access high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 85,307 premises in County Meath. Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high speed broadband in Meath has increased by 31,564, a 36% increase. In total, the number of premises in Meath with access to high speed broadband is now 62,934, or 74% of the total number of premises in the county. Approximately another 2,468 premises will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment. </p>  <p>  The remaining 19,905 homes, schools and businesses in Meath will be connected under the Government&rsquo;s NBP State Intervention. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at www.broadband.gov.ie. This Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address or Eircode. </p>  <p>  The specific premises referred to by the Deputy is in the AMBER area on the Map. The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. This intervention is the subject of an ongoing procurement process. </p>  <p>  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. My priority is to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible and I will bring a recommendation to Government in this regard in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements. </p></reply>

The vast majority of sinkholes are natural occurrences formed from the dissolution and erosion of soluble bedrock, such as limestone and gypsum units. Until sinkholes reach the near surface, they are very difficult to identify, let alone monitor. Features, resembling sinkholes, may occasionally develop above shallow underground mine workings. These features are specifically referred to as crown holes.  The majority of abandoned mines in Ireland are not the legal responsibility of the State. As a result, the State does not undertake monitoring at these sites. At all current underground mining operations and recently-closed underground mines, subsidence monitoring is undertaken by the licensee or former mining operator. The results of monitoring at current mines and some closed mines are normally reviewed on a biannual basis by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. However, detailed subsidence monitoring provides no certainty that potential crown hole development will be identified. Crown holes, like sinkholes, are difficult to identify until the cavity breaks the surface.</p>  <p>  Mining subsidence events, including crown holes, have recently occurred at the Drumgoosat gypsum mine in Co. Monaghan, which closed in 1989. Monitoring of this site, including subsidence monitoring, has been occurring since the 1980s. The three relevant authorities, Monaghan County Council, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, are working together to ensure that the company carries out the necessary investigations to understand the development of the recent subsidence events and that all appropriate actions are taken to ensure the health and safety of the local community.</p></reply>

While enforcement action in this area is a matter in the first instance for local authorities, my Department encourages a multi-facetted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education and, as such, provides funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities of approximately &euro;1 million per annum and of the network of local authority waste enforcement officers of approximately &euro;7.4 million per annum. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has developed the Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. Since 2017 funding of &euro;3.3 million has been made available from the Environment Fund in this regard which has supported over 400 projects across all 31 local authority areas, remediating black spots and equipping local authority enforcement officers with the latest technologies available to support SMART enforcement of our waste laws.</p>  <p>  A review of this initiative is underway which will inform a 2019 anti-dumping work programme that will place an increased emphasis on all actors who facilitate the unauthorised movement and disposal of waste.</p></reply>

This is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. The Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/Eircode:  There are 106 premises in the townland of Glencullen. 34 (32%) fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention, while 72 (68%) premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be served by commercial providers. Information on categories of specific premises can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, by entering the relevant Eircode/address into the High Speed Broadband Map.</p><p>The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. My priority is to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible and I will bring a recommendation to Government in this regard in the coming weeks.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements. </p></reply>

Driving without motor insurance is an offence under the Road Traffic Laws.  Enforcement of Road Traffic legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Garda Mobility Strategy aims to provide frontline members with greater connectivity to back-office systems, harnessing the power of mobile technology, and forms part of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021. A pilot programme was operated in Limerick Garda Division from December 2017 to September 2018, with very positive feedback. A key application developed for the Mobility pilot was a Traffic App, which allowed users to search for vehicle information by entering a vehicle registration number into the mobile phone. The trial app gathered information recorded on PULSE in respect of the vehicle, including tax status, ownership information and vehicle warnings, and will when operational be able to tell the Garda at the roadside whether the vehicle is insured. </p>  <p>  The utilisation of mobile devices will enable Garda members to be more efficient and effective by having mobile access to relevant core policing applications, a wide-range of up-to-date information and the ability to input and update information in real time.  As such it should greatly enhance Garda ability to enforce a variety of Road Traffic laws, including those against driving without insurance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-15a.2376.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019011500100#WRSS05200"><p>The number of used cars imported into Ireland has grown significantly in recent years. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, EU legislation permits the free movement of goods (including new and used cars) between Member States, allowing European citizens greater consumer choice. Manufacturing standards for vehicles are also set at EU level and enforced on an EU-wide basis, meaning that similar rules apply to all vehicles used within the EU, regardless of their origin.</p>  <p>  Over the past decade, the diesel-fuelled segment of Ireland's national vehicle fleet has grown.  Among the traditional fuels for transport, diesel is more carbon-efficient than petrol as a means of fuelling vehicles, however, diesel is also associated with worsened air quality, which is concerning particularly in urban areas.</p>  <p>  Therefore, a range of incentives are now in place - many of them introduced by this Government - to encourage consumers to transition from conventionally-fuelled higher-emitting petrol and diesel vehicles towards lower-emitting alternatively-fuelled vehicles.</p>  <p>  A Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Taskforce was established in 2016.  It's first phase of work was on electricity as an alternative-fuel for transport, and the Taskforce's recommendations to Government ahead of Budgets 2018 and 2019 have resulted in a comprehensive suite of measures to incentivise the move to electric vehicles (EVs). The generous incentives on offer include:</p>  <p>   - various grants such as the Purchase Grant Scheme, the Reduced Tolling Scheme and the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle Grant Scheme;</p>  <p>   - tax incentives such as lower motor tax and VRT relief;</p>  <p>   - commercial incentives such as a 0% Benefit-in-Kind rate and an Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme for EVs and their related infrastructure.</p>  <p>  These incentives are having results, with more than double the number of EVs on Irish roads by the end of 2018 than a year previously. The LEV Taskforce has now moved to a second phase of work looking beyond electricity at other alternative fuels and also looking at heavy duty vehicles (HDVs) with a view to continuing the move away from traditional fossil fuels such as diesel.</p>  <p>  The manufacturing and efficiency standards for vehicles that are set at European level also play an important role in spurring industry to produce vehicles that are less emitting and more efficient.  Working at EU level, Ireland continues to push strongly for better vehicle standards, seeking greater ambition in the various EU-wide regulations that ensure vehicles registered with the Union are increasingly more efficient and less emitting.  It is through better technology and improved efficiency that carbon emissions generated by vehicles can be decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will also recall that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced in Budget 2019 that from 1 January 2019 a new 1% surcharge on VRT will be levied on all diesel cars that are newly-registered in the State; this will apply whether the newly-registered car is new or was previously used outside of the State.</p></reply>

The IMA has many roles in relation to maritime safety both of a preventative and a reactive nature.  For instance, the Marine Survey Office carries out maritime transport regulation for ships, seafarers, ports and cargos for safety, security, pollution prevention, accessibility and living and working conditions (for Irish ships in Ireland or worldwide and for foreign ships in Irish ports).  The Irish Coast Guard is responsible for the response to, and coordination of, maritime accidents which require Search &amp;amp; Rescue and Counter Pollution &amp;amp; Ship Casualty operations while also having a role in marine communication, surveillance and emergency management in Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>  <p>  Maritime activity is a multi-faceted area with a wide variety of activities ranging from recreational craft users through to the smaller passenger boats and fishing vessels and on up to larger passenger ships and fishing vessels and internationally trading ships, both passenger and cargo.</p>  <p>  Ensuring safe maritime operations and, in the unfortunate instances where things go wrong, an efficient and effective emergency response, is the top priority within the IMA.  While these activities are constantly under review as part of the day to day work of the IMA, it is useful to take a step back and conduct a separate review from time to time or as the circumstances require.</p>  <p>  For instance, following the tragic incidents involving the Irish Coast Guard RIB off Kilkee in 2016 and, separately, Rescue 116 in 2017, I have instigated a review into the national Search &amp;amp; Rescue Framework whose work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Prior to this, in April 2015 my Department, following a wide consultation, published the Maritime Safety Strategy 2015-2019 which contains a list of actions the IMA is working on implementing.</p></reply>

The Office of the Chief State Solicitor acts on behalf of the Department to ensure that all legal requirements are completed.</p>  <p>  In order for the Department to issue formal approval and allow for the subsequent payment to the club referred to by the Deputy, the Chief State Solicitor's Office must confirm that the legal formalities are complete.

Accordingly, no capital funding from the Regional Airports Programme (RAP) has been provided to the airport since that time and grant aid towards operational expenses ceased from 2017.  In December 2016, I advised the airport that it would be untenable for my Department to continue to disburse taxpayers&rsquo; money to an airport where no scheduled passenger services were operating.  As a result of the foregoing, Waterford Airport advised the Department of its challenging financial state in December 2017. </p>  <p>  On foot of requests made by the airport, and to ensure that there would be no disruption to the Coast Guard&rsquo;s Search and Rescue (SAR) service, I sanctioned the provision of &euro;750,000 in grant funding to the airport last year.  Two payments of &euro;375,000 were made to the airport in January and December.  These were exceptional measures and were provided to allow time for appropriate consideration of the issues arising at Waterford Airport. </p>  <p>  In light of the situation outlined, my Department procured the services of independent consultants, Ernst &amp;amp; Young (EY) to advise on the future options for the airport.  As part of this review, EY have considered the application submitted by the airport to extend its runway, which included a request for Exchequer support.</p>  <p>  In early October 2018, at a meeting of Government, I updated my Cabinet colleagues on the process to consider future options for Waterford Airport. Following that meeting, a copy of the review was provided to the airport and it is my intention, upon receipt and consideration of any views received from the airport by my Department, to bring proposals on the matter to Government.</p></reply>

As part of its business at that port in 2018, Irish Ferries ran three weekly sailings to France (Cherbourg or Roscoff) between April to October, but in December the company announced that it is unlikely to have a ferry service from Rosslare to France in 2019.  The company has indicated that its service between Dublin Port and Cherbourg best serves its customers' needs, and it has stated that its investment of &euro;150m on a new ship to provide ferry services between Ireland and France will significantly increase its year-round freight capacity between the two countries and increase the company&rsquo;s summer tourism capacity by 20%.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that decisions by ferry operators &ndash; including Irish Ferries &ndash; in relation to their provision, alteration or suspension of services are operating and commercial decisions of these private companies, subject to any appropriate regulatory frameworks.</p>  <p>  Within this overall context, I met the CEO of Irish Ferries earlier this month and discussed the company&rsquo;s announced decision.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asks about Rosslare Europort.  As he is aware, the port is owned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and operated and managed as a division of that company which is a commercial State body.  As Minister, I am not involved in the management or operations.</p>  <p>  Iarn&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has recently completed a detailed report on the development potential of Rosslare and a &euro;15 million plan to transform Rosslare Europort has been approved by the board of Irish Rail.  Investment in the port is a matter for the company and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is currently examining how it will raise the capital necessary for planned investment.  As the Deputy will be aware from previous questions, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department late last year on the company's plans for strategic development of the port over the coming years.</p>  <p>  Separately, I recognise that Brexit will have implications for a number of key ports and airports, and Rosslare continues to work closely with my Department and a range of other relevant Government Departments and Offices in preparing for the additional border controls that will arise from Brexit.  In this context, my Department has met Rosslare Port management on a number of occasions over the past year, most recently yesterday, about the infrastructure requirements of the Port in connection with Brexit.  My Department has also been meeting ferry and shipping companies regarding their plans for dealing with the challenges of Brexit, including meeting with Irish Ferries last week.</p></reply>

This Regulation lays down detailed standards for all aspects of the design and operation of drones, and the first set of implementing rules for the operation of drones is currently being developed.</p>  <p>  Until these new pan-European rules enter into force, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) will continue to apply the existing national regulatory requirements in accordance with S.I. 563 of 2015 for the registration and operation of drones. </p>  <p>  Ireland is to the forefront in regulating drone use and was one of the first States globally to require the registration of drones in 2015. Ireland remains one of only a small number of EU States that currently has a drone registration system in place.</p>  <p>  Currently, all drones operating in the State with a mass of 1 kg or greater are required to be registered via a portal on the IAA Website. Registration is also required for drones with a mass of less than 1 kg, where the operator wishes to fly at or above 15 metres above the ground (or water). When a drone is registered, there are restrictions where it may be flown and it is limited to an operating height of 120 metres above the ground (or water), unless specifically permitted by the  IAA.</p>  <p>  S.I. 563 of 2015 sets the requirements for drone operations in the vicinity of aerodromes.  For aerodromes within controlled airspace, such as Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Ireland West at Knock, S.I. 563 of 2015 prohibits the operation of drones except as permitted by the IAA. </p>  <p>  For aerodromes in uncontrolled airspace, such as Kilkenny, Abbeyshrule and Birr, a drone may not be operated within 5 km of an aerodrome during periods of aircraft operations, unless the aerodrome operator or the IAA has given permission.</p>  <p>  Currently the IAA has prescribed two methods for permitting the operation of drones within controlled airspace.</p>  <p>  - Aeronautical Notice U 02 &ndash;  provides for a permission to be obtained from the IAA for drone operations within controlled airspace, under strict conditions. This specific operating permission can provide for managed drone operations in close proximity to an aerodrome, and will only be issued to IAA approved drone operator organisations.</p>  <p>  - Aeronautical Notice U 04, which permits the operation of registered drones, from surface to 50 feet above ground level, without a specific operating permission in certain areas within controlled airspace. These areas are depicted in the Notice and are outside the vicinity of aerodromes by a minimum of 3000 metres. The no fly zones associated with these aerodromes vary in dimension. The extent of these dimensions have been derived using a risk based approach coupled with ICAO Annex 14 aeronautical surface penetration calculation criteria.</p></reply>

While other behavioural change programmes, such as Green Schools and Workplace and Campus Smarter Travel, will continue to be funded in line with commitments. </p><p>Furthermore my Department is in constant communication with the Road Safety Authority (RSA) about matters of safety. The RSA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cycle Smart, Cycle Safe&rsquo; campaign directly addressed safety issues for cyclists, while a recent TV led campaign calls on motorists to keep a safe distance when overtaking cyclists on urban and rural roads.</p><p>In the area of legislation, I have brought through a number of proposals such as the Road Safety Act 2016 which allows for 20 km/h speed limits to be set by local authorities in residential areas. My Department is proposing to build on the existing legislation in relation to dangerous overtaking which will, in particular, specifically target those drivers who put cyclists at risk.</p><p>I believe that the measures and the multi-annual capital expenditure programmes outlined above will positively assist with the better development and provision of cycling infrastructure across the State while improving the safety for all road users. </p></reply>

However, when the UK leaves the EU, there is concern that the additional customs, agriculture and health controls required for trade with a third country could significantly disrupt our transport connectivity to the UK, and via the UK, to our international markets.</p><p>The main pinch-points likely to affect Irish businesses are at Dublin and Rosslare ports, the Port of Holyhead, and the Dover-Calais link. This latter route is favoured by many importers and exporters seeking to transport goods that are perishable or time sensitive<i></i>on the quickest and most reliable route available. Currently, OPW and other relevant Departments are working to establish the required controls at Dublin port, Rosslare port and Dublin Airport for both a central case and a no-deal scenario.</p><p>A major concern is also the impact on the Dover &ndash; Calais link. Congestion on this link could considerably disrupt the &euro;21 billion of Irish trade that crosses the UK landbridge and could mean that certain of our goods simply can no longer realistically reach their markets in a timely manner.</p><p>The Government's contingency action plan published in 2019 sets out the actions being taken within our ports, with the European Commission and with other similarly affected Member States.

Cork County Council&rsquo;s application for funding for the scheme under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund was successful and &euro;750,000 has been allocated to the scheme in 2019 under that Fund.</p><p>As regards the R157, the R162 Navan to Kingscourt the Carlow Southern Link Road and the Thurles Relief Road these projects were mentioned in the National Development Plan as examples of projects which would be the subject of appraisal.A safety scheme on the R157 Castlefarm/Grange, Maynooth road has been implemented in 2018 and my Department is continuing to liaise with the relevant local authorities in relation to appraisal requirements in relation to these and other schemes.</p></reply>

At all times there should be representation from a coastal search, a boat and a cliff unit. The CUAG meets regularly with the national Volunteers Manager and annually with the IRCG Director. Additional meetings can be called by CUAG or management as necessary. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, there are a variety of other avenues through which volunteers raise concerns and advocate their views on issues. These include regular "Sector meetings" in which the IRCG's Coastal Unit Sector Manager for the particular area facilitates an open forum for the volunteers to raise issues. There are also Technical Advisory Committees (TAC&rsquo;s) with volunteer representation to adviceIRCG management on various technical matters such as personal protective equipment.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, IRCG also plan to meet with the units on a national basis 3 times a year which, coupled with the sector meetings, will provide additional opportunities for interaction and communication with Coast Guard management.</p></reply>

This Regulation lays down detailed standards for all aspects of the design and operation of drones and the first set of implementing rules for the operation of drones are currently being developed. Until these new pan-European rules enter into force, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) will continue to apply the existing national regulatory requirements in accordance with S.I. 563 of 2015 for registration and operation of drones.</p>  <p>  Ireland is to the forefront in regulating drone use and was one of the first States globally to require the registration of drones in 2015. Ireland remains one of only a small number of EU States that currently have a drone registration system in place. </p>  <p>  Currently all drones operating in the State with a mass of 1 kg or greater are required to be registered via a portal on the IAA website. Registration is also required for drones with a mass of less than 1 kg, where the operator wishes to fly at or above 15 metres above the ground (or water). When a drone is registered, there are restrictions where it may be flown and it is limited to an operating height of 120 metres above the ground (or water), unless specifically permitted by IAA. </p>  <p>  For aerodromes within controlled airspace, such as Shannon Airport, S.I. No. 563 of 2015 prohibits the operation of drones except as permitted by the IAA. </p>  <p>  Currently the IAA has prescribed two methods for permitting the operation of drones within controlled airspace -</p>  <p>  - Aeronautical Notice U 02 &ndash;  provides for a permission to be obtained from the IAA for drone operations within controlled airspace, under strict conditions. This specific operating permission can provide for managed drone operations in close proximity to an aerodrome, and will only be issued to IAA approved drone operator organisations.  </p>  <p>  - Aeronautical Notice U 04, which permits the operation of registered drones, from surface to 50 feet above ground level, without a specific operating permission in certain areas within controlled airspace. These areas are depicted in the Notice and are outside the vicinity of aerodromes by a minimum of 3000 metres. The no fly zones can vary in dimension. The extent of these dimensions have been derived using a risk based approach coupled with ICAO Annex 14 aeronautical surface penetration calculation criteria.</p>  <p>  There has been no report of drone activity at Shannon Airport to date.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-15a.2560.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019011500104#WRWW00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 953 and 954 together.</p><p>Transport has a critical yet challenging role to play in the national carbon reduction effort.  It is a sector where fossil fuel use is firmly embedded and travel demand is growing significantly due to our economic recovery and growing population.  Despite this demand growth, 2017 saw a very welcome fall in transport emissions for the first time in four years.  Nevertheless, emission savings from technological advancements in improving vehicle efficiencies and new lower carbon fuels are being offset by strong growth in transport demand.  Funding under the Carbon Reduction Programme has an important role to play in this mitigation effort, but it is only one element of a wider range of transport measures that are currently underway, including: developing a range of incentives to encourage a transition away from conventional fuels towards lower emitting alternatives, such as EVs; increasing the proportion of biofuels in fuel mix; improving efficiency standards for all EU vehicles; and of course the significantly enhanced funding I am making available to support the development of new and improved public and sustainable transport infrastructure. </p><p>The National Development Plan outlines the &euro;8.6 billion that will be invested in a range of projects such as:</p><p>- Maintenance and renewal of the heavy rail network; </p><p>- Improving PSO bus services and bus infrastructure in all major cities as part of the BusConnects programme;</p><p>- Electrifying the GDA commuter rail network and expanding services through the DART Expansion programme;</p><p>- Development of a new 26 kilometre metro service in Dublin under the MetroLink project;</p><p>- Enhanced LocalLink services in more rural areas; and </p><p>- An unprecedented level of investment in cycling and walking infrastructure across the State.</p><p>The investment planned under these various programmes will collectively enhance sustainable transport options for citizens across the State and encourage modal shift away from the private car. In 2018 alone approximately 19 million<i></i>more journeys were taken on PSO-funded Public Transport nationally than in 2017, a rise of 7.5%.  The Canal Cordon Count shows that the proportion of commuters who use public transport, cycling or walking to come into Dublin City during peak times has risen to approximately 70% (up from 59% in 2010).  Modal shift is gathering momentum and the trend away from private car use is playing a key role in our mitigation response.</p><p>The Carbon Reduction Programme budget is intended for measures that are new, innovative and often associated with emerging technologies and research.  Because such projects tend to take more time to develop, establish and gain acceptance, the programme used only &euro;697,300 in 2018 as:</p><p>- Production delays deferred the delivery of nine hybrid buses until 2019;</p><p>- Procurement delays in facilitating a small scale pilot programme for alternatively fuelled rural buses.  These costs will now arise in 2019 instead;</p><p>- Assessment of vehicle suitability by taxi drivers and the NTA meant that, as is often the case with the introduction of new grants, the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) grant payment rate early in the year was slow; however, the application rate increased as 2018 progressed and this improvement is expected to continue into 2019 as the Scheme becomes established in the sector; and finally</p><p>- For the EV Reduced Tolling Scheme cost drawdown only arises for four months of operation.  Scheme invoices for November and December will not arise for payment until Q1 2019.</p><p>Considering the increased take-up and spend on the various schemes and projects in the later months of 2018, I expect a higher spend from the Carbon Reduction Programme in 2019 and I was delighted to be able to allocate &euro;7 million in 2019 which will support five key areas:</p><p>1. Low Emission Bus Trials: The National Development Plan committed that from July 2019, no more diesel-only buses would be purchased for the urban bus fleet.  In late 2018, my Department, together with the National Transport Authority and key urban operators, launched a comprehensive set of bus trials with the objective of helping to further inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years. The fuels and technologies to be tested include full electric, diesel-electric hybrids, hydrogen and compressed natural gas. The trials will assess CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, impacts on air quality and the contribution potential towards sectoral renewable energy targets, as well as costs, vehicle availability and operational/infrastructural requirements.  The trials are ongoing in Dublin and Cork, and it is expected that they will end in April 2019. </p><p>2. Electric Vehicle Reduced Tolling Scheme: The Electric Vehicle Reduced Tolling Scheme, launched in July 2018, allows drivers of EVs to apply for a discount in toll fares.  Battery electric vehicles (BEV) are eligible for a 50% toll discount and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) are eligible for a 25% discount up to a maximum value of &euro;500, with higher levels of discount available across certain toll roads during off-peak journeys.</p><p>3. Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) Grant Scheme: The Electric SPSV Grant Scheme was launched in April 2018 and supports drivers in the taxi, hackney and limousine sector who wish to transition to an electric vehicle.  Under this scheme, up to &euro;7,000 or &euro;3,500 towards the purchase of a BEV or PHEV respectively can be granted to a successful applicant. </p><p>4. Cost differential for purchasing low-emission vehicles for the public transport sector: Funding under the Carbon Reduction Programme is also available to support projects undertaken by PSO operators to support the transition towards deployment of low carbon technologies in public transport.  It may be used to cover the price differential between a conventionally fuelled vehicle and an alternatively fuelled vehicle.</p><p>5. Research: Mitigation measures for transport emissions are constantly under review in a rapidly developing and technologically evolving sector, and new and innovative measures are always being considered.  In support of evidence building DTTAS co-funds transport and climate research, with four projects currently underway (three with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and one with the Environmental Protection Agency) examining subjects such as behavioural change and the decarbonisation of the freight sector.</p></reply>

These changes involve two measures.  The first is a provision to hold accountable owners of vehicles who allow unaccompanied learners to drive their vehicles.  The second extends the existing Garda power to detain vehicles in certain circumstances by adding the circumstance where the driver is an unaccompanied learner.</p>  <p>  I do not see how either of these should negatively affect the cost of motor insurance.  It is already a criminal offence for a learner to drive unaccompanied, and has been since 2007.  The new measures in question are intended to increase Garda enforcement powers in this area and act as a deterrent to the highly dangerous practice of learners driving unaccompanied.  As such, the new measures should make our roads safer.  </p></reply>

The Rules of the Road, a document with which every driver should be very familiar, clearly state that there is no reliable way to tell how much any given individual can drink before exceeding the legal limit as it varies depending on the specific circumstances as well individual biochemistry.  This point has been repeatedly underlined by scientific experts in the field.  In light of this, there are no concrete "facts" to be publicly circulated about how it long it takes to process a standard drink, and it would be unhelpful and misleading of my Department or any arm of Government to attempt to do so.  I am aware that drinkaware.ie, which is a national not-for-profit organisation funded by voluntary donations from supporters including producers and distributors of alcohol, does attempt to provide some guidance on this topic.</p>  <p>  My Department, the Road Safety Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety share a very clear position on this matter: the only guaranteed way to stay safely below the drink driving limit is to never ever drink and drive.</p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to a specific company, which is licensed as a dispatch operator in Ireland and which, in other countries, provides a ridesharing service. As you know, the National Transport Authority (NTA) as Regulator of the small public service vehicle sector has regulatory oversight of the sector, including the licensing of vehicles and drivers. The current regulatory regime is in place to protect the consumer and to help ensure personal safety.

Early Learning and Care practitioners play a critical role in supporting young children's early learning and development and providing a safe and caring environment. They deserve to be recognised, valued and respected for this.</p>  <p>  While my Department funds a wide range of initiatives to support the quality, affordability and accessibility of early learning and care services, the State is not the employer of staff in this sector and cannot set wage levels. The large majority of Early Learning and Care settings are private businesses (74% according to the most recent figures from Pobal), with the remainder being independent community-based organisations (26%).This is an entirely different context to the situation regarding primary and post-primary educators. Given this context, there are limits to the actions my Department can take. </p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the Early Learning and Care sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels.  As the Deputy will be aware, neither I nor my officials can initiate a Sectoral Employment Order, but my Department will readily co-operate with such a process, if and when it is underway.</p>  <p>  I have also supported a range of measures to improve pay and conditions using the tools available to me. In particular, DCYA has introduced additional capitation into funding programmes for early learning and care, including a 7% rise this September in the ECCE capitation rate, as well as Programme Support Payments to recognise the administrative roles that services play. I have also continued to provide a higher rate of capitation payment for graduate-led pre-school rooms, to encourage the attraction and retention of Early Learning and Care graduates. Last year I also introduced a pilot measure for funding services whose staff take part in continuing professional development, and I hope to build on this pilot over the years to come, following an evaluation.</p>  <p>  I have encouraged services to use such additional funding to support the pay and conditions of the hard-working frontline staff that make such a lasting difference to children's lives. I was pleased to see that the most recent annual sector profile published by Pobal showed an increase in the average wage in the sector from &euro;11.93 per hour in 2017 to &euro;12.17 in 2018, but I acknowledge that there is a long way to go before staff have the wages and working conditions that reflect the importance of the work they do.</p>  <p>  My Department has also commissioned an Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Quality Childcare, which is examining the factors that impact on the cost of delivering quality childcare, including staff wages. When complete, this will inform policy development and funding decisions. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of First Five, in which the Government committed to move to a graduate-led Early Learning and Care workforce by 2028, work will commence shortly on developing a Workforce Plan to achieve this commitment.</p></reply>

The information that an illegal birth registration has taken place is potentially life changing and the State has a responsibility to reach a high level of certainty that this has in fact happened before it contacts the individuals concerned. I am keeping the situation continuously under review. </p>  <p>  Further to this, the Deputy will also be aware that I initiated a review of adoption records to determine if similar evidence of illegal registration could be identified from the records of other former adoption agencies and other relevant bodies as was identified in the St. Patrick's Guild files. It is not possible at this stage to anticipate the type of information that will emerge from the review. Given the sensitive personal data contained in the files, data protection and GDPR issues have arisen, which have delayed the review, but these have now been addressed and the final report of the review is expected to be submitted to me before Easter 2019.</p>  <p>  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 is relevant to those affected by illegal registration and I am committed to bringing it to Committee Stage in the Seanad as soon as possible. People affected by illegal registration will be able to apply for an information and tracing service on the same basis as adoptees.</p>  <p>  This is an important piece of legislation as it provides adopted people and other relevant people with statutory rights to information and to a tracing service. It will also protect relevant records by bringing them into the custody of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and it will create offences for the concealment, destruction, mutilation or falsification of such records. </p>  <p>  However, there is a constitutional context and the Bill must seek to balance the rights to identity and to privacy, which sometimes compete with one another. However, the Bill operates on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible.</p></reply>

It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. AIM supports children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-school where they can learn and socialise with their peers. AIM is a child-centred model, involving 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.</p>  <p>  An application was made on behalf of the child in question for AIM Level 5 support. AIM Level 5 provides for access to specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations capital grants for early learning and care settings where such equipment is critical to ensuring that a child with a disability can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme. </p>  <p>  Equipment that is also for use outside the pre-school setting and that can be transported from home to the pre-school is not eligible for funding through AIM.  Items such as the weighted blanket and weighted lap pad, requested on behalf of this child, fall into this category.  Requests for such items should be made through the HSE by the child's therapist, for use by the child both in the home and outside the home.</p>  <p>  Pobal has advised me that, while the decision to refuse the equipment in this case was correctly made, there were errors in the wording used in emails issued by them to the child&rsquo;s parents, pre-school service and HSE therapist on 9/11/18 and 20/11/18. These emails incorrectly stated that the equipment was being refused because it was standard play equipment. They should instead have stated that the equipment was being refused because it can be transported from home. Pobal has apologised for these errors and has clarified the position with the relevant parties. There is no basis for a review of this decision as this type of equipment is not eligible for funding through AIM.</p></reply>

Following these discussions Dr, Shannon and I  agreed to the measures outlined in the Action Plan.</p>  <p>   I am pleased to report progress has been made on the recommendations. While many of the recommendations for Tusla are of an ongoing nature, I sought assurance at the start of this process that the issues identified are kept to the fore across child protection assessments and ongoing engagement with vulnerable families.</p>  <p>  The ongoing  implementation of Signs of Safety as the national approach to child protection provides an increased level of analysis and judgement, which will improve consistency in determining appropriate response pathways for children and families, ensuring they receive a proportionate and timely response.</p>  <p>  Joint working between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been enhanced on a number of levels. In relation to Tusla's engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Joint Working Protocol has been operational since Quarter 1, 2018. Work has now commenced on the joint auditing of its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Tusla/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Joint Data Sharing Agreement is expected to be signed off by Tusla's Interim CEO and the Garda Commissioner in Quarter 1, 2019.</p>  <p>  The AGS has established the National Child Protection Unit which is now operational.  In October 2018, Tusla assigned a senior staff member for secondment to this Unit with specific responsibility for the development of a joint working model. A draft Specialist Interviewing Protocol is under consultation, with a target launch date end of February 2019.</p>  <p>  Progress has also been made on developing the out of hours social work service.  A single national out of hours number went live on 3/12/18 and is available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Out of Hours GP services and the Accident and Emergency service. This service provides access to an on-call social worker at regional /area level who can go the  scene of an incident in specific cases of a serious nature.  </p>  <p>  You may also be interested to know that Dr. Shannon's findings on the way Section 12 events were managed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prompted me to request Tusla to commission research into how social workers made decisions when a child came into their custody, following the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. This research was undertaken by NUI Galway and a final report is expected early this year.</p>  <p>  The focus of Dr. Shannon's  audit of the application of Section 12 was An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but the report also identified key areas for improvement in Tusla practice. The Action Plan I agreed with Dr. Shannon addressed these areas. While not all actions are not yet completed, I am confident that the changes that have been put in place  are bringing about lasting  improvements. </p></reply>

At the end of 2017 there were 109 Family Resource Centres (FRCs) in receipt of funding from Tusla. My Department provided Tusla with additional funding of &euro;3.0 m in 2018 to expand the programme with the inclusion of 11 additional centres, bringing the total number of Family Resource Centres to 120. </p>  <p>  The methodology and criteria considered in selecting 11 new FRCs from the list of applicants included the size and make-up of the geographical area; the social and economic conditions of the specified area; and the overall population breakdown of the area that would be serviced by the centre. The criteria also considered the structure of the organisation(s) applying to the Programme; their objectives, targets, and current relationships with other organisations; and the inclusion of available research, community projects, and needs assessments with the application. </p>  <p>  Decisions by Tusla in relation to the funding of individual FRCs have regard to the location, size and catchment area of each centre. The process aims to be equitable and transparent. All decisions are made to ensure that available resources are applied to improving outcomes for children and families nationally in the most efficient, effective, equitable, proportionate and sustainable way.  </p>  <p>  Tusla also considers Area Commissioning Plans, Children and Young People's Service Committee plans, and other available evidence, to ensure that the allocated funding targets those children and families that are most in need. </p>  <p>  It is important that the needs of children and families are met in the best way possible, particularly in areas of disadvantage.

It was designed as a time-bound, co-funding agreement led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in conjunction with The Atlantic Philanthropies (Atlantic), originally in the amount of &euro;29.7m for the period 2013-2017. Additional funding was secured by DCYA to extend the programme in 2018.The ABC Programme is being delivered in 13 areas of disadvantage in Ireland, led by local consortia who co-ordinate the planning and delivery of programmes and services in their area. In each ABC area, a lead agency oversees the programme at a local level.</p>  <p>  The aim of the ABC Programme was to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families in areas of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  A national evaluation of the ABC Programme was undertaken by the Centre for Effective Services (CES). Data was collected locally, at the area-level in order to assess the effectiveness of the totality of the investment with regard to the main outcomes the programme aimed to address: Improved child health and development; Improved children&rsquo;s learning and Improved parenting. The evaluation also looked at the impact of the ABC Programme on local service delivery, and at the costs associated with the delivery of the programme.</p>  <p>  Overall, the national evaluation found evidence that the ABC Programme made a positive contribution to:</p>  <p>  1. Improved outcomes for children and families</p>  <p>  2. Changes for practitioners and service managers participating in the Programme</p>  <p>  3. Changes to service planning and delivery.</p>  <p>  A range of qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed for the purposes of evaluation. These included outcomes data collected from the ABC areas, as well as data from surveys and interviews with practitioners, programme managers and other stakeholders. Given the local nature of data collected, there are currently no plans to publish the data sets.</p>  <p>  The national evaluation was completed in October 2018 and a full report and summary report has been produced and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and the CES website. Local areas will also receive a poster and brochure set giving details of the outcome of the programme in their local area and the overall national findings. </p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure that we take full account of the learning from all the interventions across the 13 ABC sites, and from the national evaluation, in order to inform the delivery of prevention and early intervention initiatives and to achieve our shared goal of improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland.</p></reply>

This is undertaken as part of core social work training, which deals with signs and symptoms of abuse, including child sexual abuse. </p><p>Social workers are trained in the building of relationships, especially with parents and children in times of crisis. Tusla social workers have regular supervision of their cases with a team leader or Principal Social Worker,  are provided with a Child Protection and Welfare practice handbook, and access to an internal hub holding information on child sexual abuse and a range of specialist articles on the subject. </p><p>When concerns of abuse are identified these are assessed and supports provided to families to deal with the issues arising and ensure the child is no longer harmed. In the case of child sexual abuse, allegations can arise directly and a process of ongoing protection, support and therapy is required. Social workers will provide guidance and referral to specialist services as required. In other cases, where the initial concern is  of neglect or other abuse, children may  subsequently make disclosures of sexual abuse when they trust the adults looking after them. </p><p>I am advised by Tusla that specialist training in sexual abuse is organised on the basis of client need and social work role, and that many social workers who have developed an expertise in this area are working throughout the service. </p><p>Access to specialist social work, psychological and child psychiatric consultation is also available through dedicated services such as St. Clare's and St. Louise's based in Temple Street Children's Hospital and Crumlin Children's Hospital. </p><p>The development of specialist social work services has changed over the past number of years, with a move from verification of allegations to the provision of support and therapy. Where an allegation of sexual abuse is made, social workers notify An Garda S&iacute;ochana (AGS)  and strategy meetings, as set out in Children First, form an important link in the investigation of a potential crime by AGS  and an assessment of a child's need for protection and support by Tusla.</p><p>I have been informed that at present, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has 12 trained Specialist Interviewers to join with a the AGS when they are interviewing a child forensic purposes with a view to undertaking a criminal prosecution. </p><p>Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have agreed a joint approach to managing and coordinating joint training in child protection. The approach involves the establishment of a Joint Training Oversight Committee, involving members of the Joint Working Project Team, Tusla Workforce Learning Development and Templemore Garda College. </p><p>Tusla is also working in partnership with An Garda Siochana to review the  training for social workers of Specialist Interviewers to conduct interviews under the Joint Specialist Interview process under Section 16(1)(b) of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992. This is to ensure that information obtained during the interview will be available to be used subsequently to formulate safety and protection plans and formulate therapeutic interventions.</p><p>I have also established an interdepartmental group to put in place arrangements for cross-agency centres to support children and families who have suffered from child sexual abuse.</p><p>&lsquo;One House'  centres are intended to provide services for children and adolescents where there is a concern that sexual abuse may have occurred.  The intention is that the centres will support children who have suffered sexual abuse  while accessing care or health services, and engaging with the criminal justice system.  The 'One House'  will bring together the forensic, protection, health, therapeutic and policing services in a child centred way in order to  minimise as far as possible any additional trauma for the child and their family.  The centres should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of child sexual abuse services and develop specialist expertise, skills and knowledge in this complex area for the benefit of children who have suffered from sexual abuse.</p></reply>

In 2018, a nationwide media campaign seeking expressions of interest in a Collaborative Forum of former residents of the Mother and Baby Homes and those with comparable experience in a County Home account for the majority of expenditure. I opened the inaugural meeting of the Collaborative Forum to facilitate dialogue and action on issues of concern to former residents of Mother and Baby Homes on 26 July 2018. The purpose of the Collaborative Forum is to build upon the process of engagement and consultation with former residents commenced through the facilitated meetings in 2017.</p><p>The Deputy might note that my Department does not have a dedicated budget for marketing and media purposes. In the circumstances, it is not possible to identify the projected spend for 2019 as such costs are only incurred when considered necessary and appropriate.</p></reply>

However, the Authority is fully independent in the performance of its statutory functions.  Neither I nor my Department have any role in the decision making process of the Authority.  My Department receives regular updates from the Charities Regulator on key performance indicators, under the terms of an oversight agreement. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Charities Regulator undertakes extensive activities to engage and communicate with its stakeholders, which include charities and the public. During 2018 its website had 118,000 visitors who viewed almost 690,000 pages. It issued 35 press releases, published a number of inspectors&rsquo; reports it commissioned into two charities, and launched of the Charities Governance Code.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Charities Regulator communicates with the public through its social media platforms, with significant increases in the number of followers over the last 12 months.  In 2018 it also commenced publishing an electronic newsletter which was issued four times during the year to approximately 20,000 people for each edition. </p>  <p>  It organised a series of public meetings around the country during the year to address questions from charities and members of the public. In addition, it targeted charity trustees during Charity Trustees Week in November, with public meetings and a national advertising campaign.</p>  <p>  During 2018 it produced and publicised four new guidance documents to assist charities in complying with their obligations under the Charities Act 2009. It also published a report it commissioned from Indecon into the social and economic impact of registered Irish charities. </p>  <p>  The Charities Regulator also produces an annual report which provides detailed accounts of the work undertaken by the Regulator. This is placed in the Oireachtas library and is published on the Regulator&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  However, there are elements of its work which the Charities Regulator does not comment publicly on, as to do so could undermine its ability to perform its functions. These areas include the on-going work of its compliance team and the work of the Charity Services Committee and the cases that are before it. It should be noted, however, that in August 2018, the Charities Regulator published a report on its compliance work for 2017, which included metrics of key compliance actions undertaken and an analysis of the common issues which emerged during the year.</p></reply>

The purpose of the programme is to encourage Local Authorities to support digital development in their areas. Projects must promote, support, or otherwise advance at least one of the pillars outlined in the scheme criteria and must show the potential for public benefit. </p><p>Applications are required to meet certain criteria that include evidence that the project will take an innovative approach, provide a public benefit and meet prescribed draw-down timescales. Applications that satisfy these criteria are deemed to be valid applications and are then assessed by an evaluation panel.</p><p>All Local Authorities were invited to apply for funding under two calls for proposals under the Digital Innovation Programme in 2018.  This resulted in 36 valid applications progressing to evaluation stage, and 21 projects being approved for funding.  In addition, a number of Local Authorities submitted applications that were not deemed valid in the context of the scheme criteria and, as a consequence, did not progress to the evaluation stage.  Details of the valid applications received from each of the Local Authorities who submitted proposals, along with the number of applications approved and the funding awarded, are provided on Table 1 below.</p><p>Since its inception, &euro;700,094 has been awarded under the Digital Innovation Programme.

An Implementation Group was established in 2017 to oversee the delivery of the actions in the Taskforce&rsquo;s report. Progress reports on the delivery of these actions are published on my Department's website on a quarterly basis.</p><p>With regard to the specific issue of mobile phone blackspots, my officials, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, are actively engaged with Local Authorities and mobile phone operators to identify priority blackspots and take action to address this issue. </p><p>During 2017, officials of both Departments worked with a group of Local Authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  Building on this exercise, a call was issued to all Local Authorities in 2018 to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to improve telecommunications services. </p><p>Seventeen of the thirty one Local Authorities have provided data on blackspots. Table 1 below provides details of these seventeen Local Authorities and the number of blackspots they each identified.</p><p>The blackspot information provides indicative data on poor coverage in specific rural areas and along national and regional roads.  However, it should be borne in mind that the number of blackspots changes as new telecommunications infrastructure is rolled out and upgraded.</p><p>The Department will continue to work with the telecommunications providers throughout 2019 to ensure that new infrastructure is targeted to the areas most in need. It should also be noted that the imminent publication of ComReg's national coverage map will give a more accurate reflection of mobile phone coverage throughout the country.</p><p>With regard to funding and support, my Department provided &euro;35,000 to each Local Authority in 2018 to support the appointment of a Broadband Officer. Broadband Officers are tasked with co-ordinating broadband and telecommunications development in their Local Authority areas. Broadband Officer funding increased to &euro;42,000 for 2019. My Department has also assigned liaison officers to support Local Authority Broadband Officers in this and other initiatives. At the implementation stage of the blackspot data collection exercise, a technical information document was provided to every Local Authority to guide them in their work.</p><p>My Department continues to support Local Authorities and communities across Ireland to deal with broadband and mobile phone service deficits.  For example, my Department recently awarded a grant of &euro;35,000 to erect a mobile phone mast in Malin Beg, Co. Donegal under the Digital Innovation Programme.  This project is a partnership between the local community and a telecommunications provider that provides an opportunity to test a solution to mobile phone blackspots in a rural areas.</p><p><b>Table 1 - Local Authorities who provided data on Mobile Phone Blackspots</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Local Authority</th><th>Blackspots</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Carlow</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Donegal</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>3 &amp;amp; 4</td><td>Galway City Council / Galway County Council</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Kerry</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Kildare</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Leitrim</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Limerick</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Longford</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Mayo</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Meath</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Sligo</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Tipperary</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Waterford</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Wicklow</td><td>10</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Following a review, I launched a new scheme which took effect on 1 November 2017.  A media and information campaign was organised to support the launch.  In addition to the provision of the alarm equipment, there were modifications to the qualifying conditions of the scheme, and the first year of monitoring is free to each new participant.</p><p>I am pleased to say that since the launch of the new Seniors Alert Scheme, the demand has been unprecedented. During 2017 over 12,600 applications were approved and more than 10,000 installations completed. During 2018, over 19,200 applications were approved, with 20,288 installations completed.  With the huge increased demand for the scheme and the provision of one year free monitoring, expenditure in 2017 and 2018 exceeded the allocation available for the scheme.  However, in both years savings were identified from other areas within my Department's allocation to ensure that all new applicants could be provided for.  There is also provision under the Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan 2018, which also covers 2019, for funding to meet the additional and exceptional demands of the Scheme.</p><p>As this is a demand led scheme, it is kept under continuous review by officials in my department to ensure adequate funding can be made available to meet the requirements of all qualifying applicants.  I intend that this will also be the case during 2019.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Allocation &euro;,000</th><th>Spend &euro;,000</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>2,350</td><td>1,540</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2,300</td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2,300</td><td>2,683</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>2,300</td><td>6,984</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>2,300</td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The approved measures will support a wide range of projects and programmes relating to issues such as social inclusion, assisting migrants, support for carers, speech and language therapy, support for dementia sufferers and sports measures. The majority of measures will commence in 2019, subject to voted expenditure being available within each relevant Department.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the ways in which individual organisations can apply for funding, it is a matter for each relevant Department as to how they deliver their own measures. For example, my own Department recently granted capital funding to a range of social enterprises that are addressing disadvantage and disability through their work, following a process which was administered by Pobal.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific organisations referred to, I am aware that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport administers Dormant Account measures through Sport Ireland, who periodically invite applications for possible projects and programmes from the National Governing Bodies, Local Sports Partnerships and other agencies directly involved with disadvantage and disability. Through these measures the Department of Transport has recently made Dormant Accounts Funding available to the Irish Wheelchair Association. I am also aware that Acquired Brain Injury Ireland was recently approved for Dormant Accounts Funding of &euro;170,000 through a measure administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. This is to support the set up of a national support network for carers of people with an acquired brain injury.</p></reply>

It enables eligible persons to pursue education and to continue to receive income support, in line with their qualifying scheme rates, for the duration of a course of study.  The objective of the scheme is to raise the educational and skill levels to enable jobseekers better access to the emerging needs of the labour market in line with Government activation strategy.</p>  <p>  The BTEA is not intended as an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third-level education system.  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) Grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing education. The eligibility rules that govern the payment of a student maintenance grant are a matter for that Department.</p>  <p>  The appropriate rate of payment for all social welfare schemes, including the BTEA scheme, is considered by Government in the context of the Budget and the availability of resources.  The rate for BTEA is linked to the persons' underlying payment, for example jobseekers allowance, and my Department will provide a further &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate from March 2019 (building on similar increases in March 2017 and 2018).  This will increase the weekly maximum personal rate from &euro;198 to &euro;203.</p>  <p>  From the 2017/2018 academic year my Department reintroduced the annual Cost of Education Grant. This grant is &euro;500 and is payable to BTEA participants with a child on their BTEA payment.</p>  <p>  Overall, the Deputy should note that some &euro;78.5 million was paid by my Department in 2018 to meet the cost of BTEA and the cost of Education Grant.  This represents a considerable investment in supporting in excess of 10,000 customers in the past year to acquire the necessary education and skills to re-enter the labour market.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

In particular, where the mother is still legally married to a person other than the father of the child, the provisions in section 22(3) apply. In these circumstances the father&rsquo;s name may be registered on foot of:</p>  <p>  - A statutory declaration by the woman&rsquo;s husband that he is not the father of the child, or</p>  <p>  - A statutory declaration by the woman that she has been living apart from her husband during the period of 10 months ending immediately before the birth of the child by virtue of a decree of divorce, a decree of divorce a mensa et thoro, a decree of nullity or a deed of separation.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, it is open to either the mother or father to apply for a Court Order under Section 45 of the Status of Children Act 1987 naming the person other than her husband as the father of the child. Upon receipt of this court order, the birth will be registered with the named person as the father of the child, in accordance with section 22(2)(d).</p>  <p>  Section 6 of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 amends section 22 to make it possible, in certain circumstances, for a person other than the mother&rsquo;s husband to be registered as the father of the child without any of the decrees, deeds or court order mentioned above.  These provisions, however, remain to be commenced pending agreement from the HSE to the delivery of training to staff of the Civil Registration Service, who are employees of the HSE.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department, the GRO, the Department of Health, and the HSE are maintaining their best efforts to ensure that commencement of this legislation can be brought about as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I also intend to bring forward measures in the Civil Registration Bill 2019 that will make it less onerous for a woman in these circumstances to rebut the automatic assumption of paternity of her husband.  This will better align civil registration legislation with current presumption of paternity provisions set out in section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987, following commencement of section 88 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 in early 2016. Implementation of these new measures will also be dependent on training of registrars in the HSE.</p></reply>

It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act by providing for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhancing employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  In July 2018, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill on Committee Stage including provisions relating to defined benefit schemes.</p>  <p>  In developing these provisions, it is essential to be cognisant of the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise.</p>  <p>  Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  However, the provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which, amongst other things, will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing for a 12-month notification period, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit.</p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult in detail with other Government Departments and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of the provisions.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Information letters were issued to all pensioners explaining that my Department will contact them again to either inform them about the outcome of their review or to request further information in order to complete their review.  All of the claims involved will be individually examined, starting with those aged 71 or over.  The process will take a number of months to complete.</p>  <p>  Where possible, my Department will use information already held to assist in these reviews.  For example, a deciding officer will consider awarding HomeCaring Periods where a person&rsquo;s gap in employment coincides directly with a period for which they received a social welfare payment such as Child Benefit (for a child up to age 12) or Carers Allowance or Benefit.  Additional information will be requested in writing from pensioners in relation to unexplained gaps in their social insurance record if required to complete their review.  Information requests will also explain how to access my Department&rsquo;s online service to provide the relevant information.  On receipt of the requested information, the person&rsquo;s state pension (contributory) will be reviewed and they will be informed of the outcome in writing.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the first review outcomes will be notified during Quarter 1 2019.  Regardless of when a review is completed, where a pensioner qualifies for an increase, the increase will be paid with their next due payment and arrears backdated to March 2018, or their 66th birthday if later, will be paid.  If a pensioner does not qualify for an increase, they will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.  No personal pension entitlement rates will be reduced as a result of this review.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Spouses of self-employed contributors are specifically one category excepted from PRSI liability in respect of their working activity with their spouse.  Family members who work together are generally not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Other relatives, such as sons, daughters and grandchildren, are also usually exempted.</p><p>However, depending on the nature of the employment relationship, there are some circumstances where such employments are insurable.  For spouses, there is scope within the provisions of social welfare legislation to enable spouses who are partners in an enterprise, or who work together in a legally incorporated business, to be insurable and to accrue entitlement to certain benefits and pensions.</p><p>Current social welfare legislation reflects the reality that family members regularly support each other without having any intention of entering into formal contractual arrangements.  Employment under a contract of service as an employee or as a contract for services as a self-employed person is, by its very nature and necessity, a formal agreement between two or more parties.  All contracts bring with them rights and responsibilities that, in this instance, include compliance with legislation relating to PRSI, taxes and employment rights.</p><p>Section 12 of the act defines an employed contributor and also excludes those employments listed in Part 2 of Schedule 1 from insurability as it states:</p><p>&quot;Subject to this Act&mdash;</p><p>(a) subject to paragraph (b), every person who, being over the age of 16 years and under pensionable age, is employed in any of the employments specified in Part 1 of Schedule 1, not being an employment specified in Part 2 of that Schedule, shall be an employed contributor for the purposes of this Act&quot;</p><p>The categories of excepted employments are listed in Part 2 of Schedule 1 as:</p><p>1. Employment in the service of the spouse or civil partner of the employed person.</p><p>2. Employment of a casual nature otherwise than for the purposes of the employer&rsquo;s trade or business, and otherwise than for the purposes of any game or recreation where the persons employed are engaged or paid through a club.</p><p>3. Employment by a prescribed relative of the employed person, being either employment in the common home of the employer and the employed person or employment specified by regulations as corresponding to employment in the common home of the employer and the employed person.</p><p>4. Employment specified in regulations as being of such a nature that it is ordinarily adopted as subsidiary employment only and not as the principal means of livelihood.</p><p>5. Employment specified in regulations as being of inconsiderable extent.</p><p>6. Employment under a scheme provided by the Minister and known as Community Employment where that employment began before 6 April 1996.</p><p>7. Employment in the State in a company under a written or an oral contract of service, whether expressed or implied, where the employed person is-</p><p>(a) the beneficial owner of that company, or</p><p>(b) able to control 50 per cent or more of the ordinary share capital of that company, either directly or through the medium of other companies or by any indirect means.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department also offers courses to staff in Suicide Awareness via Safe Talk, Suicide Prevention via Assist along with courses in Personal Resilience.  These courses are available to all staff in the Department, including staff in Intreo Centres.  Since 2013, over 2,900 staff have attended training courses in these areas.  In addition, e-learning courses developed for front line public servants by the National Disability Authority (NDA) and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) are freely available to all staff via the Department&rsquo;s Staff Development Unit&rsquo;s intranet site.  Bespoke, ad hoc training can also be procured where required.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Mental Health Ireland (MHI) and the Civil Service Employee Assistance Service (CSEAS), Mental Health Awareness Workshops have been held in a variety of locations.  These workshops provide tools and strategies to enhance mental health and well-being, increase awareness and understanding and promote the range of formal and informal supports and resources available.</p>  <p>  My Department has a dedicated Disability Liaison Officer to support staff with disabilities along with their managers.  The Officer offers support and promotes awareness of disability issues and services amongst staff while also facilitating the Department&rsquo;s active participation in the Irish Association for Supported Employment&rsquo;s Job Shadow Initiative and AHEAD&rsquo;s Willing Able Mentoring Programme.

These supports include the following: </p><p>- The Employability service, delivered under a contract arrangement in 23 locations around the country on behalf of the Department.  It specialises in providing support to persons with a disability and works with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.  It includes the provision of a dedicated job coach support as well as both pre-employment and in employment supports and assistance.  </p><p>- The Wage Subsidy Scheme, which is targeted at private sector employers and encourages the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of financial incentives.</p><p>- The &lsquo;Ability&rsquo; programme, which provides funding (via Pobal) to 27 organizations being funded to support young people (aged 15-29) with disabilities to move closer to the labour market through the provision of a range of person-centered supports.  The programme will see some 2,600 young people with disabilities being supported over the next three years.</p><p>- A  range of employment support grants for people with disabilities are also provided, under the Reasonable Accommodation Fund.  The fund is a demand-led scheme and is comprised of the Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Personal Reader Grant, the Job Interview Interpreter Grant and the Employee Retention Grant.</p><p>- The Department also funds two AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) programmes compromising the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme and the &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; programme both of which are designed as employment support programmes for graduates  with disabilities. </p><p>- The  Department also provides the Partial Capacity Benefit payment for those with a reduced capacity to work.  </p><p>My Department also operates a number of general schemes which persons with a disability can avail of, namely:</p><p>- The Community Employment (CE) programme enhances employability by providing work experience and training opportunities for people within their communities.  </p><p>- The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) is open to persons in receipt of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension.  This scheme was launched in October 2018.  </p><p>- The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) provides farmers and fishermen with income support while they also make a contribution to their communities.  The scheme is open to people in receipt of Disability Allowance.</p><p>Finally, under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, my Department is progressively developing and improving its Intreo service for people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service on a voluntary basis.  Training has been delivered to over 60 Intreo case officers to provide specialised support to people with disabilities presenting at DEASP Intreo Centres.  The Jobseeker (person with a disability) who seeks support from their local Intreo Centre will have a meeting arranged with a case officer with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan and in order to access the full range of supports available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-15a.2952.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019011500110#WRCCC05200"><p>While both the wage subsidy scheme (WSS) and the  partial capacity benefit (PCB) schemes seek to improve employment outcomes for persons with disabilities,  they operate in different ways and with different qualifying conditions.  In particular, the WSS is a support to employers while the PCB is a support provided to individuals.  </p>  <p>  The partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme is designed for people who are on illness benefit, for at least six months, or on invalidity pension and who have retained some capacity for work and wish to work.  If awarded, PCB will allow them to continue to receive, in addition to their earnings from employment, a percentage of their illness benefit or invalidity pension payment while working.  The personal rate of payment of PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction, regarding their capacity for work, whether the person was in receipt of Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension and their current rate of payment.  After the medical assessment, if a person's disability is rated as moderate, severe or profound their previous payment continues at 50, 75 or 100 per cent, respectively. </p>  <p>  The wage subsidy scheme (WSS) is an employment support which provides financial incentives to private sector employers to employ people with a disability for between 21 and 39 hours employment per week under a minimum 12 month contract of employment.</p>  <p>  The PCB is intended to provide support to a person returning to employment or self-employment and is not intended for those currently in employment which is one of the qualifying conditions of the WSS.  Even if this changed, it is not possible to anticipate how individual PCB medical assessments would apply to persons currently employed, where their employer is receiving a subsidy under the WSS.  It should, for example, be noted that if the restriction on a person&rsquo;s capacity for work is medically assessed as mild, they would not qualify for a PCB payment. </p>  <p>  For illustrative purposes, if it was to be assumed that all persons, whose employment is being subsidised by way of the WSS, would become eligible for a PCB payment at the current average PCB payment, the cost would be around &euro;20 million a year.    </p>  <p>  My Department has looked in the past at the cost of extending eligibility for the WSS to employers who employ people in receipt of PCB.  This is currently estimated to cost about &euro;3 million in a full year if such employment was at 21 hours per week.  This would rise to around &euro;5 million where employment was at the maximum of 39 hours per week.</p>  <p>  It is important to note, that the costing here assumes new PCB participants only, as a WSS payment can only be made where an individual is entering a new job or is in that job for less than 12 months.  Under current rules, employers would not be able to apply for those currently in receipt of PCB.  Furthermore, additional spending might arise if the numbers of employees at individual employer level were high enough to imply additional  spending under strands 2 and 3 of the WSS. </p>  <p>  The department continually reviews its supports and schemes however it is not intended to change the criteria for the above supports.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in this legislation when conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.  </p>  <p>  One of the provisions set out in Section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions, and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable citizens to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and/or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC.  It simply gives individuals the option to use their PSC if they wish, as proof of identity and/or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.</p>  <p>  For the sake of clarity, therefore, the Deputy should note that this proposal in no way allows nor can a private sector body access the customer data on the card or on any Government database.  It simply provides for the card be accepted as a form of identity verification by a private sector organisation or non-specified body - but only at the sole discretion of the card holder.  It is believed that this approach gives power to the individual to control access to and use of their PSC.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

If the issue is not resolved to their satisfaction, customers can then submit a formal complaint.  They can do so in a number of different ways, such as by letter, by email, or online using a <i>Customer Feedback Form, </i>which can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website:<i></i>.  Alternatively, customers can make contact by phone or they can speak face to face to a member of staff in any of our Intreo centres around the country. </p><p>If the customer is dissatisfied with the response received they can request to have their complaint reviewed by another independent officer, not previously involved in the original complaint investigation.

Furthermore, the issue was dealt with by the relevant market surveillance authority under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 and by building control authorities under the Building Control Acts 1990 &ndash; 2014 in the affected region. </p><p>Separately, in 2013, the issue of external walls of dwellings displaying significant cracking in Donegal was raised with my Department.  The nature of the problem related to the crumbling of the concrete blockwork in the external walls of affected dwellings, thereby compromising their structural integrity and giving rise to considerable personal distress to the many homeowners involved.  At that time, several hundred homes were suspected to be affected in north Donegal.  The presence of muscovite mica in abundant quantities in the aggregate constituent of the concrete blocks was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks.</p><p>By the end of 2013, similar problems had also come to light in both public and private dwellings located in west Mayo and Mayo County Council submitted a report to my Department on problems that had been identified with the concrete blockwork in their social housing stock.  In this instance, it was the presence of pyrite in the aggregate constituent of the concrete block that was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks.  The emergence of similar problems among private households located in County Mayo was also reported in 2013.</p><p>An Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was established by my Department in 2016 and its terms of reference were limited to the investigation of the problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Counties Donegal and Mayo.</p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  </p><p>The putting in place of such a scheme is now a key priority for the Department and work is well underway on the development of such a scheme, including discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding.  It is intended to revert to Government with proposals for the scheme as soon as possible with a view to publishing details of the scheme thereafter.  It should be noted that this scheme will only apply to affected homeowners in Donegal and Mayo.</p><p>A standardised protocol was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) on 13 November 2018 and is available at <i>www.nsai.ie</i>.  This standard can be used by homeowners anywhere in the country to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite and it will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all such affected properties.</p></reply>

Such valuations are a matter for the Commissioner of Valuation, who is the head of the Valuation Office, in the first instance.  The Commissioner is independent in the exercise of his functions.  I have no role in such matters.</p><p>The Valuation Acts 2001-2015 provide several avenues of redress for the occupiers of property and for a number of other categories of persons listed in the legislation who are dissatisfied with a determination of value under the provisions of the legislation.</p><p>Firstly, there is a statutory right for the occupier of a property to make representations within 40 days to the Valuation Office in relation to the proposed valuation to be placed on their property.  Since the statutory mandate of the Valuation Office is to ensure that valuations of all rateable property are correct, equitable and uniform, relative to each other, consideration of representations made to the Office in respect of an individual property may result in a decrease, increase or no change in the valuation of that property.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the outcome is based on the evidence provided to, and otherwise available to, the Valuation Office.  This outcome may be the subject of a subsequent appeal to the statutorily independent Valuation Tribunal.  Finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.  </p><p>In determining an appeal, the Valuation Tribunal may, under Section 37 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, decrease or increase a valuation or determine that no change is warranted.  </p><p>In reaching its decisions, the statutory duty of the members of the Valuation Tribunal is to ensure that valuations are (insofar as is reasonably practicable) correct, equitable and uniform, relative to each other.  Appeals to the Tribunal are dealt with in a comprehensive manner involving the consideration, on a quasi-judicial basis, of detailed, formal written documentation submitted to it.  The Tribunal can hold hearings as provided for in the legislation, which allows for the taking of oral evidence and the receipt and consideration of written submissions made to it by and on behalf of all parties to the appeal concerned, including any person appearing to the Tribunal to have an interest in or likely to be affected by the determination of the appeal.  When issuing its decisions, the Valuation Tribunal issues formal, written judgments which provide clear and cogent reasons for its decisions and these judgments are available to the public on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website, <i>www.valuationtribunal.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Therefore, the Government is committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland which will be targeted at households earning low to moderate incomes up to a maximum annual income of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.  </p>  <p>  Under the cost rental model, rents are set to recoup development and maintenance costs with a minimum amout of retained earnings.  Minimising retained earnings, land and other delivery costs, while securing competitive low-cost financing, means that affordable rents can be achieved.  The final rents, for any given project, will be set after all associated costs are determined, following on from the competitive construction and management tender processes.  However, in its appraisal of initial cost rental projects the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) estimate that rents of between 15-25% below market could be achieved.  </p>  <p>  Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  </p>  <p>  Cost rental is new to Ireland and, in order to drive delivery, a number of important early mover projects are being advanced, delivering important lessons in terms of cost rental in an Irish setting.  There are two pilot cost rental schemes being advanced: one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and one at Emmet Road in Inchicore. </p>  <p>  It is expected that 50 cost rental homes (33% of the total) will be made available on the Enniskerry Road site.  The tenders are currently being assessed for this project, and it is anticipated that construction will commence later in the first quarter of 2019.</p>  <p>  The current tenure mix for Emmet Road, as agreed with my Department, is 30% social and 70% cost rental, which equates to 330 cost rental homes.  While this project is at an earlier stage of development, Dublin City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to drive the project forward.  In addition to pre-existing consultative arrangements, the Council is also facilitating a special Consultative Forum specifically for this project.  It is expected that the procurement process will get underway later in quarter 1 of 2019. </p>  <p>  Cost rental will initially be managed on an administrative basis, and my Department is preparing a draft administrative cost rental framework in collaboration with the Housing Agency and the local authorities involved in these pilot projects.

Naas is one of two key towns identified in County Kildare in the draft Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) for the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly (EMRA) which is currently subject to public consultation. </p><p>Once finalised, the strategy is intended to further develop strategic planning policies contained in the National Planning Framework, for the period to 2031.  The population of Naas will grow further during this time and the extent of such growth, and how it will be planned for, will be a matter for Kildare County Council to determine, in the context of the County as a whole, subject to final determination of the RSES for the EMRA area.</p><p>The current projection underpinning the draft RSES for the EMRA area for County Kildare to 2026, i.e. over the next six-year County Development Plan period, is for an additional 31,500 people above 2016 levels.  This is comparable to adding the equivalent of 3-4 entire large towns combined, to the County over a 10-year period.  The County Development Plan review process must also ensure that there is capacity for up to a further 25% of the projected population target to 2026, or an additional 8,000 people in Kildare, to accommodate further growth into the future. </p><p>This means that the next six-year Kildare County Development Plan must make provision to accommodate almost 40,000 additional people over 2016 levels.  This is considered to be a sustainable level of development taking all of the relevant demographic, economic and planning factors into account in a balanced way across all the local authority areas and will allow the provision of infrastructure and services in line with housing development and the achievement of the strategic planning aims of Project Ireland 2040 in securing more compact urban development, including in Kildare in general and Naas town in particular.  </p><p>There is no evidence to suggest that Naas is being inhibited from availing of the full potential of its existing capital asset base.  In determining how best to accommodate a significant level of projected future population growth that takes account of wider national. regional and local drivers, Kildare County Council will take into consideration factors such as employment, transport, infrastructure and services like schools, parks, community and recreational facilities including childcare and healthcare, having regard to the needs of both the existing population and projected future populations.</p><p>The Draft RSES for the EMRA area, which includes County Kildare, was published on 5 November 2018 and is available to view online at the following link: <i>www.emra.ie/draft-rses-public-consultation</i>.</p><p>The consultation period on the Draft RSES will run until 23 January 2019, by which date it is open to any interested party to make a submission in writing to the Regional Assembly.  Following the consultation period, the EMRA will take all submissions received into account in the formulation of the final RSES, adoption of which will require approval by Assembly Members.</p></reply>

However, the range of wider policies to increase supply, such as providing more flexible planning standards as well as improving supports and services for the rented sector, will help to increase the number and types of properties available for rent, particularly in city centre areas. </p><p>The solution to the acute pressures are supply related - increasing the supply of houses/apartments for sale and rent will in turn reduce the pressure on rents and provide a wider choice for our citizens.</p><p>While the supply side actions are beginning to bear fruit, the Government&rsquo;s intervention in the rental market have been positive in moderating the rate of increase of rents through Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) and in providing more security of tenure for tenants.  Rent Pressure Zones are designated Local Electoral Areas or administrative areas of local authorities in which rent increases are restricted to a maximum of 4% per annum.</p><p>Section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended, provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered as a Rent Pressure Zone.  Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.  For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. </p><p>For an area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent.</p><p>The RTB Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone.  This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases.</p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at: <i></i>, by searching 'rent pressure zones - information'.</p><p>On 11 December 2018, the Government gave its approval to publish the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, which includes powers for the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct such as non-compliance with the rent increase restriction in Rent Pressure Zones.  The Bill will make it a criminal offence for landlords to, inter alia, implement rent increases that contravene the law or fail to cooperate with an investigation or to register and update tenancies with the RTB.  It will allow the RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made.</p><p>These key measures and reforms are designed to enhance enforcement powers for the RTB, provide greater security of tenure for tenants and further underpin the operation of the RPZ arrangements, and  will not only protect those who are renting but will also deliver greater stability and transparency to the rental sector.</p><p>The issue of taxation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive.   </p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced in early 2019, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in mid-2019.  </p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p>  <p>   In relation to solar farms, as is the case with the large majority of development types, there are currently no specific planning guidelines in place in respect of solar farms.  Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments, with planning applications made to the relevant local planning authority and with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Within the wider national and local planning context, planning authorities must make their decisions, based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications. </p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning applications for solar farm developments, the matter is being kept under review, in consultation with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, who leads on renewable energy policy.  Our two Departments are presently exploring the potential for enhancing national planning guidance on solar energy, taking account of solar energy projects being assessed by planning authorities and the scope for future development of the sector in the context of the ongoing development of renewable energy policy.  </p>  <p>  On foot of this on-going engagement between the two Departments, where the need for specific planning guidance for solar farms is identified, my Department will develop such guidance as appropriate.</p></reply>

One of the main criteria underpinning the MTR scheme is that it is a social housing option and therefore is targeted at those borrowers in arrears who qualify for social housing support as prescribed by the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for individual housing authorities to assess a household's income for social housing support eligibility in accordance with the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, which prescribe maximum net income limits for each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports is underway.  The Housing Agency is continuing to carry out the detailed statistical work, which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. The review will obviously have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.  To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require that owners or occupiers take appropriate measures on derelict sites, to acquire derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and to apply a derelict sites levy on the registered owners of derelict sites. </p>  <p>  It is open to any person to contact a local authority in relation to a particular site which may be considered a derelict site for the purposes of the Act.  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a register of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site. Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the register for any local authority area can be inspected at the offices of the relevant authority.  It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.  </p>  <p>  My Department collects derelict sites data at the local authority level and accordingly the information requested regarding the number of derelict sites levied in specified towns in Cork County Council's administrative area is not readily available in my Department.  According to the most recent information held by my Department, which relates to 2017, there were 197 derelict sites listed on the register of Cork County Council at 31 December 2017.  Of these, 19 sites were subject to the levy in 2017 and the Council has confirmed that none of these sites were located in the specified towns.  Instead the Council is seeking to positively engage with the majority of the owners of registered derelict sites through mechanisms other than the levy, such as the promotion of initiatives including the Repair and Lease Scheme and the Buy and Renew Scheme with a view to bringing the properties concerned back into productive use for social housing purposes.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  Responsibility for the provision, funding and oversight of services to support victims of domestic violence, including refuges, rests with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p>  <p>  In line with commitments made under Rebuilding Ireland, my Department issued guidance in January 2017 to all local authorities in relation to assisting victims of domestic violence with emergency and long-term accommodation needs.  The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers working in the domestic violence services sector, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence in seeking social housing supports.  These include provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.</p></reply>

The working group comprises senior officials from the Planning Division of my Department and senior officials from the Planning Divisions of local authorities, nominated by the local government sector.  </p>  <p>  The objective is to ensure that rural housing policies and objectives contained in local authority development plans comply with the relevant provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  </p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (the NPF) also provides an important context for the finalisation of the revisions to the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines.  National Policy Objective 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from uncoordinated and ribbon-type development, in order to avoid over-development of those areas. Accordingly, the NPF objectives are aligned with the approach already expected of planning authorities under the current Guidelines. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the engagement with the European Commission on the matter and subject to the completion of the ongoing deliberations by the working group, I expect to be in a position to shortly finalise and issue to planning authorities revisions to the 2005 Rural Housing Guidelines that take account of the relevant ECJ judgment.</p></reply>

The plan focuses on increasing the delivery of social housing, with a target of delivering 50,000 social housing homes in the period to 2021, while also making the best use of existing stock and laying the foundations for a more vibrant housing sector.</p>  <p>  Households experiencing homelessness are supported by the local authorities and their service delivery partners to exit homelessness into an independent tenancy, whether it be in a local authority property or a HAP supported tenancy in the private rental sector.  In 2018, the HAP Placefinder service was made available to all local authorities to support households to identify and secure a tenancy. </p>  <p>  The allocation of social housing support is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations.  Section 22 of the 2009 Act requires all local authorities to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households. </p>  <p>  To strengthen further the rights of tenants in the private rented sector, building on initiatives already taken, I published the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2018 in December 2018.  Among the key provisions of the Bill are measures to empower the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct including non-compliance with rent increase restrictions in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs); the creation of criminal offences for landlords connected with non-compliance with rent increase restrictions in RPZs; and increasing notice periods for tenancy terminations by landlords.</p></reply>

Much of this increase is attributable to the increased use of compulsory purchase order powers by local authorities to acquire individual vacant or derelict houses for social housing purposes, which is a positive development.</p><p>Local authorities are encouraged to adopt a proactive approach in utilising their available legislative powers for compulsory purchase, where necessary, with the aim of bringing the greatest number of recoverable long term vacant dwellings back into the livable housing stock.

The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p><p>On 11 December 2018, I issued approval in principle for ten infrastructure projects across five local authority areas, in Dublin and Cork, under the first SSF call for proposals. This first tranche of funding of &euro;43 million will enable the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes on local authority lands. I expect infrastructure works on these projects to begin as soon as possible and delivery of affordable homes from early 2020 onwards. Details of these projects are set out in the table below. There are five further projects under active consideration by my Department, with the potential to facilitate the delivery of an additional 230 affordable homes. A second call for proposals will issue early this year.</p><p>Table 1: List of projects that have received approval in principle under the SSF first call for proposals<table><tr><th>Local   Authority</th><th>Project/Location</th><th>Total   Provisional Cost of Proposal&euro;</th><th>Provisional   Exchequer Grant Amount &euro;</th><th>Provisional   Local Authority Contribution&euro;</th><th>AffordableHousing   Potential</th></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>Glanmire</td><td>&euro;1,500,000</td><td>&euro;1,335,000</td><td>&euro;165,000</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>Boherboy Road</td><td>&euro;4,968,366</td><td>&euro;4,421,846</td><td>&euro;546,520</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>Kilmore Road, Churchfield</td><td>&euro;1,410,551</td><td>&euro;1,255,390</td><td>&euro;155,160</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Cherry Orchard</td><td>&euro;7,645,415</td><td>&euro;6,804,419</td><td>&euro;840,996</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Balbutcher, Ballymun</td><td>&euro;4,135,351</td><td>&euro;3,680,462</td><td>&euro;454,889</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Sillogue, Ballymun</td><td>&euro;3,975,000</td><td>&euro;3,537,750</td><td>&euro;437,250</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>Enniskerry   Road</td><td>&euro;4,537,576</td><td>&euro;4,038,443</td><td>&euro;499,133</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Church Fields, Mulhuddart</td><td>&euro;11,000,000</td><td>&euro;9,790,000</td><td>&euro;1,210,000</td><td>753</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Dun Emer, Lusk</td><td>&euro;1,500,000</td><td>&euro;1,335,000</td><td>&euro;165,000</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Hackettstown, Skerries</td><td>&euro;2,198,667</td><td>&euro;1,956,814</td><td>&euro;241,853</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>&euro;42,870,926</td><td>&euro;38,155,124</td><td>&euro;4,715,801</td><td>1410</td></tr></table></p><p>The cost of constructing new affordable homes is dependent on a range of variables, such as the location, the scale of the development and the size and type of the homes involved. However, in preparing their bids for funding under the SSF, local authorities were advised to be guided by the Unit Cost Ceilings (UCCs) for social housing in determining the cost of the affordable homes to be delivered under this programme. </p><p>These UCCs are based on the analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period, and market tender index information. Construction cost is reflective of building costs (including VAT) and also includes normal site works and site development. All-in cost includes cost of construction, land cost, professional fees, utility connections, site investigations/surveys, archaeology where appropriate, VAT and contribution to public art. Abnormal costs are excluded from these figures.  </p><p>The relevant UCC data for the Dublin local authorities is set out in the tables below.  </p><p>An important factor in the allocation of funding under the SSF is the capacity to translate that funding into a discount on the affordable homes. In addition, local authorities must consider the market price of similar homes on sale in the equivalent private market and the level of discount on market price envisaged, which will be required under the Affordable Purchase Scheme terms. The objective is to maximise the benefits from public money by funding the best value for money proposals possible. </p><p>Table 2: Houses, average costs (2017 Unit Cost Ceilings)<table><tr><th></th><th>1 bed</th><th>1 bed</th><th>2 bed (1 storey)</th><th>2 bed (1 storey)</th><th>2 bed (2 storey)</th><th>2 bed (2 storey)</th><th>3 bed</th><th>3 bed</th><th>4 bed</th><th>4 bed </th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td></tr><tr><td>DCC</td><td>216,800</td><td>275,900</td><td>223,200</td><td>283,600</td><td>232,200</td><td>293,800</td><td>242,300</td><td>305,300</td><td>252,800</td><td>316,900</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>182,000</td><td>234,500</td><td>187,800</td><td>240,300</td><td>195,900</td><td>249,600</td><td>205,300</td><td>260,100</td><td>214,600</td><td>270,600</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>166,800</td><td>217,000</td><td>172,600</td><td>224,000</td><td>180,800</td><td>232,100</td><td>190,100</td><td>242,600</td><td>199,500</td><td>253,200</td></tr><tr><td>SDCC</td><td>182,000</td><td>234,500</td><td>187,800</td><td>240,300</td><td>195,900</td><td>249,600</td><td>205,300</td><td>260,100</td><td>214,600</td><td>270,600</td></tr></table></p><p>Table 3: Apartments, average costs (2017 Unit Cost Ceilings)<table><tr><th></th><th>1 bed</th><th>1 bed</th><th>2 bed</th><th>2 bed</th><th>3 bed</th><th>3 bed</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td><td>Construct</td><td>All-in</td></tr><tr><td>DCC</td><td>227,700</td><td>289,600</td><td>234,400</td><td>297,800</td><td>256,100</td><td>324,000</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>191,100</td><td>246,200</td><td>197,200</td><td>252,300</td><td>216,000</td><td>275,200</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>175,100</td><td>227,800</td><td>181,200</td><td>235,200</td><td>199,300</td><td>255,900</td></tr><tr><td>SDCC</td><td>191,100</td><td>246,200</td><td>197,200</td><td>252,300</td><td>216,000</td><td>275,200</td></tr></table></p></reply>

They are not asked for more specific information, such as whether they are a 'wheelchair user'.  It is not possible, therefore, to say how many wheelchair users are on the housing waiting list currently or how many have been allocated housing in previous years. These applicants are assessed as people with a physical disability but, in so doing, the local authority takes account of their individual needs, including the use of wheelchairs.</p>  <p>  My Department, in close collaboration with the local authority sector, keeps the categorisation of housing need under continuous review. In this context consideration can be given to creating more defined categories of need, such as for example 'wheelchair user', if this was determined to be useful in terms of the strategic targeting of social housing delivery and allocation. However, this would need to be balanced with other considerations including the impact on the efficiency of the administration process surrounding assessment and allocations.   </p>  <p>  One of the key initiatives under the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability (NHSPWD), which has been extended to 2020, was the establishment of Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) in all housing authority areas, to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level.  These are chaired by Directors of Housing in each authority and include HSE and disability representative organisations.  </p>  <p>  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging need over the next five years. These Plans, the majority of which are now available on the relevant local authority websites, along with the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), will allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and will support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms.</p>  <p>  Preliminary local authority figures in respect of 2017 indicate that the number of housing allocations to persons with a physical disability increased by 18% on 2016.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs is met upfront by the local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB). This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 5 years. The value of the repairs is then offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.</p><p>A property owner can either choose to arrange for a contractor to carry out the repairs themselves, or the local authority or AHB can arrange this instead. The relevant local authority determines eligibility for the scheme, having regard to the location and the suitability of the property for social housing and also taking into consideration the extent of the repairs that may be required. The maximum costs of repairs allowable under this initiative is &euro;40,000 (&euro;50,000 for former bedsits) and the property must be vacant for a period of not less than 12 months. </p><p>At the end of Q3 2018, a total of 1,214 applications had been received under the scheme; 122 agreements for lease had been signed and 48 homes had been delivered and tenanted.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility and neither the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government nor I have any function in decisions in this regard.</p><p>Under Irish law, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority.</p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.</p><p>A valuation for commercial rates purposes is arrived at by estimating the <i>Net Annual Value</i>(NAV) of the property in question, at a specified valuation date. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 as &ldquo;the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant&rdquo;. This definition of Net Annual Value is applied to all rateable properties and classes of business on a nationwide basis.</p><p>Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based exercise. During a revaluation, the Valuation Office analyses relevant market rental transactions for all rateable properties, in accordance with the legislation, best practice internationally as set out in published Practice Guidance Notes, well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts. The conclusions drawn from that analysis is applied to similarly circumstanced property using the &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; method of valuation which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties.</p><p>There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is also a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law. Appeals are made on an individual case basis, having regard to the particular circumstances of the property under appeal. However, the decision in one case can have relevance in other similar cases.</p><p>There is no provision in the legislation for taking a &ldquo;class&rdquo; or group appeal before the Tribunal, as each case is considered on its individual merits and by reference to the specific circumstances of the property. For these reasons, I have no plans to introduce legislative proposals along the lines indicated in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. However, I am advised that individual appellants can make arguments to the Valuation Tribunal in relation to their concerns about the overall valuation methodology adopted by the Valuation Office for a specific category of rateable property, should they wish to do so.  <b></b></p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am informed that, as a practical measure, it is possible for a Test case to be heard by the Valuation Tribunal. In order to proceed with a Test case, both parties involved, the appellant and the respondent, must agree that such an approach is appropriate. In addition, such a process must be entered into on the clear understanding on how precisely the determination of the Valuation Tribunal in the Test case would be applied to the other cases under appeal identified as being part of the test case series. All cases involved must be similarly circumstanced. A Test case is identified and nominated through mutual agreement between appellants, their representatives or agents and the Valuation Office and this is notified to the Valuation Tribunal. The nominated case would then be heard by the Valuation Tribunal in the normal course.  </p><p>The Valuation Tribunal is advised of the details of the other appeals to which the outcome of the Test case appeal will apply and the agreed terms of how specifically the outcome of the Test case is to be applied to the other cases in the Test case series. The right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law for either the appellant or respondent still applies in a Test case situation.</p></reply>

These include putting in place measures to ensure that sustainable housing is provided in the right location to enable people to age in the community; to design housing and the environment in accordance with the principles of sustainable lifetime housing; to promote the use of assistive technology to support people to live independently; to give adequate consideration to the need for social connectedness in devising policy; and to work collaboratively with all stakeholders to achieve the policy objectives.</p>  <p>  An Expert Conference on Housing for Older People was held in Farmleigh on 20 November 2018 hosted by my Department and the Department of Health.

The policy statement will set out a framework by which the Government can facilitate housing, including housing with care, for older people having regard to current demographics and looking at best practice models. The aim is to ensure that people can grow old and live in a community of their choosing, with dignity and independence.</p>  <p>  At this time, no discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of Health and Local Authorities in relation to plans to provide State funded retirement villages. </p></reply>

Harnessing the off-balance sheet potential of private investment in social housing is an important contributor to meeting this objective and the social housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland over the period to 2021 reflect the ambition in that regard. Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 will be leased by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources and funded under my Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP). High quality secure properties which represent value for money and are available on a long-term basis are being targeted by local authorities around the country to accommodate people on local authority waiting lists.  </p>  <p>  The new Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme has been developed by my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), the Housing Agency and local authorities, in order to harness the potential of private sector interest in social housing delivery in a new set of long-term leasing arrangements, in a manner designed to leverage off-balance sheet funding opportunities in accordance with Rebuilding Ireland objectives. The Scheme is targeted at new build or new to the market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available. </p>  <p>  The scheme is governed by my Department and operated by local authorities. The Housing Agency manages and administers the scheme on behalf of my Department and acts as a national co-ordinator.  The rollout of this scheme will result in no additional costs to the Exchequer, with costs being met from existing budgetary allocations for Rebuilding Ireland. The lease term available to private investors can be up to a maximum of 25 years, with the asset remaining with the proposer at the end of that term. </p>  <p>  The new Enhanced Lease and related technical documents have been developed and tested to ensure there is no negative impact arising from how are they are viewed and treated in respect of the State&rsquo;s General Government Balance Sheet.  In order to ensure that the Scheme remains &ldquo;off-Balance Sheet&rdquo; the CSO has advised that the lessor should be responsible for management and maintenance and that the lessor must be free to decide whether to continue to rent the homes or to sell them to whomever they wish at the end of the term of the lease. The automatic reversion of the asset to the lessee (i.e. the local authority) may have a detrimental impact on this classification.  My Department has also made changes to the existing standard Long Term Leasing arrangements in order to provide for a lease term of up to 25 years. </p>  <p>  With respect to the delivery of affordable housing, I have commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place a new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing. It is intended that the income thresholds will be the same as for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and other criteria will be set out in regulations. The elected members of each local authority will be responsible for determining the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households, in line with the framework of the national scheme. </p>  <p>  In order to deliver affordable housing in the areas of the country most affected by a lack of affordable housing supply, a three-pronged, targeted approach is being pursued. The Government has committed &euro;310 million to support this programme of work, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), as part of Budget 2019. The Exchequer contribution is &euro;275 million with &euro;35 million to be contributed by local authorities. In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p>  <p>  I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis some 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated.</p>  <p>  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, under recently commenced provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out more generally. Under the 2009 Act, the maximum discount is 40% of the market value of the home and the local authority takes a charge, equivalent to the discount, against the property. The scheme applies to new homes, and is targeted at single applicants earning up to &euro;50,000 per annum or &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.</p>  <p>  Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other urban centres are currently facing significant access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  </p>  <p>  Under the cost rental model, minimising retained earnings, land and other delivery costs, while securing very competitive European Investment Bank (EIB) financing, means that affordable rents can be achieved. The final rents, for any given project, will be set after all associated costs are determined, following on from the competitive construction and management tender processes. Cost rental homes will be targeted at households earning up to &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants. </p>  <p>  Cost rental is new to Ireland and in order to drive delivery, a number of important early mover projects are being advanced, delivering important lessons in terms of cost rental in an Irish setting. There are two pilot cost rental schemes being advanced: one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and one at St Michaels Estate in Inchicore. It is expected that 50 cost rental units and 105 social homes will be made available on the Enniskerry Road site. While the final tenure-mix on the Inchicore site will be decided by Dublin City Council, informed by the detailed site development process, it will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided by the City Council under cost rental arrangements.  </p>  <p>   My Department is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency and the new Land Development Agency to examine the optimum funding and delivery options to support cost rental delivery at scale.</p></reply>

It has been established under the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan) Regulations 2018, which also provide for the issuance of a statutory Credit Policy.

However, in making any recommendations in relation to the operation of the scheme, it must also take account of the need to ensure that lending issued under it is provided on a prudential basis, so as to protect the financial interests of the borrowers and the local authorities.    </p>  <p>  Applicants for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan must be of good credit standing and have a satisfactory credit record. A person who has been discharged from bankruptcy and who meets the other eligibility criteria, including being a first-time buyer, may apply for a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and will be subject to the same credit assessment process that applies to all applicants.</p>  <p>  As with the previous local authority home loan offerings, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first time buyers only.  There is no change in this regard.  This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources.</p></reply>

Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there has been a reduction in the Board's compliance rate with the statutory objective period over the past year due to a number of factors, including an increase in the number of cases it has received.  At end November 2018, the compliance rate for determining normal planning appeals within the statutory objective period stood at 35%, and for all planning cases, the rate stood at 41%.  </p>  <p>  A range of measures have been taken to address the situation, including the appointment of additional Board members and additional resources. While current staff resources are lower than at the peak in 2008, the caseload levels, though now increasing, are still at lower levels than at the peak.  Staffing levels are similar to levels in 2010 when the caseload was comparable, though on-going and planned recruitment processes will see staffing increase further in the months ahead.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied, taking account also of the increased Exchequer grant of &euro;18.5m for the Board in 2019, a 7% increase on 2018, that the measures involved will enable the Board to significantly improve its compliance rate over the coming months.  Indeed, the number of cases decided by the Board in the 11 months to end November 2018 was up 29% on the corresponding period in 2017 and the Board's output is now at circa 250 cases per month.  </p>  <p>  The Board has a complement of 11 members, including a new Chairperson who took up duty on 30 October 2018, and an extra Board member engaged in June 2018 to supplement the normal complement of 10 members. While two vacancies have recently arisen on the Board within that complement, these are due to be filled shortly.  The Board also employs over 150 staff members including 10 additional dedicated staff engaged in 2017 to support the Strategic Housing Division. My Department will continue to liaise closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources to support it in the performance of its functions.</p></reply>

In particular, for those households earning annual gross incomes up to &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants. </p><p>In terms of affordable purchase, I commenced the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 on 18 June 2018, to provide a statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase. Part 5 contains significant detail on the procedures and operation of the new Affordable Purchase Scheme. The primary legislation will be supported by associated regulations, which are currently being finalised, following extensive consultation between my Department, the Housing Agency and local authorities. The regulations, once finalised, together with guidance, will issue to local authorities.</p><p>In order to support the affordable housing programmes of local authorities, the Government has committed &euro;310 million, over the three years 2019 to 2021, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) announced as part of Budget 2019. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p><p>On 11 December 2018, I issued approval in principle for ten infrastructure projects across five local authority areas, in Dublin and Cork, under the first SSF call for proposals. This first tranche of funding of &euro;43 million will enable the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes on local authority lands. I expect infrastructure works on these projects to begin as soon as possible and delivery of affordable homes from early 2020 onwards. Details of these projects are set out in the table below. There are five further projects under active consideration by my Department, with the potential to facilitate the delivery of an additional 230 affordable homes. </p><p>More broadly, all local authorities have been asked to carry out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. A second call for proposals under the Fund will be made shortly. The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned assessments, which are currently being examined in my Department.</p><p>The Government is also committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work. Like affordable purchase, cost rental homes will be targeted at households earning incomes up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.</p><p>As cost rental is a new housing model to Ireland and in order to drive delivery, a number of important early mover projects are being advanced, delivering important lessons in terms of cost rental in an Irish setting. These cost rental pilot schemes are at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and Emmet Road in Inchicore, respectively.</p><p>It is expected that 50 cost rental units and 105 social homes will be made available on the Enniskerry Road site. The tenders for the project are currently being assessed, and it is anticipated that construction will commence later in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>Dublin City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to drive the Emmet Road project forward. While the final tenure-mix on the site will be decided by the Council, informed by the detailed site development process, it will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided under cost rental arrangements.</p><p>These initiatives complement other Government actions which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p><p>Table<b>: </b>List of projects that have received approval in principle under the SSF first call for proposals<table><tr><th>LA</th><th>Project/ Location</th><th>Total Provisional Cost of Proposal &euro;</th><th>Provisional Exchequer Grant Amount &euro;</th><th>Provisional LA Contribution &euro;</th><th>Affordable Housing Potential</th></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>Glanmire</td><td>&euro;1,500,000</td><td>&euro;1,335,000</td><td>&euro;165,000</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>Boherboy Road</td><td>&euro;4,968,366</td><td>&euro;4,421,846</td><td>&euro;546,520</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>Kilmore Road, Churchfield</td><td>&euro;1,410,551</td><td>&euro;1,255,390</td><td>&euro;155,160</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Cherry Orchard</td><td>&euro;7,645,415</td><td>&euro;6,804,419</td><td>&euro;840,996</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Balbutcher, Ballymun</td><td>&euro;4,135,351</td><td>&euro;3,680,462</td><td>&euro;454,889</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>Sillogue, Ballymun</td><td>&euro;3,975,000</td><td>&euro;3,537,750</td><td>&euro;437,250</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>Enniskerry   Road</td><td>&euro;4,537,576</td><td>&euro;4,038,443</td><td>&euro;499,133</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Church Fields, Mulhuddart</td><td>&euro;11,000,000</td><td>&euro;9,790,000</td><td>&euro;1,210,000</td><td>753</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Dun Emer, Lusk</td><td>&euro;1,500,000</td><td>&euro;1,335,000</td><td>&euro;165,000</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>Hackettstown, Skerries</td><td>&euro;2,198,667</td><td>&euro;1,956,814</td><td>&euro;241,853</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>&euro;42,870,926</td><td>&euro;38,155,124</td><td>&euro;4,715,801</td><td>1410</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These bodies are supported through a range of schemes for both social and affordable housing which are funded by the State through the local authorities.

These reports provide information on the construction programme underway for each local authority area. The report covering the period up to end Quarter 3 of 2018 is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:<i></i>. The report reflects an increase in the scale of the social housing build programme, with 1,173 schemes (or phases of schemes) in place, delivering 17,536 homes.

This represents a decrease of 13,941 households or 16.2% on the last assessment in June 2017. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 71,858, a reduction of 22%. </p><p>It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time exercise and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the list. It is also important to note that social housing is a demand led service and for that reason it is difficult to predict the degree to which housing lists will decrease or increase over the next 12 months. The number of homes delivered by local authorities in a given time period does not necessarily equate to the &lsquo;net need&rsquo; for social housing support reducing by an equivalent number. The nature of the list is dynamic in that, as households are added to it, the needs of others are met and further households will leave the list for various reasons including the households themselves indicating that they no longer require State support.</p><p>I have set delivery targets for all local authorities out to 2021, based on current housing need. It is acknowledged that future annualised assessments may see individual local authorities housing need numbers rising, or falling, for a variety of reasons. The targets have been set in such a way as to be able to respond to such an eventuality over the course of the period covered by Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p>Over the six years of Rebuilding Ireland, the Government is committed to meeting the housing needs of over 137,000 households through the provision of social housing supports. The implementation of the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan is well underway and significant progress has been made. Annual delivery targets were exceeded in 2016 and again in 2017. By end September 2018, over 63,700 additional social housing solutions have already been provided under the plan. </p><p>The latest data in relation to social housing delivery to end Q3 2018 is published on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Data in relation to Q4 2018 outputs is currently being compiled and will be published shortly.</p><p>The importance of aligning social housing delivery with housing need has been a consistent theme of the three housing summits I have held with local authority Chief Executives during 2017 and 2018. Following on from these summits and the commitments given and objectives set there, my Department engages with all local authorities on a regular basis regarding the delivery of social housing.

A detailed breakdown of the social housing construction programme is set out in the <i>Social Housing Construction Status Report</i>which is published on a quarterly basis. These reports provide information on the construction programme underway for each local authority area. The report covering the period up to end Quarter 3 2018 is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i><i>.</i>The report for Q4 2018 is currently being prepared. </p><p>In terms of affordable housing, a targeted approach is being pursued to support local authorities. To this end, I have provided additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund. Under Budget 2019, a total of &euro;310 million will be provided for this purpose over the course of 2019 to 2021. I approved the first tranche of funding under the Fund on 11 December 2018, through which some &euro;43 million in funding is being provided to facilitate the delivery of some 1,400 affordable homes in Dublin and Cork . A second call for proposals will issue shortly.</p><p>The combination of this Fund and the significantly increased funding for the social housing programme will open up more significant opportunities for larger mixed-tenure developments and my Department will continue to engage proactively with local authorities to accelerate the delivery of these projects.</p></reply>

There is a recognised quality of life benefit in terms of facilitating the continued independent living by older people and people with a disability in their own homes. To this end, my Department continues to support local authorities with schemes such as the Disabled Persons Grants scheme (DPGs) and the Housing Adaptation Grant Scheme.  This is also recognised in the Programme for a Partnership Government and funding for these schemes has been prioritised and increased year on year since 2014. </p>  <p>  Under the DPGs scheme, my Department provides local authorities with capital funding for adaptations and extensions to existing social housing stock to meet the needs of local authority tenants. The scheme applies to adaptations that are necessary to address the needs of older people or people with a disability who may require stair-lifts; grab-rails; showers; wet-rooms and ramps etc. It also provides funding for extensions such as the installation of a downstairs bedroom or bathroom or in the case of overcrowding. </p>  <p>  Under the DPG scheme, funding is also provided to local authorities for Improvement Works In Lieu (IWIL&rsquo;s) to enable them to repair, improve or extend privately owned houses that are occupied by approved housing applicants as an alternative to the provision of local authority housing.</p>  <p>  Funding recouped to local authorities by my Department has steadily increased in recent years. In 2018, &euro;15.4m was recouped under the DPG scheme. In order to ensure that there are no delays, for priority and urgent cases, local authorities may undertake works of up to 65% of their 2018 allocation in advance of the notification of their 2019 funding. In this regard, a circular will issue to local authorities shortly.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding under the suite of Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, in respect of private housing. The schemes are 80% funded by my Department, with a 20% contribution from the local authority. For 2019, a total of &euro;71.25 million will be provided for the schemes, which represents an 8% increase on the funding provided in 2018. </p>  <p>  Further consideration will be given to increasing this funding over the coming years in the context of the range of housing supports and provision being made under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p>  <p>  Policy responsibility in relation to insurance is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, with the insurance sector being subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>  <p>  In response to the defects that have come to light in relation residential buildings built during the 2000's, the Government&rsquo;s focus has primarily been on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance with the Building Regulations. This reduces the risk and the incidence of defective buildings and has provided insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to introduce new latent defect type products in Ireland, despite a general retrenchment and conservatism in the wider insurance industry. These new products are first party insurance policies which cover damage and non-damage (breaches of buildings) claims, to varying degrees. This means that the purchaser does not have to make a claim through the builder but can submit a claim directly to the insurer. This would be of particular benefit to a homeowner in circumstances where the builder or developer has ceased trading. It is critical that consumers, house purchasers and the public are aware of the various insurance products available and the scope of such policies. </p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority which can take action if a development does not have the required permission or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers in this regard.  A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice in connection with an unauthorised development, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a court order under section 160 of the Planning and Development Act requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  Indeed, section 160 of the Act provides that anyone may seek a court order in relation to unauthorised development; such action is not restricted to planning authorities.</p></reply>

Details of this information per year are outlined in the table below.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>No. of appeals submitted </th><th>No. of successful appeals</th><th>Percentage of appeals submitted that were successful</th><th>No. of partially successful appeals</th><th>Percentage of appeals submitted that were partially successful </th></tr><tr><td>2000 </td><td>27</td><td>8</td><td>29.6%</td><td>9</td><td>33.3%</td></tr><tr><td>2001 </td><td>16</td><td>4</td><td>25.0%</td><td>2</td><td>12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2002 </td><td>22</td><td>2</td><td>9.1%</td><td>1</td><td>4.5%</td></tr><tr><td>2003 </td><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>45.5%</td><td>3</td><td>27.3%</td></tr><tr><td>2004 </td><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>41.7%</td><td>4</td><td>33.3%</td></tr><tr><td>2005 </td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>25.0%</td><td>3</td><td>25.0%</td></tr><tr><td>2006 </td><td>14</td><td>4</td><td>28.6%</td><td>4</td><td>28.6%</td></tr><tr><td>2007 </td><td>179</td><td>23</td><td>12.8%</td><td>44</td><td>24.6%</td></tr><tr><td>2008 </td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>12</td><td>2</td><td>16.7%</td><td>2</td><td>16.7%</td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>80.0%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>0</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>320</td><td>60</td><td>18.8%</td><td>72</td><td>22.5%</td></tr></table></p><p>Based on the information available, the average time taken to process an appeal, from the date of submission of an appeal to the date the appeal was closed, was 20.4 months. For some of these appeals the landowners were notified of the outcome but the appeal was not marked as closed within the Department until some time later. This brings up the figure for the average time taken to process an appeal.</p><p>In the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 239 of 15 November 2018 it was set out that the number of appeals, in relation to sites proposed for designation as special areas of conservation, submitted to my Department in 2013 was 1. Due to an administrative error in the compilation of this information in the short time available marine site appeals were inadvertently excluded and the figure should have been 55.  </p></reply>

The 1926 Census was the first undertaken by the independent State, just four years after the Treaty was signed and three years after the Civil War.  I understand that this is a historic collection of great value and interest for historians, researchers, the general public and the Diaspora. </p><p>Census collection and census records are provided for in the Statistics Act 1993.  Responsibility for this legislation falls under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. Under sections 33 and 35 of that Act, information gathered by the Census which relates either directly or indirectly to an identifiable person cannot be released until 100 years after the date of the relevant census.</p><p>I have been informed that making the 1926 Census available to the public will require a significant volume of work which will involve both the conservation and the digitisation of the data in the individual 1926 Census forms.  This will take several years.  Nevertheless, I hope that it will be ready for public release at the end of the statute period in 2026.</p><p>I am pleased to advise that my Departments website, <i>www.irishgenealogy.ie</i>contains Civil Records of Births over 100 years old, Marriages over 75 years old and Deaths over 50 years old.  It is also possible to search for death records from that period on<i>www.irishgenealogy.ie</i>.  There is also a feedback mechanism on the website along with plenty of useful advice and tips to assist in carrying out searches on the website.</p></reply>

Waterways Ireland Operational staff, lockkeepers and waterway patrollers meet canal users on a daily basis and provide a wide range of services to all our recreational users.</p>  <p>  Inspectorate staff manage boat use on the canals in accordance with the 1988 Canal Bye-laws.  In this regard, Waterways Ireland continues to concentrate on boats which consistently remain in breach of the Bye-laws.  Where a boat owner fails to respond to requests to comply, after notification by letters, telephone calls and formal notice, a programme of boat removal continues.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Act 2018 was signed into law by the President on 18 July 2018 and Waterways Ireland will consult with its stakeholders in the drafting of additional Byelaws to ensure proper regulation of craft on the waterways.</p></reply>

The majority of coursing meetings organised by the ICC relate to regular coursing where hares are captured under licence, are kept in a hare park, are released to course over a designated track and then re-released back into the wild. It is my understanding that in open coursing hares are not captured but are already present in the countryside, and therefore a netting licence would not arise.  </p>  <p>  Where resources allow, local National Parks and Wildlife Service conservation rangers and other staff attend coursing meetings to conduct on-the-spot checks and to monitor compliance with licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club and its affiliated clubs.  My Department has concentrated its efforts on monitoring regular coursing meetings, including more recently on monitoring coursing trials. My Department is actively re-evaluating its approach to open coursing events.</p></reply>

It is not compensation for designation as such, but it addresses costs or losses which might arise.</p>  <p>  It continues to be my intention to increase the scope of the Scheme on a targeted and prioritised basis as funding permits. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) is also operating many targeted schemes for farmers in designated areas. The DAFM GLAS scheme has provided prioritised entry into GLAS and elevated GLAS payments in certain designated areas. It is important that the Farm Plan Scheme is coherent with these schemes and the Basic Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  Funding for the Natura 2000 network is currently available from existing financial instruments, as foreseen in Article 8 of the Habitats Directive.  This includes, but is not limited to, CAP funding. My Department has access only to national exchequer funding and at present this funding is limited.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently commenced an in-depth, site-by-site analysis of the measures required to achieve good status for the habitats and species that we collectively are protecting in SACs. This will include a review of measures currently operating through GLAS, the NPWS farm plan scheme, LIFE etc. This process will take a number of months but will enable us to set priorities for action and to seek funding for such actions through the budgetary process. </p></reply>

Culture Ireland considers applications for all forms of the arts, including photography, as defined in the Arts Act 2003:</p><p>&ldquo;arts means any creative or interpretative expression (whether traditional or contemporary) in whatever form, and includes, in particular, visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, film, circus and architecture, and includes any medium when used for those purposes&rdquo;. </p><p>Only international events are supported (i.e. outside the island of Ireland), the event / exhibition must be accessible to an open public audience and fees must be payable to the artist or arts organisation. </p><p>Applications deemed eligible are firstly assessed on the artistic quality of work which could be defined as work that is ambitious, excellent and original, connects to audiences and has been presented nationally to critical acclaim. The assessment of the artistic quality of the proposed work is made using knowledge, experience and specialist advice. Other criteria for assessment include the track record of the artist or arts organisation; the financial and operational viability of the event and proven capacity of the applicant, artist or arts organisation to present work internationally; the profile of the international venue/festival and the wider promotional and the media impact anticipated.</p><p>In supporting an event, Culture Ireland offers grant funding towards costs which relate to the international presentation of the event (costs<b></b>such as transport, accommodation and subsistence) rather than the creation of the art work. As such photographers can apply for Culture Ireland support in relation to the presentation of their work to international audiences, subject to other eligibility criteria. However, due to the competitive nature of each grant round and limited funding, eligibility and compliance with criteria for assessment alone do not guarantee that an applicant will receive grant funding.</p></reply>

This project is hugely important for the border region with potential to stimulate economic activity, giving a much needed boost to job creation and with the growth in water based tourism helping to attract significant numbers of visitors to the area.  This is increasingly significant in the context of Brexit.  </p><p>Government approval for Phase 1 of this project, to restore a 2.5 km stretch of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne in County Fermanagh to the International Scout Centre at Castle Saunderson near Belturbet in Co. Cavan, was secured in February 2015.</p><p>The works to complete this first phase have recently been concluded.  A new 250 m bypass canal and new road bridge to provide navigation around the existing road bridge serving Derrykerrib Island, which had insufficient head height for navigation, have now been constructed. Waterways Ireland continues to work with Cavan County Council to develop recreational amenities at Castle Saunderson including public moorings. </p><p>Waterways Ireland anticipates expenditure of c. &euro;154,000 in 2019 to complete payment for works at Derrykerrib and for construction works for Castle Saunderson public moorings.</p><p>In May 2018, this Government approved Phase 2, the development of a 13 km section of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne to Clones as a water sports and leisure amenity, and re-committed to developing this cross-border stretch under the Project Ireland 2040 plan, in the category of <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage</i>.</p><p>An application has been submitted by Waterways Ireland and partners Monaghan County Council, Cavan County Council and Fermanagh and Omagh District Council to the Department of Rural and Community Development for further funding under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund for this second phase of development.  </p><p>Waterways Ireland is also continuing work with partners Monaghan County Council, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, East Border Region Ltd. and Mid Ulster District Council to develop 22 km of Ulster Canal towpath between Smithborough, Co. Monaghan and Middletown, Co. Armagh funded through successful application to the Interreg VA sustainable transport measure.  The group have also completed development proposals for a Greenway strategy exploring how the Ulster Canal Greenway could form the spine of a network of off road greenways across this rural border region.</p></reply>
