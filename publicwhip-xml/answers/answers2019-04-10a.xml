    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-10a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041000069#WRA00700"><p>The statutory provisions relating to the use or possession of detection devices for archaeological purposes, and in relation to discoveries of archaeological objects generally, are set out in the National Monuments Acts.  </p>  <p>  While it is unlawful to be in possession of, or to use, a detection device on any monument site protected under those Acts without Ministerial consent under section 2 of the 1987 National Monuments (Amendment) Act, such consent is only otherwise needed where the device is being used for the express purpose of searching for archaeological objects.  Therefore, where a person using a detection device other than to search for archaeological objects finds such an object and complies with the legal requirement to report it to the National Museum, they would not have committed an offence under the National Monuments Acts. In summary, if an archaeological object is discovered by chance, provided the find is reported as required, no offence would be committed.   </p>  <p>  I do want to emphasise, however, that unregulated and inappropriate use of metal detectors does cause serious and irreparable damage to Ireland&rsquo;s archaeological heritage.  Unsupervised recovery of archaeological objects can greatly diminish, and could entirely eliminate, any research value that might be gained from a particular discovery.  Archaeological objects must be excavated in a structured scientific manner, with careful recording of their association with other objects, structures, features and soil layers.</p>  <p>  I believe that the Deputy would support me in wanting to retain a system where important cultural heritage material found in the State belongs to the people and is not liable to fall into private ownership and that he would back the existing legislative framework rather than seeking to introduce changes that would be inappropriate to the circumstances as they exist in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I consider the present legislative framework, and the manner in which it is implemented, to be reasonable, proportionate and essential to preventing irreparable loss and damage to our national heritage. Therefore, I have no proposals to make any changes to the law as it applies to the use of metal detecting devices.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-10a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041000069#WRA01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 23 together.</p>  <p>  In December 2014, the Government decided that Ireland should exercise its right to nominate a European Capital of Culture for 2020 and committed in principle at that time to provide &euro;15m to the selected project. Galway's designation as European Capital of Culture 2020, is a great honour for Ireland and a wonderful opportunity to strengthen and promote our culture nationally and internationally. It is particularly important in ever changing circumstances that Ireland uses this opportunity well to celebrate the creativity of Galway, on the periphery of Europe and mark Ireland's place in this important EU led celebrations of culture.</p>  <p>  The Government's support of &euro;15m represents the largest single contribution to the overall cost of Galway 2020 as the European Capital of Culture.  The Government's contribution is provided under the terms of a Performance Delivery Agreement setting out the respective roles and responsibilities of the Department and Galway 2020 in the provision and expenditure of the grant, the key deliverables and performance indicators attached to the drawdown of the grant. </p>  <p>  In addition to the funding being granted by my Department the other key partners are Galway City Council and Galway County Council who have guaranteed a minimum of &euro;6m and &euro;2m respectively. </p>  <p>  A full breakdown of Galway 2020&rsquo;s income and expenditure is publicly available on the website and reported to my Department on a quarterly basis as part of our performance delivery agreement.</p>  <p>  A large scale fundraising drive is underway.  Galway 2020&rsquo;s fundraising team is engaging with local, national and international businesses very positively and effectively.  It is understood that the process to negotiate and agree packages with fundraising partners takes time to finalise for each individual business and Galway 2020 are of course anxious to ensure that both sides get the same level of satisfaction from the partnership.</p>  <p>  As is normal for projects of this scale, it is envisaged that the fundraising drive will continue throughout 2019, into and during 2020, with funding realised throughout the entire duration of the project.</p>  <p>  In line with the terms of the Performance Delivery Agreement, regular monitoring meetings are held between my Department, Galway 2020 and Galway City Council and Galway County Council, as the other main stakeholders,</p>  <p>  Galway 2020&rsquo;s ambition is to deliver an artistic and cultural programme that will exceed expectations and leave a lasting legacy for Galway city and county.  In January 2019, Artichoke, under the leadership of Helen Marriage was appointed to deliver the Creative Leadership role for the project.  Having masterminded many large and unique cultural events, spectacles and arts performances, this expertise and creativity will be brought to bear in an imaginative programme for Galway 2020.</p>  <p>  As Galway 2020 is moving into the delivery phase of the Capital of Culture, it is signing contracts with organisations, artists and performers for the performances and events that they will hold under the overall delivery programme.  The programme continues to evolve as Galway 2020 has this week announced an exciting open call for communities to develop projects for inclusion in</p>  <p>  the cultural programme for Galway 2020, European Capital of Culture. </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;200,000 will be awarded by Galway 2020 across the successful</p>  <p>  community groups to create and deliver thrilling projects that could transform</p>  <p>  their communities.  These projects will form will form an integral part of</p>  <p>  the cultural programme for 2020</p>  <p>  At an organisational level, a number of changes have taken place over the past year. The company is now led by Patricia Philbin, formerly of Galway City Council, who had a direct role in the bid book phase and recent appointments to the Board include Arthur Lappin as Chair. In addition, the securing of the cultural production company Artichoke. Artichoke who has a proven track record in programming, funding and audience development, has given the project important cultural leadership.  </p>  <p>  While aspects of these changes gave rise to some local concerns during the initial bedding down stage, I believe that it is now timely for all to work within the timeframe to assist in delivering what is being designed an exciting and innovative programme for 2020 in Galway.</p>  <p>  The first of the monitoring meetings was held with the company in February when officials from my Department met with the Chief Executives of Galway City Council and Galway County Council, and separately with the senior management team in Galway 2020 to discuss progress on all key aspects of the project. All parties are working together to achieve the best possible programme in 2020.</p>  <p>  To date funding has been paid to Galway 2020 toward certified expenditure incurred on the research and development phase for 27 projects that will comprise the key deliverables under the culture programme for Galway 2020. This expenditure is in line with the terms of the performance delivery agreement, which aligns Department funding to the successful delivery of the cultural projects concerned.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that the Government funding will be rolled out on the basis of &euro;6 million in 2019   and the remainder of the Government committed funding will flow over 2020 and 2021. I believe this level of support with additional funding by other public and private partners will deliver an ambitious and exciting first-class programme for Galway 2020 as European Capital of Culture.</p>  <p>  Preparations for Galway as European Capital of Culture 2020 are progressing apace. I understand that the Galway 2020 team is working hard to deliver an artistic and cultural programme that will exceed expectations and leave a lasting legacy for the city and county of Galway and Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland is not unique in having personnel changes during the planning and delivery phase of a European Capital of Culture. What is important now that structures and personnel are in place, is that the public funding commitment to Galway 2020 is used to maximum impact to show globally that Galway and Ireland are a place of creativity, innovation and an exciting programme is on offer for all to experience.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-10a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041000069#WRA01500"><p>My Department issued one permit in 2012 under the Wildlife Acts to Coillte to remove a maximum of tens hares from their lands in Co Carlow as they were causing damage to red oak trees.    The hares were captured by means of nets and released back into the wild onto lands in agreement with officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.   </p>  <p>   This permit was granted under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts which offers a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual species on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.  Such applications are considered very carefully, are evidence based, and involve scientific input, as appropriate  The vast majority of these permits are issued for deer species. </p>  <p>  I have no evidence to suggest that hares have been captured on Coillte lands for hare coursing meetings.  The licence that my Department issues to the Irish Coursing Club to capture hares specifies that landowner permission is required of the owner or occupier of the land in question.  I am not aware if Coillte, or any other State body for that matter, would have given permission to coursing clubs to capture hares on their lands for use at coursing meetings.</p>  <p>  I would add that in 2014 members of a coursing club were found by officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Departmental capturing hares on Departmental lands in Boora, Co. Offaly without the Department&rsquo;s permission.  My Department took prosecutions against a number of club individuals and a number of them were subsequently fined in court.     </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Deputy has raised the issue of the monitoring of coursing meetings on a number of occasions.  Officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Services of my Department have monitored some thirty five coursing events during the 2018/19 season which ended at the end of February.  During the previous 2017/18 season, 35 coursing events were monitored while during the 2016/17 season a total of 17 coursing events were monitored by my Department.  Veterinary surgeons of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also monitor meetings.</p></reply>

Details of these projects are available on my Department's website and on local authority websites.  </p><p>The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is designed to leverage private capital for investment in a significant number of labour-intensive, small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled and experienced conservation professionals, craftspeople and tradespersons in the repair of the historic built environment. The scheme helps with the repair and conservation of structures that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts or within Architectural Conservation Areas. It is administered by local authorities. </p><p>Under the Built Heritage Investment Scheme, local authorities assess the applications before sending them to my Department for approval. My Department does not request the total number of applications received by the local authority. In 2019, 13 projects proposed by Kildare County Council were approved under Built Heritage Investment Scheme to the value of &euro;79,000, an increase of 58% over 2018.  </p><p><b>Built Heritage Investment Scheme &ndash; Kildare</b><b>2019 </b><table><tr><th>Name and Address of Structure</th><th>Grant  </th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Church of Ireland Kilberry</td><td>&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td>St. Michaels Church, Athy</td><td>&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Johnstown Graveyard &amp;amp; Church, Johnstown </td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sean Chill, Donaghcumper, Celbridge</td><td>&euro;3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Church of the Holy Saviour Narraghmore</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Ard Na Greine, Canal View, Sallins</td><td>&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td>7 Canning Place, Newbridge </td><td>&euro;8,000</td></tr><tr><td>Leixlip Boathouse, Leixlip</td><td>&euro;8,000</td></tr><tr><td>Pebble Hill House, Maynooth</td><td>&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Riverstown House, Kildangan</td><td>&euro;10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Grattan Vault, Tea Lane Graveyard, Celbridge</td><td>&euro;3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mill Cottage, Millicent Sth, Sallins</td><td>&euro;4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Thatch cottage Tomastown</td><td>&euro;5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;79,000</td></tr></table></p><p>The Historic Structures Fund is for conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership. The primary focus of the Historic Structures Fund is on conservation and enhancement of historic structures and buildings for the benefit of communities and the public. The fund is generally administered through the local authorities who prepare a shortlist of applications and each one can send a maximum of three private and one public project forward for assessment by my Department. </p><p>Grants under Stream One of the Historic Structures Fund are for amounts of between &euro;15,000 and &euro;50,000. Under Stream Two a small number of larger grants, up to &euro;200,000, was also available for historic structures in private and public ownership. </p><p>Kildare County Council indicated they had received 9 applications under the Historic Structures Fund in 2019, of which 3 were put forward to the Department for consideration. Following assessment, one project, Newbridge College Clock Town (Junior House) was approved in County Kildare to the value of &euro;25,000.</p></reply>

The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President in December, should improve the situation of insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours. </p>  <p>  It provides for a requirement that employers provide employees with certain terms of employment within a certain period after commencing employment; to impose sanctions for certain offences; to further provide for a minimum payment due to employees in certain circumstances; to prohibit contracts specifying zero as the contract hours in certain circumstances and to provide for the introduction of banded contract hours; to further provide for prohibition of penalisation and for those purposes to amend the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997; to amend the Workplace Relations Act 2015; and to provide for related matters.  </p>  <p>  The Finance Act 2018 made changes to Section 481 the film tax relief and the Revenue Commissioners made the Film Regulations 2019 to give effect to these changes on 27 March 2019.  The new Regulations include a signed undertaking in respect of quality employment which requires both the producer company and the qualifying company to comply with all obligations in the field of environmental, social and employment law.  The producer company and the qualifying company must be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer, have in place written policies and procedures in on Grievances, Discipline and Dignity at work (including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity).  The companies are also required to provide details of any Work Place Relations Commission decisions aligned with confirmation that any findings against the companies have been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work through the Audiovisual High Level Steering Group to address issues raised in the audiovisual industry, and to support the industry and the people who work in it.</p></reply>

Yet, they are also actively managed to promote a balanced relationship between people and nature; conservation on the one hand, and sustainable economic development and human activity on the other hand. Another important goal of biospheres is promoting research and learning.</p>  <p>  Biospheres or biosphere reserves were established under UNESCO&rsquo;s Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme launched in 1971. Places are awarded Biosphere Reserve Status by UNESCO but are managed in partnership by communities, NGOs and local and national governments. </p>  <p>  The EuroMAB 2019 conference was hosted by Dublin Bay Biosphere from Tuesday 2nd April to Friday, 5th April.  This conference was a biennial four-day conference for stakeholders from 302 UNESCO Biospheres in 36 countries across Europe and North America.  The conference welcomed practitioners, managers, policy-makers, researchers, educators, ecologists, scientists, social entrepreneurs, creative and community leaders. Ireland sits on the Steering Group of the Man and Biosphere Programme, and is represented by Dublin Bay Biosphere.</p>  <p>  To support sustainable development, UNESCO&rsquo;s concept of a Biosphere has since evolved to include not just areas of ecological value but also the areas around them and the communities that live and work within these areas. Reflecting its significant environmental, economic, cultural and tourism importance.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has two designated UNESCO Biospheres. These are Dublin Bay and Kerry Biosphere Reserve. They were originally designated in the early 1980s. The Department (represented by the National Parks and Wildlife Service) is the national focal point for Biospheres under UNESCO and is a partner to both Biospheres.</p>  <p>  Development within Biospheres is subject to an existing comprehensive legislative and policy planning framework implemented by all levels of government.  Biospheres are an internationally recognised designation which does not alter these existing frameworks.  Biosphere Partnerships are not a planning reference body involved in land use planning deliberations or discussions.  While they remain neutral on individual developments, a Biosphere Partnership may make information available to inform evidence-based discussion, where appropriate. There are no additional planning burdens as a consequence of biosphere designations but in some cases areas are already designated as SAC/SPA and in the case of Kerry, contain National Park land so are already afforded protection. </p>  <p>  The original biosphere designation in Kerry centred on Killarney National Park. Since 2017 my Department has funded works within Killarney National Park in the region of over &euro;1.5m  and refurbished Killarney House and Gardens as an interpretative centre for the Core Area of the Biosphere. My Department is not the anchor component of the Dublin Bay Biosphere. It has  provided significant professional and expert support through the NPWS and it also provides small amounts of project funding from time to time. Circa &euro;30K has been provided in the last two years.</p>  <p>  Through its ten year capital plan for investment, Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027, my Department has committed to safeguarding our unique natural heritage and biodiversity and ensure a sustainable future.  We intend to celebrate and highlight Ireland&rsquo;s remarkable heritage on the international stage through investment in the management of our UNESCO Biosphere reserves.</p></reply>

Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including particular structures on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS).   </p>  <p>  The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) was established by the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1999. Its purpose is to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland as an aid in its protection.  </p>  <p>  As Minister, I can make recommendations to planning authorities for buildings and structures to be included on the Record of Protected Structures and these recommendations arise from the survey of the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH). Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. The final decision as to inclusion of a building or structure on the RPS, however, is a reserved function of the relevant planning authority.  </p>  <p>  The surveys are also a research and educational resource which, it is hoped, will increase public awareness, understanding, and appreciation of the post-1700 architectural heritage in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The NIAH does not take the physical condition of a building into consideration when selecting and recording sites, structures or buildings of architectural heritage significance.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 defines architectural heritage as structures or parts of structures which are of Architectural, Historical, Archaeological, Artistic, Cultural, Scientific, Social or Technical interest.  The Categories of Special Interest can be seen as a list of criteria to be considered when evaluating a structure. The categories are not mutually exclusive and a structure may be attributed with several of the categories.  The Act makes no reference to physical condition as a means of evaluating the significance of a site, structure or building.</p>  <p>  The NIAH records a broad range of buildings, including those which are fully habitable and in use, as well as derelict houses and ruined castles.  Most NIAH records are made through a visual, exterior only, inspection.   A physical condition evaluation is an entirely different function and should only be undertaken by a suitably qualified historic buildings professional who has full access to all aspects of the relevant site, structure or building, including the interior, attic and basement spaces, as applicable.</p></reply>

Funding allocations for local authorities over the coming years will be considered as part of the annual estimates budgetary processes.</p></reply>

As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils, and these rulings were published in Revenue&rsquo;s VAT rates database. The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector, and this is reflected in Revenue&rsquo;s correspondence with taxpayers involved in this business and their agents, in its discussions with the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA) and in the content of its VAT rates database.</p>  <p>  In the operation of this concessionary treatment, it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated, resulting in a situation in which elements in the industry and certain agents aggressively pursued zero rating of all kinds of products, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover, build muscle and reduce stress. These businesses consistently challenged Revenue guidance and Revenue decisions on the VAT rating of products giving rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  The IHTA raised concerns with Revenue about the difficulties in distinguishing between food supplement products which could be zero rated and those which should be standard rated. In response, Revenue undertook a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements and engaged an expert to advise on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, 2010. Based on the expert advice and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. </p>  <p>  I decided not to introduce any legislative changes at that time but as the Deputy may be aware I have committed to putting in place a consultation process to help me identify the policy options in relation to VAT on food supplements and will publish the conclusions in the Tax Strategy Papers later this year. I envisage seeking input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, to ensure that any legislative changes I bring forward are evidence based, and I will consult with my colleague the Minister for Health in this regard.  Details on the public consultation will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

The system of recording was changed and exact figures for the individual months are not available. </p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the number of applications awaiting processing and approval, Revenue have provided me with the following data on the number of applications under EII which are currently in progress as of March 2019, the most recent month for which data are available. These figures include applications received to date in 2019. </p><p><b>Table 4: No. of applications for EII Scheme in progress 2019</b><table><tr><th>YEAR</th><th>QUALIFYING COMPANIES</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>102</td></tr></table></p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the average time taken between original application and the final approval, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to give an average time taken to issue a decision regarding approval or rejection. Applications received have varying levels of complexity, some will take longer to carry out the level of examination required than others. Equally, where a full application, with all supporting documentation, is received a decision will issue more quickly than a case where additional information and clarifications must be sought.  Currently, over 80% of applications received require follow-on correspondence before a determination can issue. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a review of the EII scheme was carried out and substantial changes to the operational design of the scheme were implemented in Finance Act 2018.  The design of the scheme has been amended such that it may now be claimed in the same was as other similar tax reliefs on a self-assessment basis. Accordingly, for all investments in qualifying companies from 1 January 2019 there is no longer a requirement to receive prior certification from Revenue. For investments made up to and including 31 December 2018 Revenue certification is still required.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the number of outstanding applications for tax relief certificates under EII awaiting processing and approval by the Revenue Commissioners at the end of each month in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, Revenue have provided me with the following data:</p><p><b>Table 5: 2016 Total Applications Outstanding</b><table><tr><th>MONTH</th><th>QUALIFYING COMPANIES</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>35</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 6: 2017 Total Applications Outstanding</b><table><tr><th>MONTH</th><th>QUALIFYING COMPANIES</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>164</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>186</td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>277</td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>189</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>187</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 7: 2018 Total Applications In Progress </b><table><tr><th>MONTH</th><th>QUALIFYING COMPANIES</th></tr><tr><td>January</td><td>226</td></tr><tr><td>February</td><td>251</td></tr><tr><td>March</td><td>261</td></tr><tr><td>April</td><td>289</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>294</td></tr><tr><td>June</td><td>281</td></tr><tr><td>July</td><td>293</td></tr><tr><td>August</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>September</td><td>257</td></tr><tr><td>October</td><td>261</td></tr><tr><td>November</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>December</td><td>115</td></tr></table></p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that figures prior to August 2017 (Table 5 and Table 6 above) represent unworked items only (i.e. where no processing had yet taken place), while those after August 2017 include items in respect of which a final answer had not yet issued. Therefore, a file was not identified as outstanding in July 2017 where correspondence was sent to a taxpayer requesting more information and that information was still awaited at the end of the month. That file, from August 2017, is identified as an outstanding work item. These changes in the recording of the statistics, which allowed for a more accurate representation of the level of the work outstanding, account for the large spike in the numbers in the latter part of 2017. </p><p>Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is continuing to look at the scheme in conjunction with Revenue, and in consultation with other stakeholders, with a view to ensuring that it operates efficiently and effectively.</p></reply>

Thus, NDP gives a very clear signal of Government's long term capital spending plans.</p>  <p>  While my Department sets the capital allocations for Departments and the delegated sanction arrangements under which Departments make their spending decisions, the actual roll-out of particular capital projects and programmes is, of course, managed by the individual line Departments and their agencies who are responsible for project and programme delivery. </p>  <p>  As the NDP states, each Government Department is responsible for ensuring that its proposed projects meet with appropriate regulatory requirements including those related to planning law and environmental impact assessments. Departments must also ensure that individual projects and investment proposals meet all of the relevant appraisal processes and value-for-money tests required under the Public Spending Code, before Exchequer resources are ultimately expended on</p>  <p>  the relevant projects. Individual Departments also have the obligation to manage any multi-annual contractual commitments within the terms of their sanction.</p></reply>

This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. </p><p>The Government decision confirmed that a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions to be eligible for assistance under this scheme, including:</p><p>- That floodwater entered and damaged the building during or as a result of flooding during relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable.</p><p>- That the property was the homeowner&rsquo;s primary residence at the time of the floods.</p><p>- That the affected property must have a significant probability of the recurrence of the flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could cause further serious and similar damage to the home.</p><p>- That the property is not due to or may not benefit from a planned or possible future major, minor or individual flood defence scheme.</p><p>- That the property may not be protected adequately from being flooded in the future, at an economically feasible cost, through other flood mitigation works including minor works, individual property protection or other possible measures that can be considered at this time.</p><p>- That the homeowner is unable to obtain flood risk insurance.</p><p>A total of 169 properties were identified by the local authorities and the direct Expressions of Interest as being potentially eligible to apply.

The issues involved, relate primarily to laboratory interior finishes and mechanical and electrical adjustments.  </p>  <p>   On completion of this examination it was possible to re-invite tenders from the shortlist of building contractors for the new State Forensics Laboratory in Q4 2018 with a closing date for submissions of 29 March 2019. Due to the complex nature of this project it was necessary to extend the tender return date until May 2019.  Tender assessment will then take place during Q3 2019. On completion of the assessment and following the statutory standstill period it is envisaged that construction could commence in Q3/4 2019. When the construction contract for the main building is placed, the estimated construction period is 24 months followed by a validation and test period prior to occupation.</p></reply>

There are currently 8 universities in the State, the most recent being the establishment of Technological University Dublin under the Technological Universities Act 2018 on 1 January 2019.  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 states that there is no case for the establishment of any new universities in Ireland on the basis set out in Section 9 of the Universities Act 1997.  The National Strategy states that smaller, stand-alone institutions such as individual Institutes of Technology (IoTs) lack the scale required to deliver necessary advances in quality and efficiency. Universities and IoTs are encouraged to work together collaboratively in regional clusters. </p><p>The strategy also recommended consolidation within the IoT sector and a pathway of evolution for consolidated IoTs to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against stated performance criteria and to become multi-campus technological universities (TUs). Government policy as set out in the Programme for Government is to support the creation of TUs as higher education institutes (HEIs) of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to have a significant impact at regional, national and international level. These regional HEIs will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on the capacity to create and retain jobs in regions. As such, Government will prioritise those institutions which have clear ambitions and plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education. </p><p>The Government has provided the enabling legislation in the Technological Universities Act 2018 for two or more IoTs to come together to seek TU status. The Technological Universities Act 2018 which was signed into law on 19 March 2018 provides the legal framework underpinning the process for establishment by two or more IoTs as a TU subject to a decision-making process contingent on the meeting of specified eligibility criteria and including assessment by an international advisory panel. The 2018 Act also sets out the functions and governance requirements for these new HEIs. Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by two or more institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU. Section 38 of the Act provides that an institution and an established TU may also apply to the Minister for such an order.</p><p>Government also continues to support those consortia of IoTs seeking to achieve TU status under the legislation in terms of significant Exchequer co-funding, with the latest funding call for a total of &euro;14 million in respect of TU development and other higher education landscape restructuring projects having issued from the Higher Education Authority on 29 March 2019. </p><p>The potential benefits of becoming a successful TU are significant in terms of increased reach, international recognition, research capacity building, FDI attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experience and opportunities and socio-economic progression. The merging of institutes of technology will create institutions of sufficient size, capacity and critical mass to maximise those benefits and attract greater investment. </p><p>TUs will be distinguished by a mission and ethos that is aligned and consistent with the current mission and focus of IoTs with an emphasis on programmes at Levels 6 to 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), industry focused research and the development and use of new knowledge through industry-focused research. However, TUs will also offer post-graduate programmes at Levels 9 and 10 on the NFQ. </p><p>TUs will help retain talent in the regions by strengthening the offer available to students who will be able to continue to masters and postgraduate level, including PhDs. Larger management and academic teams permitted by the merger of institutions will increase institutional capacity and will facilitate enhanced performance in areas such as winning research funding. </p><p>TUs will also be expected to play a pivotal role in facilitating access and progression particularly through relationships with the further education and training sector. The presence of a technological university in a region, with a specific mandate for promoting regional development, will have a transformative effect on local and regional communities. By creating institutions of increased scale and capacity, multi-campus TUs will bring greater social and economic benefits to their regions through a strengthened role in research and innovation and the delivery of a broad range of high quality education and training in each of their campuses. </p><p>It is clear from the progress made with existing consortia and from international exemplars that there is very considerable coherence in sectoral and educational offerings that make a single HEI hub both a catalyst and a magnet for regional economic development and employment. The strong regional mission of TUs to support development and innovation is aligned with the objectives of Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework. Enhanced HEIs will deliver the skilled and talented people that sustain enterprise and new investments.<b></b>The National Development Plan 2018 - 2027 cites as a priority the establishment of a clearly prioritised Exchequer-supported higher education building programme including the objective of bolstering the capacity of multi-campus TUs. The current TU development consortia are referenced under Project Ireland 2040 as having a role in deepening the talent pool for distinctive regional clusters and driving research and innovation. TUs will also be well placed to attract increased research funding and to bid for a share of the &euro;4 billion in funding available as part of Project Ireland 2040 over the period 2019 &ndash; 2027 under the four broad themes of rural development, urban development, climate action and disruptive technology. </p><p>On 1 January 2019 the first TU in the State, Technological University Dublin, which formerly comprised Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown and Institute of Technology Tallaght, was established under the Technological Universities Act 2018. With some 28,000 students, Technological University Dublin became the largest HEI in the State. </p><p>On 12 February 2019 the Munster Technological University consortium, comprising Cork IT and IT Tralee, submitted an application to the Minister for Education and Skills seeking TU status under the 2018 Act. The relevant legislative procedures under the Act are in train in relation to the assessment and decision- making process in relation to this application. </p><p>There are two other consortia of IoTs working to develop TU proposals. These are the Technological University for South East Ireland consortium, comprising Waterford IT and IT Carlow, and the Connacht Ulster Alliance, comprising IT Sligo, Galway Mayo IT and Letterkenny IT. These consortia are understood to be working toward the submission of applications for TU designation under the 2018 Act in 2019 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>Currently four IoTs - Athlone, Dundalk and Limerick - and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art Design and Technology - have not joined or formed a consortium seeking to develop TU proposals. Athlone IoT had previously considered joining a TU development consortium but to date has not chosen to do so.</p><p>It remains at the discretion of each individual IoT whether or not it chooses to join an existing consortium, or to form a new consortium, of institutes to progress together towards making an application for TU status under the 2018 Act.  It is also a matter for the relevant IoTs in a consortium to lead on the progression of their plans to seek designation as a TU under the Technological Universities Act 2018 subject to their individual circumstances.</p></reply>

I will address these, prior to outlining the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process. </p><p>My Department understands that a representative of the Archdiocese of Dublin wrote to schools in the Portmarnock, Malahide, Kinsealy and Yellow Walls areas on 5 April last in relation to the consultation that had been undertaken by the Archdiocese with a number of schools under its patronage in these areas.  I understand that this correspondence indicates that any vote which may have been planned by the schools involved should be postponed, pending the publication of the Identification Phase report for this area as part of the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process. My Department intends to publish the Identification Phase reports in the first half of this year.</p><p>For clarity, I wish to confirm that in relation to the phase 1 pilot areas, including Malahide/Portmarnock, the Implementation Phase of the process has not yet commenced.  </p><p>Prior to the letter issuing on the 5<sup>th</sup>of April, I understand that representatives of the Dublin Archdiocese had been holding meetings with a number of primary schools under their patronage in the Malahide and Portmarnock area to provide information to them on the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process.  Letters/leaflets received by parents were not based on information provided by my Department.  These letters and leaflets contained incorrect information which led to unnecessary confusion. At no stage did the Department seek to impose any artificial deadline on this process  and there has never been a requirement for any transfer of patronage to take place in September 2019.</p><p>Transfer of patronage and consultation with school communities on Reconfiguration is a matter for the current patron (i.e. the Dublin Archdiocesan representatives in the case of the schools under Catholic patronage in Malahide and Portmarnock) in the first instance.  Any concerns or views that parents have in relation to such events should be discussed with the school patron. My Department, as part of this process, is not involved in the selection of any school for reconfiguration. </p><p>In relation to the Schools Reconfiguration process, as Deputies are aware, the Programme for Government includes a commitment of reaching 400 multi-/non-denominational schools in Ireland by the year 2030. The Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is aimed at assisting in achieving this target by transferring existing schools from denominational to multi-/non-denominational patronage in line with the wishes of the school community. </p><p>The process is composed of two separate and distinct phases - the Identification Phase and the subsequent Implementation Phase. The first Identification Phase of the phase 1 pilot process is nearing completion for 16 initial areas nationwide.</p><p><b>Identification Phase</b></p><p>In the Identification Phase, each of the country&rsquo;s 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district where they consider, based on census data and local knowledge, there is likely to be an oncoming demand for more diversity of patronage within the local educational provision. Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB, while initially having selected Skerries, subsequently revised its selection to Malahide and Portmarnock. </p><p>Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs. Template documents were supplied in relation to the surveys. ETBs, having analysed the survey results, then draw up comprehensive reports detailing the outcomes of the surveys in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron/landowner in the area, which is the Catholic Bishop or Archbishop in most cases, concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand. </p><p>The response of the Bishop to any identified oncoming demand for greater diversity of school patronage in the area is included in the report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department, which will publish the reports on its website, www.education.ie. Not all of the Identification Phase reports from these 16 initial areas have been finalised. It is envisaged that the reports will be published in the first half of this year. </p><p><b>Implementation Phase</b></p><p>Following the publication of the first round of reports, it is intended that the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process will move into the Implementation Phase.</p><p>It is intended that the Implementation Phase would involve the existing patron of the majority of schools in each area, i.e., the relevant Catholic Archbishop or Bishop, consulting with their local school communities on accommodating the oncoming demand for a greater diversity of patronage among the schools in their area. </p><p>In the Implementation Phase, the existing patron (the Catholic Archbishop/Bishop), would identify a school to transfer to a multi-denominational or non-denominational patron (where the Identification Phase report has shown a viable level of demand for greater diversity of patronage). </p><p>The process envisages that the identification of a new multi-denominational or non-denominational patron should reflect the wishes of parents and the school community.  It will be up to the relevant school patron (i.e. the Catholic Archbishop/Bishop) to discuss with their school communities the choices that could be made.  </p><p>It is also envisaged that the existing patron would provide information to parents on the multi-denominational/non-denominational options available and engage in a consultative process with the school community.For example, the existing patron may wish to arrange a meeting where prospective patrons could provide information to the school community. </p><p>Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing. </p><p>I recently had a very constructive meeting with Irish Episcopal Conference representatives in relation to a number of matters including Reconfiguration. The Bishops reiterated their commitment to the Reconfiguration process. Further engagement is planned in this regard and I look forward to working positively with the Bishops on this matter in a spirit of continued partnership.</p><p>There are also a number of instances where school communities directly engaged their patron and sought a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron.  For example, the &lsquo;early movers&rsquo; provision fast-tracks patronage reassignment.  The first 'early mover' reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017.  Any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; provision should contact their school patron directly.</p></reply>

The records held by these bodies represent the personal testimony and stories of many survivors of residential institutional child abuse and a range of related papers.   This information was provided by these survivors on the understanding that the records would be destroyed.  I believe that these historically important but extremely sensitive records should not be destroyed but should be retained so as to ensure that future generations will be aware of and understand what happened in institutions and out of respect to the victims who came forward. </p>  <p>  The legislation under which the three bodies in question currently operate restricts the application of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts and the Data Protection Act. The Retention of Records Bill provides for the continuation of that dis-application in the case of the Freedom of Information Act. If the Bill is enacted and the records are transferred to the National Archives, further processing will be for archiving purposes and the provisions of section 61 of the Data Protection Act 2018 will therefore apply.</p>  <p>  The proposals contained in the Bill were the subject of normal consultations with other Government departments both at the time the General Scheme of the Bill was finalised in early 2015 and more recently when the text of the Bill was approved for publication.  I can confirm that informal discussions took place with the Data Protection Commissioner.  </p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS is organised in eight Regions with and including some 23 offices nationally providing service to the schools in their respective catchment areas. All mainstream schools in Co. Kildare receive a service from NEPS psychologists based in the Naas Office.</p>  <p>  NEPS recruits its psychologists from Regional panels of suitably qualified personnel put in place by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) following a national recruitment competition.

Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements.</p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published on December 2016. Second Stage (D&aacute;il) took place on 31 January and 1 February 2017, and Committee Stage on 30 January 2019. </p>  <p>  The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.</p>  <p>  The monitoring framework will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority (NDA) and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. The IHREC Act 2014 was designed to ensure that IHREC, as Ireland&rsquo;s National Human Rights Institution, fully meets the standard of independence in accordance with the Paris Principles.</p>  <p>  Heads of Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty are being progressed by my colleague the Minister for Health.  A report of a recent public consultation on draft legislative provisions is nearing completion.  Every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p>  <p>  This report has been completed and was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018.  Preparation of the report involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report was informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. </p>  <p>  The report was informed by the personal experiences and concerns of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery, including through written representations to me and my Department, those concerns raised in Parliamentary Questions on this subject, and the issues raised by the Mesh Survivors Ireland group at its meeting with me on 14 June 2018. I acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown by the women I met and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were often harrowing, deeply personal experiences.</p>  <p>  The priority issues relating to patient care which were raised by women suffering complications and by others on their behalf are addressed in the report recommendations and are being addressed by the HSE.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, were not formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, a number of women whose procedures were postponed wrote to me and my Department expressing concern at the impact that this is having on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.</p>  <p>  The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p>  <p>   The Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p>  <p>  - the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p>  <p>  - surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p>  <p>  - the development of clinical guidance;</p>  <p>  - the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p>  <p>  - ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p>  <p>  - ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p>  <p>  In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented.</p>  <p>  A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  The Group includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. The HSE has advised that it is unable to facilitate membership on the Advisory Group to every patient or patient group who has a mesh experience. The NWIHP has sought to have a range of mesh experiences from the patient&rsquo;s perspective represented by a patient advocate on the Group &ndash; including patients who have had mesh with post-operative problems, patients who have had successful mesh surgery and patients who are on the waiting list for a mesh procedure.  The HSE advises that women who wish to submit views or submissions to the overall work of the Group should contact the National Women and Infants Health Programme at smi.nwihp@hse.ie.</p>  <p>  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that many women have already engaged with this pathway system and have attended centres for second opinion and follow up appointments.  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website.</p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the HSE on November 27 2018 to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, to be approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website within three months of receipt of the report, or sooner if completed. It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the HSE has advised that the final version of the Implementation Plan will be published on its website and submitted to my Department in coming weeks. </p>  <p>  At my recent meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

Validation is the process whereby hospital administration contacts patients on waiting lists at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend a hospital appointment or wish to be removed. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the validation process allows for situations where, if requested by the GP/referring clinician, patients can be reinstated back to their original place on to the Waiting List.</p>  <p>  Last year, I approved the establishment of a Central Waiting List Validation Office within the NTPF. The new office delivers a standardisation of approach to validation across all waiting lists and all hospitals in line with the best patient-centred practices. The validation of waiting lists better informs the true demand for hospital services and enable improved efficiency and patient scheduling.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

According to data for Q4 2018 submitted by eir to my Department the company has passed almost 225,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment.</p><p>Information on eir's rural deployment is available on that company&rsquo;s website, .

The grants promote a fabric first approach &ndash; advising people to first reduce heat losses by installing insulation and ventilation, making it easier to keep a home warmer and more comfortable for longer periods, before moving to installation of new or renewable heating systems.    The individual measures that are currently funded were selected for inclusion as they were deemed most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners, at least relative cost, and would thereby optimise the use of Exchequer funds while at the same time maximising the opportunities for homeowner participation.</p>  <p>  The installation of wood burning stoves can be funded as part of a deeper energy efficiency upgrade &ndash; achieving an A3 Building Energy Rating - via the Deep Retrofit Programme or the Better Energy Communities scheme. Stoves installed must meet certain requirements and the specification is available on SEAI&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Energy Efficiency Obligation scheme requires all energy suppliers above a certain threshold to work with their customers to deliver energy savings. The replacement of an open fire with a solid fuel, biomass or gas fired room heater can save homeowners money and is an eligible measure under this scheme. Some suppliers offer their customers rebates for replacing open fires in their homes. If a customer would like to pursue this option they will need to contact their energy supplier directly or they can obtain more information from the SEAI. </p></reply>

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the decision of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide. Banning the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality and public health, particularly in built up areas. </p><p>I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. High levels of particulate matter arise from a number of sources, including the burning of smoky coal. </p><p>I have also asked the EPA for a report on air quality in areas not currently covered by the smoky coal ban.  This will provide important evidence which can assist in the development of this legally robust plan.</p><p>Pending the completion of this work I am aware of the need to provide clarity now to the public and to the trade to enable them adequately plan for purchases of stock for the 2019/20 heating season. I can confirm therefore that the current ban on bituminous coal will not be extended nationwide for the 2019/20 heating season.</p></reply>

If a person with the relevant truck or bus category on their UK licence attends at a National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) Centre without the relevant medical report, they will be given the option to sign a form stating that they do not wish the categories to be exchanged. The applicant can request the categories be re-instated on their Irish licence by presenting a medical report.</p>  <p>  Some UK categories known as &lsquo;National Categories&rsquo; [similar to our W Tractor] only apply in the UK and they are not exchangeable. For example, in the UK if a person passed their test for category B (car) before 1 January 1997, their licence would show entitlement to C1 and C1E (trucks) and D1 and D1E (bus) categories. These categories are given with restrictions identified by codes. </p>  <p>  The C1E category with a restriction code 107 on it entitles the driver to drive a C1E vehicle provided the combined weight of the trailer and the towing vehicle does not exceed 8.25 tonnes/kg. In Ireland the combined weight of the C1E is 12 tonne/kg. Therefore we do not have an equivalent to exchange this category for. The D1 and D1E categories with a restriction code like 101 or 119 only allow the driver to drive a vehicle if it is not for hire or reward. We do not have the corresponding category so cannot exchange it. </p></reply>

Regardless of when a review is conducted, where an increase in payment is due, the person's rate of payment will be adjusted without delay and arrears paid backdated to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  Where a person's rate does not increase following a review, the person will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.   </p>  <p>  Separately, the option remains for any pensioner who qualifies for a reduced rate contributory pension to apply for state pension (non-contributory).  This is a means-tested payment, based on the person's share of household means, where the maximum rate payable equates to 95% of the maximum rate of state pension (contributory).  Another option also remains, where a person's spouse or partner is in receipt of state pension (contributory), that person may wish to claim an increase in respect of their qualified adult.  This is also means-tested payment, based on the means of the person being claimed for, where the maximum rate is equal to 90% of the maximum rate of state pension (contributory).  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Inclusion Strategy is a cross-Departmental initiative to improve the lives of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  The development of the Strategy involved a comprehensive public consultation process, including two rounds of public meetings and engagement with Traveller organisations at national level.  Integral to the finalisation of the Inclusion Strategy was the work of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which has members from relevant Government Departments as well as Traveller and Roma representatives and advocates.</p>  <p>  Arising from the consultation process, ten key themes were identified as central to the success of the Inclusion strategy, and two of these relate most directly to employment.</p>  <p>  First, the Strategy recognises that &ldquo;there is a very large disparity between Travellers and non-Travellers in the level of education completed&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the labour market disadvantage of Travellers is largely linked to that educational disadvantage.&rdquo;  Accordingly, the Strategy identifies 14 different actions aimed at improving access, participation and outcomes for Travellers and Roma in education in order to achieve outcomes that are equal to those for the majority population.</p>  <p>  Employment and the Traveller Economy is also identified as a specific key theme in the strategy and it includes a range of relevant actions.  Within this range of actions, my Department and the Department of  and Skills is committed to delivering and supporting a range of assistive and targeted measures to increase employment, training and apprenticeship opportunities for Travellers and Roma over the long term by:</p>  <p>  - Promoting the availability of existing employment and training services to the Roma and Traveller communities and continuing to ensure promotional and information materials on its schemes are available and accessible via the Department&rsquo;s website. Work is underway to support transition of DEASP web content to the new Gov.ie website, with transition to begin in 2019.  All DEASP content on gov.ie will be in an easy-to-read, plain English format.    </p>  <p>  - Providing accessible literature on DEASP services. Three plain English booklets  &ndash; Families and Children, Retired and Older People,  Illness and Disability &ndash; are now finalised or nearing completion. Hard copies will be distributed to Traveller representatives for distribution to service users.     </p>  <p>  - Providing tailored supports for the long-term unemployed and for young people to build their confidence and prepare them for the workplace;</p>  <p>  - Developing targeted initiatives to increase Traveller and Roma engagement with employment and training services;</p>  <p>  - Providing Anti-racism and cultural awareness training for staff under the new shared Civil Service learning and development curriculum. </p>  <p>  - Ensuring that Travellers and Roma, under the age of 25, who register as unemployed claimants of Jobseekers&rsquo; payments engage with activation case officers on a monthly basis and receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within a period of four months of registering, in line with commitments under the Youth Guarantee.</p>  <p>  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy is a living document, with monitoring of its implementation a key and integral feature of its success.  This whole of Government approach is necessary to the achievement of meaningful change and enhanced employment prospects for Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.</p></reply>

It was subsequently extended to the acquisition and construction of properties by AHBs and facilitates delivery under the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF), the Mortgage to Rent Scheme (MTR), the Housing Agency Acquisitions Fund (HAA) and the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS). All P&amp;amp;A funding is underpinned by a P&amp;amp;A agreement, which is a template contractual arrangement between an AHB and a local authority setting out the terms under which AHBs make properties available to local authorities for the purpose of providing social housing support. </p><p>Under the Department&rsquo;s leasing programme and the RLS, AHBs lease dwellings from private owners, with local authorities providing funding under a P&amp;amp;A agreement to pay the lease payment due to the private owner. The payment to the owner may be up to 80% of market rent, or 85% in respect of apartments with management company service charges. The discount of up to 20% on market rent paid reflects the fact that the owner has no tenancy management or day to day maintenance responsibilities and is paid for vacant periods. Under the P&amp;amp;A agreement, the AHB is responsible for tenancy management and day to day maintenance of the property. Responsibility for structural maintenance and insurance remains with the owner. The AHB collects differential rent from the tenant, in its position as landlord under the Residential Tenancies Acts. This rent is determined by the relevant local authority's own rent scheme. </p><p>P&amp;amp;As are available to AHBs at a lower level of discount on market rent under the acquisitions and construction models supported by CALF, which includes the MTR scheme and the Housing Agency Fund. This lower discount acknowledges the increased level of risk and responsibility placed on the AHB as owner of the property, which includes mortgage or debt repayment, structural maintenance and ongoing and prudent asset management, including provision to a sinking fund. The payment under the P&amp;amp;A agreement in this case may be set at up to 92% of market rent, or 95% in the case of apartments with management company service charges.</p><p>The number of AHB P&amp;amp;A agreements commenced in 2018, as reported by local authorities, the average length of the agreements and the average monthly cost of the P&amp;amp;A recouped to local authorities by my Department under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) are set out in the table below. As has been clarified separately for the Deputy, P&amp;amp;A costs are not comparable to the payments arising under Social Housing PPP contracts.<table><tr><th>Delivery Stream</th><th>Total Delivered</th><th>Average Length </th><th>Average monthly P&amp;amp;A payment  </th></tr><tr><td>CALF/HAA</td><td>2,085 </td><td>28 years </td><td>&euro;1,028 </td></tr><tr><td>MTR</td><td>148 </td><td>29 years </td><td>&euro;780 </td></tr><tr><td>Leasing</td><td>264 </td><td>18 years </td><td>&euro;765 </td></tr><tr><td>RLS</td><td>2 </td><td>20 years </td><td>&euro;600 </td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2,499</td><td>27 years </td><td>&euro;972 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

This payment incorporates all costs under the contract, including the initial construction costs of the units, or what might be referred to as the pure "bricks and mortar" costs.  It also includes management and maintenance costs, such as the day-to-day upkeep of the properties, general facilities management, and tenancy management.</p>  <p>  Other costs covered by this payment under the contract include the costs of finance for the project, projected inflation over the 25 years of the contract's operational life, and the costs of complying with other terms of the contract, including that defined quality requirements are delivered upon when the homes involved are passed over to the local authorities concerned at the end of the 25 year contract period.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) is an essential part of any PPP project. It contains commercially sensitive information in relation to the methodology used for costing public sector projects and for the pricing of risks by public sector bodies.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have indicated that following the completion of the construction phase of a PPP, once an appropriate period of time has elapsed and the commercial sensitivity of the information on the project is no longer an issue (having regard also to any other similar PPP projects which may be in pre-procurement), the PSB should be made public. </p>  <p>  However, current policy is that the final PSB, or any elements thereof, is not made public during the tendering process, on the basis that revealing the amount that the State may pay for a service may give tenderers an opportunity to increase their asking price above what they might otherwise seek. This guidance also applies where it is intended to procure further similar projects in the near future.</p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing Social Housing PPP programme, tenders for Bundle 2 are currently being evaluated, and the process for Bundle 3 is due to commence shortly. While the PSB will be released in due course in accordance with the approach outlined above, it is not possible to release it at this time given the potential impact on value for money for the State for these future contracts.</p></reply>
