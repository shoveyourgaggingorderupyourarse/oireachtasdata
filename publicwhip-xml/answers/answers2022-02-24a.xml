This included representatives from disabled artists organisations and disabled artists. </p>  <p>  Following that forum, I held a public consultation throughout the month of January.  This public consultation closed three weeks ago and my Department received a significant number of submissions, reflecting the high level of interest in this new policy intervention. My officials are currently reviewing the submissions and a report on the consultation is currently being prepared which will be published in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The impact of such a scheme on artists with disabilities is a theme that has been raised throughout the consultation and I can assure the Deputy that it is a matter I take very seriously.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the report on the Cost of Disability to which the Deputy referred and which was commissioned by my colleague the Minister for Social Protection.  The findings of the research have implications for many areas of public policy including the delivery of care services, health, housing, education, transport and income supports.  The Government has referred the report on the Cost of Disability to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group. This Steering Group is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte.  All Departments have been asked to consider actions that are currently being implementing and any proposed new actions that they will be undertaking in the context of the findings of the Report. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the issue of artists will disabilities is something which I am focused on. I believe that the Basic Income for the Arts has the potential to help artists and creative arts workers with disabilities overcome labour market barriers by creating a self-sustaining creative practice, operating on a self-employed basis. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-24a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022400058#WRA01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 26 together.</p>  <p>  In relation to my Department's responsibilities, two schemes provide grant assistance to both local authorities and sporting organisations for the development and improvement of community playing fields, sports stadia and sports facilities generally.</p>  <p>  The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  Inevitably, the Programme is oversubscribed however, and it does not cover the purchase of land or buildings. Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising this investment in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the Programme closed for applications on 1 March 2021.  By this date, 3,106 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.   </p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>  The grants as announced included a significant number of allocations to local authorities for the improvement of playing pitches and to sporting organisations for improvements to their sports grounds. Details of all applications submitted under the 2020 round can be viewed on www.gov.ie. All valid capital applications received a grant offer and all allocations can also be viewed on a county basis on the same site.   </p>  <p>  All unsuccessful applicants will be able to appeal the Department's decision. When the appeals process is complete, a full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and any recommendations contained therein will be factored in to the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of the next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete. </p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department to Local Authorities and sporting organisations for the development and improvement of community playing fields, sports stadia and sports facilities under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The LSSIF is designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals.  Details of all grants, including those related to stadium improvements,  are published on the Gov.ie website. While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects, as it is now two years since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department has now met with all successful grantees and work is at an advanced stage in drafting the review. I expect this work to be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  Once that review is complete the scope for awarding any additional LSSIF grants, adjusting the level  of existing grants and the timing of any new call for proposals under the LSSIF will be considered.  </p>  <p>  In relation to contacts by sporting organisations, as the Deputy will be aware, the SCEP and the LSSIF are important to numerous communities and sports organisations throughout the country and I receive regular representations on both. I am always willing to engage with interested parties on the programmes given their huge benefits for so many people, communities and clubs. The recent record package of &euro;150 million in new capital grants under the SCEP (when account is taken of the &euro;6 million kept in reserve to deal with the appeals process) reflects the government&rsquo;s ongoing support to sport as the sector emerges from the challenges of the past two years. </p></reply>

These vacancies arose from the mid-term resignation of one member at the end of 2020 and with the expiry of five members' terms at the end of 2021. Under the Arts Act 2003, there is a Chair and 12 ordinary members on the Board of the Arts Council, all appointed by the Minister for a period of five years.</p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) has responsibility for putting in place an open, accessible, rigorous and transparent system to support Ministers in making appointments to State Boards</p>  <p>  The vacancies in question were advertised openly on the State Boards portal www.stateboards.ie operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) on 15 September 2021.  By the extended closing date on 13 October 2021 a total of 108 expressions of interest were received.  </p>  <p>  A PAS assessment panel was then set up to examine the applications received for appointment to the Board of the Arts Council. The Arts Council requires a skills mix that allows it to fulfil its statutory functions under Section 11 (1) of the Arts Act. The panel identified sixteen candidates who met the specific criteria required of members of the Board of the Arts Council.  </p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service has written to me and, following a period of careful consideration, I have now decided on the candidates that I am appointing to the Arts Council.  Both successful and unsuccessful candidates are today being notified of the outcome of the process.  I have treated this decision with the utmost importance as I am aware that each appointee will serve on the board for a minimum of 5 years.</p>  <p>  There is a statutory gender balance on the Arts Council.  Section 11(7) of the Arts Act specifies that of the members of the Council, not less than 6 of them shall be men and not less than 6 of them shall be women.   This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s target of at least 40% for representation of each gender on State Boards.</p>  <p>  There is an Information Booklet Archive on the stateboards.ie website where previous Information Booklets can be found including that published for the Arts Council.</p>  <p>  There is also information published on the Arts Council website including the minutes of the Council&rsquo;s plenary meetings.  </p></reply>

However, it is a sector that is undergoing fundamental change and faces significant challenges.</p><p>Acknowledging both the importance of the sector and the rapidly changing landscape in which it operates, the Programme for Government committed to the establishment of the Future of Media Commission.</p><p>Chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, the Commission was tasked with considering the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion; and to consider the potential measures required to ensure that our public service media continues to play its essential role within our society. This included considering how public service media can be funded in a way that is sustainable, gives greater security of funding, ensures independent editorial oversight and delivers value for money; and to make recommendations on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s role, financing and structure within the public service media framework.</p><p>After extensive engagement with stakeholders and the wider public, the Commission completed its work and submitted its report to the Taoiseach and myself last Autumn. The Report&rsquo;s recommendations are far-reaching and will inform media and broadcasting policy in the coming years. </p><p>As such, they have required careful and detailed consideration, particularly in light of a range of other complex and inter-related issues that will require decisions by Government in the wider media and digital space. These include the recently published national digital strategy <i>Harnessing Digital </i>&ndash; The Digital Ireland Framework and Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the implementation of the forthcoming Digital Services Act. </p><p>The report is being considered by An Taoiseach. myself and other relevant Ministers with a view to it being brought to Government for consideration shortly.</p></reply>

Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will include an Online Safety Commissioner to enforce not just this legislation, but also additional legislation and measures that will be brought forward at European level in the coming years. The goal of the Online Safety Commissioner will be to minimise the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through binding Online Safety Codes, including certain criminal content, serious cyberbullying content, content promoting self-harm and suicide and content promoting eating disorders. The Commissioner will have specific regard to the effects of such content on children when defining and enforcing the Online Safety Codes.</p>  <p>  A programme of work is now underway to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and experience to establish and lead An Coimisi&uacute;n and to lay the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions. This includes managing the transition of Broadcasting Authority of Ireland staff and functions to An Coimisi&uacute;n, while at the same time ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulation set out under the Broadcasting Act 2009. </p>  <p>  The recruitment of the Online Safety Commissioner is a priority. Work is currently underway between my officials and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service to secure the recruitment of the Online Safety Commissioner through an open, transparent and effective public competition.</p>  <p>  As provided for by the Bill, the recruitment of the Online Safety Commissioner will be carried out by the Public Appointments Service. I would expect that this critical post would be advertised in the second quarter of 2022 at the latest.</p>  <p>  In terms of the timeline of the Bill itself, the second milestone in the progress of the Bill through the Houses was completed on Tuesday, when the Bill competed Second Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. That debate provided an opportunity for me to outline what I believe are the most important provisions of the Bill, including the establishment of An Coimisi&uacute;n, and for me to listen to perspectives of Senators from all sides of the House.</p>  <p>  Based on that debate, and the widespread recognition of the importance of the Bill, I am confident that we as parliamentarians can complete our consideration of the Bill by the Summer recess.  I acknowledge that this is an ambitious timeline for a Bill of this scope and scale. However, I believe this will still allow us to give extensive consideration to the Bill in Committee and Report Stages in both Houses. I know that Members of both Houses are as committed as I am to the enactment of the Bill and to the formal establishment of An Coimisi&uacute;n and commencement of its operation.</p></reply>

Central to developing a more resilient and sustainable tourism sector will be an increased focus on the promotion and development of sustainable tourism practices such as ecotourism.  Late last year, I brought a report to Government which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to the development of a new national tourism policy.  The successful implementation of these actions will shine a light on areas and destinations that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the important role that tourism plays as a driver of rural economies and I am committed to a continued focus on the potential of tourism to facilitate the development of our rural areas.  As we rebuild our tourism sector we will seek to realise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be amongst the world leaders in sustainable tourism practices and to set out a path for a green transition of the tourism industry and for our destinations to become leading sustainable tourism destinations.</p>  <p>  Our overall tourism product offering has led to Ireland being recognised internationally as a year-round, high-quality tourism destination in both urban and rural settings.  The further development of our tourism product offering, including any specific plans relating to environmentally sustainable tourism or eco-tourism, is an operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Accordingly, I have referred this question to the agency for direct response to the Deputy.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

Following that forum I held a public consultation throughout the month of January. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the consultation was to ensure that the general public, artists, and those working in the arts and culture sector have the opportunity to contribute to policy development for the pilot scheme and to offer suggestions from their experiences as artists, arts workers, and members of resource organisations on key issues such as the schemes objectives, eligibility criteria, supporting emerging artists and participant responsibilities.</p>  <p>  The public consultation closed three weeks ago and my Department received a significant number of submissions, reflecting the high level of interest in this new policy intervention. Officials in my Department are currently reviewing the submissions and a report on the consultation is currently being prepared which will be published  shortly. </p>  <p>  I am at present giving consideration to the feedback of the sector received through the consultation as I finalise the eligibility criteria for the pilot scheme.  Such a significant policy intervention takes time to operationalise and final details of the selection process, number of participants, eligibility criteria, rate of payment etc. are being reviewed following the consultation. However, the following broad parameters have been agreed:</p>  <p>  - Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test.</p>  <p>  - It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process.</p>  <p>  - A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post appraisal of the pilot in due course.</p>  <p>  I have always stated that my ambition is to open the scheme for applications in the first quarter of 2022 and that remains the case.  My Department is currently finalising the scheme taking on board the feedback from the consultation and I expect to make an announcement in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  As this is a pilot scheme with the intention of researching what the impact of a basic income style support would have on the arts sector, it would not be appropriate to extend it to everyone in the sector at pilot stage.  The three year research programme will collect data to provide the evidence base regarding impact.  A decision based on the outcome of the research would then need to be taken by Government as to if the scheme were to become a permanent intervention and if it would be extended to all eligible artists and creative arts workers. </p>  <p>  The Basic Income for the Arts pilot is a key priority of mine.  I believe the pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives. </p></reply>

Central to the pursuit of that objective is the application of a Sport for All approach that is aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027. </p><p>At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023 and this includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport. </p><p>That plan contains a specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. It further commits that this fund will apply the Sport for All ethos.Work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in funding drawn down from the Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated from the Dormant Accounts funding for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision. </p><p>In addition to this over-arching emphasis on the Sport for All approach, the Sports Action Plan also provides for an annual Winter Initiative, which is a rolling programme of activities and initiatives that aims to get people back to sport and increase participation in the aftermath of COVID-19. The programme has run successfully over the past few months, with a wide range of activities taking place throughout the sports sector and includes measures to boost participation levels among persons with disabilities. The Winter Initiative programme has provided National Governing Bodies of Sport with a perfect platform to launch their Autumn and Winter Programmes and will continue up to the end of March.</p><p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that at the last count there were over 700 events occurring under the Winter Initiative. 66 National Governing Bodies of Sport are participating, as are all 29 Local Sports Partnerships. Details on the events that are taking place can be found on the website of Sport Ireland, and through the respective organisations running the events. It is my intention that a similar programme will be run next Winter and to that end my Department and Sport Ireland will commence planning in that regard in the coming months.</p><p>I would also like to emphasise the important contribution that Sport Ireland makes in this area. Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards. </p><p>In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its <i>Participation Plan 2021-2024</i>&ndash; Increasing Participation in Changing Ireland. The Participation Plan outlines how Sport Ireland will continue to help people get active by removing barriers to participation in sport and physical activity in the coming years. The Sport Ireland Participation Plan actions will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies, strategic partners, clubs, communities and individuals.</p><p>The Sport Ireland Participation Plan is built on, and guided by, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 (NSP) and the Sport Ireland Strategy 2018-2022. The Participation Plan takes into consideration Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013&ndash;2025 and the National Physical Activity Plan as well as global and national developments. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a specific Diversity and Inclusion policy which is expected to be launched in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

That includes women in leadership positions such as board members of National Governing Bodies (NGBs). </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the significant efforts that sporting bodies are now making around gender diversity on their boards. It is evident, however, that more work needs to be done. In the new Action Plan for Sport 2021-2023 we are asking all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023.  It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation.</p>  <p>  The most recent Board Composition Snapshot which was published by Sport Ireland in December, shows that the overall percentage of women on boards of NGBs has increased from 24% in 2019 to 32% in 2021. The Snapshot also highlights that 39 NGBs have now achieved 30% or more women on their board, up from 19 NGBs in 2019. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland will continue to provide support to NGBs towards achieving the target of 40% and will monitor and report on progress. </p></reply>

The Code of Programme Standards developed by the BAI pursuant to section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out that broadcasters should exercise due care in broadcasting depictions and/or descriptions of violence in programme material. The Code also sets out that broadcasters shall have due regard to the appropriateness of and/or justification for the inclusion of violent content in programme material. </p><p>In regard to the portrayal of violence through social media and audiovisual-on-demand media services, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 will establish Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n as a multi-person Media Commission to include an Online Safety Commissioner. It will dissolve the BAI, establish regulatory frameworks for online safety and the regulation of audiovisual media services, and transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive.</p><p>The Bill will also amend and extend the duties, codes and rules currently applicable to broadcasters under the Broadcasting Act 2009 to audiovisual-on-demand media services. Accordingly, the Bill will empower Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n to make codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by both broadcasters and audiovisual-on-demand media services. Under the Bill, An Coimisi&uacute;n may, in particular, make codes to ensure that programme material relating to gratuitous violence or sexual conduct is presented with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience and in such a way that children will not normally hear or see anything which may impair their physical, mental or moral development.</p><p>It will be the role of the Online Safety Commissioner to oversee the regulatory framework for online safety. As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how designated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. </p><p>  Among other categories of content, online safety codes will ensure that designated online services take appropriate measures to reduce the availability of offence-specific online content and cyber-bullying material on their services. The full list of offence-specific online content is set out in section 45 of the Bill and includes, for example, relevant offences under Coco&rsquo;s Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020. In the case of Coco's Law, it is intended that this will have the effect of reducing the availability, on designated online services, of intimate images which have been shared without consent and of threatening or grossly offensive communications about, or to, another person.</p><p>In addition to instances of cyber-bullying which would be considered as offence-specific harmful online content, the online safety codes will also address serious cyber-bullying material which is not related to a criminal offence. In contrast to the category relating to offence-specific online content, the non offence-specific categories of content will be subject to a risk of harm test. Accordingly, such content will only be considered harmful online content under the Bill where it gives rise to any risk to a person&rsquo;s life, or a risk of significant harm to a person&rsquo;s physical or mental health. </p><p>Under the Bill, in the event of a failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover.</p><p>  Finally, the Bill will also allow the An Coimisi&uacute;n to create non-binding guidance materials for providers of relevant online services. Such guidance materials may seek to protect children in particular, but also the general public, from harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content.

The allocation includes &euro;50 million for business continuity supports and a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.</p><p>As part of its marketing strategy, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. The organisation has a flexible, three-phase plan to RESTART, REBUILD and ultimately REDESIGN demand. Over &euro;80 million will be invested in the programme in 2022, which will allow Tourism Ireland to ramp up its campaigns in key international markets.</p><p>Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Green Button campaign will continue to drive demand throughout 2022, with its largest-ever TV campaign running in our top four markets, namely Great Britain, the United States, Germany and France. This campaign will also be expanded in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Nordic countries, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and the UAE.</p><p>St Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers a unique opportunity for the island of Ireland around the world and once again this year, hundreds of iconic landmarks and buildings around the world will take part in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Global Greening initiative. This year&rsquo;s programme will include a new campaign, The Green Button Festival. The campaign will align with Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Green Button advertising campaign and will run in 14 markets. It will include turning high impact outdoor advertising sites into stages highlighting Irish culture.</p><p>Tourism Ireland will continue to work with airlines and ferry companies through a programme of jointly funded marketing initiatives to support the restoration of air and sea access routes which are so vital for tourism&rsquo;s return to growth.</p><p>Tourism Ireland will also leverage the tourism opportunities presented by a number of key events and global opportunities. These include:</p><p>- Expo 2020 in Dubai, which runs until the end of March 2022</p><p>- The new Game of Thrones Studio Tour at Linen Mills Studio in Banbridge</p><p>- The Aer Lingus College Football Classic, which takes place in Dublin in August</p><p>- Ulysses 100 (2022 marks 100 years since the publication of James Joyce&rsquo;s celebrated <i>Ulysses</i>)</p><p>2022 will also see an increasing focus on initiatives designed to encourage sustainable tourism, while still delivering on Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s RESTART objectives.</p></reply>

A total of 52 pools have been completed under the LASPP and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme with the Lucan project currently under construction.</p><p>My Department's capital support for any new swimming pools is now being provided through the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m for the Fund over the period to 2027. </p><p>The first call for proposals under the LSSIF closed in 2019 with applications confined to local authorities and National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of Sport. All applications were assessed in accordance with the published Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines and the first allocations were announced in January 2020. Thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations include funding for 8 swimming pool projects as follows: </p><p>1. Laois: Portarlington Leisure Centre Swimming Pool</p><p>2. Sligo: Waterpoint Aqua Park</p><p>3. Kilkenny: The Watershed Development, </p><p>4. Limerick: Askeaton Pool and Leisure</p><p>5. Wicklow: Wicklow Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre</p><p>6. Louth: Dundalk Leisure Centre</p><p>7. Galway: Galway Regional Aquatic &amp;amp; Fitness Centre</p><p>8. Dublin: Samuel Beckett Civic Campus Phase 2</p><p>The priority in the short term is to advance all LSSIF projects, including these swimming pools, to  construction stage. </p><p>In relation to future swimming pool funding, my Department is currently undertaking a review of progress on all existing LSSIF grants. As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals and the review work is at an advanced stage and expected to be finalised shortly. </p><p>In addition, the National Sports Policy commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, contains an action to develop and implement a National Swimming Strategy to provide additional swimming opportunities indoors and outdoors. Initial preparatory planning work has been undertaken by my Department in this regard. It is intended to establish a working group in the near future to take forward the detailed work of preparing a national swimming strategy, with a view to its completion and publication later this year.</p><p>The outcome of these reviews and strategies will be fully considered when deciding on the future funding provision for swimming pools.</p></reply>

As our economy and society opens up, we have an opportunity to reconfigure our tourism sector and to more meaningfully address sustainable development and management within the tourism ecosystem.</p>  <p>  In this regard my Department has initiated the development of a new national tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry and our communities to help set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. </p>  <p>  I reconvened the Sustainable Tourism Working Group early last year to complete the development of a suite of actions that promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to a new policy being developed. I brought the Group&rsquo;s report to Government in October and it was subsequently published online at www.gov.ie/en/publication/c0cd3-sustainable-tourism-working-group-report/. </p>  <p>  The successful implementation of the actions identified in this interim action plan will establish new research methods, which will increase the level of evidence available, and form a clear narrative for communicating about the sustainability agenda to build a better understanding and awareness among tourism stakeholders and the general public. It will also ensure that sustainability is taken into account in policy development, business planning by the tourism agencies and industry as well as in destination management and promotional activity.</p>  <p>  The development of our new national tourism policy will build upon the work undertaken by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group and also be consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. This policy commitment will seek to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be among the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices from not only an environmental but also a social and economic perspective.</p></reply>

Our overall vision for women in sport is one where women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport. </p>  <p>  A fundamental aim of the Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to increase the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population, with a specific focus on less represented groups including women and girls.  A lot of good progress is being made, not just in terms of increasing participation by women and girls but also in the important areas of leadership and management roles in sport. </p>  <p>  The Women in Sport funding programme is an important support for sporting bodies in putting programmes in place to increase women&rsquo;s participation in their sports and to progress their strategic objectives for women in sport. Last year, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;4m in the Women in Sport Programme for the two years 2021 and 2022.  45 NGBs will receive funding under this investment.  A further &euro;265,000 was invested last year in the Local Sports Partnerships under the Programme. </p>  <p>  One of my priorities in 2021 was to eliminate the funding gap that existed in grant funding for male and female Gaelic players and I am very pleased to have achieved that aim and ensured that we have now parity in terms of that grant funding. Additional funding has been provided for enhanced support of female inter-county Gaelic games players on an equivalent basis to that being provided for their male counterparts. This additional provision brings the total amount available for female players in this context to &euro;2.4m. This is a very important development for women&rsquo;s sport and demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to equality in sport.  </p>  <p>  The aim in the National Sport Policy 2018-2027 is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport entirely by 2027. The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor Report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years.</p>  <p>  While the Irish Sports Monitor report for the first quarter of 2021 showed that the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest Irish Sports Monitor figures for Quarter 3 show that a gender gap is beginning to re-emerge as COVID 19 restrictions are lifted.  The emerging gradient is cause for focus and ongoing monitoring. To this end, many National Governing Bodies are delivering Women in Sport and Dormant Accounts Funded Programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities.</p>  <p>  Addressing women&rsquo;s participation at all levels in sport is an important element of the National Sports Policy. That includes women in leadership positions such as board members of National Governing Bodies. The National Sports Policy had originally set a target of 30% of either gender on the Boards of funded bodies by 2027.  In the new Action Plan for Sport 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, we have set a revised target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023.  It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation.</p>  <p>  While there has been good progress for women in sport, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. My officials and I continue to work closely with Sport Ireland and the sport sector with a view to achieving a much improved landscape for women and girls in sport.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-24a.118.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022400060#WRC00800"><p>Increased participation in sport is a key objective of my Department. In the pursuit of that objective, we are committed to a Sport for All approach aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.</p>  <p>  At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023, which includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.</p>  <p>  That plan contains a specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. It further commits that this fund will apply the Sport for All ethos.  Work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in funding drawn down from the Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated from the Dormant Accounts funding for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a specific Diversity and Inclusion policy which is expected to be launched shortly. </p>  <p>  In relation to participation in sport by women and girls, the aim in the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport entirely by 2027. The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor Report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years. </p>  <p>  While the Irish Sports Monitor report for the first quarter of 2021 showed that the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest Irish Sports Monitor figures for Quarter 3 show that a gender gap is beginning to re-emerge as COVID 19 restrictions are lifted.  The emerging gradient is a cause for focus and ongoing monitoring. To this end, many National Governing Bodies are delivering Women in Sport and Dormant Accounts Funded Programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities. These targeted activities form part of a Winter Initiative for sport to kickstart participation following the reduction in restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Women in Sport funding programme is an important support for sporting bodies in putting programmes in place to increase women&rsquo;s participation in their sports and to progress their strategic objectives for women in sport. Last year, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;4m in the Women in Sport Programme for the two years 2021 and 2022.  45 National Governing Bodies (NGBs) will receive funding under this investment.  A further &euro;265,000 was invested last year in the Local Sports Partnerships under the Programme.</p>  <p>  Finally, in terms of bridging the gap in administrative participation in sports, the Sports Action Plan sets a target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023. It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation. The most recent Board Composition Snapshot, which was published by Sport Ireland in December, shows that the overall percentage of women on boards of NGBs has increased from 24% in 2019 to 32% in 2021. The Snapshot also highlights that 39 NGBs have now achieved 30% or more women on their board, up from 19 NGBs in 2019. Sport Ireland will continue to provide support to NGBs towards achieving the target of 40% and will monitor and report on progress.</p></reply>

The only outstanding language plan relating to Oile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann, is currently being reviewed by my Department. To date, 20 Language Planning Officers and 4 Assistant Language Planning Officers have been engaged at community level to advance the implementation of agreed plans.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that a total allocation of &euro;5.8m has been allocated in Budget 2022 to directly support the process. This represents an additional &euro;800,000 over the 2021 allocation. </p>  <p>  Language plans in respect of four Gaeltacht Service Towns - Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, Letterkenny, Galway City and An Cloch&aacute;n Liath - have been approved to date while language plans in respect of the towns of Tralee and Dungarvan are currently being evaluated by my Department.</p>  <p>  The process of preparing language plans is underway for the following towns - Cahersiveen, Cork City, Castlebar, Clifden and Ballinrobe, while the preparation of plans has yet to begin in respect of Donegal Town, B&eacute;al an Mhuirthead, Macroom, Athboy and Navan.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, language plans in respect of three Irish Language Networks have been approved under the language planning process, namely, Ennis, Clondalkin and Loughrea. Foras na Gaeilge has also approved two Irish Language Networks north of the border which, although falling outside the scope of the Act, form an integral part of the language planning process. </p>  <p>  A broader overview of the advances being made in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions - including the language planning process, is set out in the second progress report on the ongoing implementation of the Government's 5-year Action Plan for the Irish Language which my Department published on behalf of Government in October 2021. </p></reply>

The allocation includes &euro;50 million for business continuity supports and a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.</p>  <p>  As part of its marketing strategy, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. The organisation has a flexible, three-phase plan to RESTART, REBUILD and ultimately REDESIGN demand. Over &euro;80 million will be invested in the programme in 2022, which will allow Tourism Ireland to up weight its campaigns in key international markets.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Green Button campaign will continue to drive demand throughout 2022, with its largest-ever TV campaign running in our top four markets &ndash; Great Britain, the United States, Germany and France. This campaign will also be expanded in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Nordic countries, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and the UAE.</p>  <p>  St Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers a unique opportunity to promote the island of Ireland around the world and once again this year, hundreds of iconic landmarks and buildings around the world will take part in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Global Greening initiative.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland will continue to work with airlines and ferry companies through a programme of jointly funded marketing initiatives to support the restoration of air and sea access routes which are so vital for tourism&rsquo;s return to growth.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland are doubling their domestic marketing investment in 2020 to &euro;10 million to drive domestic demand including short breaks all year round. In that regard, they have embarked on extensive marketing and communications campaigns, including their "Keep Discovering" campaign, which continue to encourage domestic holidaymakers to take vacations in Ireland, particularly during quieter shoulder seasons.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also deliver four new Regional Tourism Strategies, setting out a 10-year vision and 5-year action plan for each region, and aim to ensure tourism businesses are visible, searchable and most importantly bookable through its Digital that Delivers programme. The agency has also provided a Keep Discovering Marketing Toolkit on their website which offers free marketing tools, templates, helpful guides and curated images to assist tourism businesses in attracting more visitors. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also remains focused on helping businesses to promote Ireland as an international destination and continues to assist Irish tourism attractions and activities across the country to try to influence the travel itineraries of tour operators and Destination Management Companies for 2022 and beyond. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am continuing to work closely with the sector on recovery. The Tourism Recovery Oversight Group, which I appointed in 2020, continue to oversee the implementation of the Tourism Recovery Plan and monitor the sector&rsquo;s recovery more generally. This Group report to me on a regular basis and its work will inform future policy considerations as I continue to work alongside my Government colleagues to support the tourism sector over the coming year and beyond.</p></reply>

That cooperation has been hugely beneficial, with the tourism sector now an exemplar of what can be achieved when we work together on this island with a shared purpose and for clear mutual benefit. </p><p>Through Tourism Ireland, we have developed a hugely successful approach to promoting our collective tourism offering to markets all around the world, which sustains and creates jobs in the sector in towns, cities and regions across both jurisdictions on the island. </p><p>Tourism Ireland promotes the island of Ireland in more than 21 markets overseas as a compelling holiday destination, using the Ireland brand to position the island as strongly as possible against more than 200 other destinations with which Ireland competes.  Tourism Ireland promotes the experience brands &ndash; including the <i>Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands, Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, Dublin </i>and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s<i>Embrace a Giant Spirit</i>&ndash; on a range of platforms, including online, via publicity and their overseas trade platforms.</p><p>North-South engagement and collaboration in the area of tourism has added value to the marketing of the island to potential overseas visitors for both jurisdictions.  Significant achievements over this time include:</p><p>- the branding and marketing of the Causeway Coastal Route</p><p>- the Global Greening initiative around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day </p><p>- the development of screen tourism, including Game of Thrones </p><p>- the Taste the Island food and drink initiative </p><p>- and maximising the tourism benefits of major sporting events such as the Irish Open (golf) and the Giro d&rsquo;Italia as well as other initiatives such as &lsquo;The Gathering&rsquo; and Derry/ Londonderry UK City of Culture.</p><p>My Department and both tourism agencies will continue to foster north-south co-operation to enhance an all-island tourism offering and grow international visitor numbers to the entire island. My officials continue to liaise with their counterparts in the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland - through monthly meetings and also quarterly operational meetings with both the Department for the Economy and Tourism Ireland.</p><p>On 20 January 2022, I took part in a Shared Island Dialogue event hosted by the Department of the Taoiseach, which focused on all-island tourism. Over 160 tourism and civil society stakeholders from across the island joined the event online to discuss the success of tourism cooperation on the island of Ireland over the past 20 years and explore how best to enhance opportunities for domestic and international visitors in the years ahead.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with the Department of An Taoiseach on implementing our commitments to the North/South development of tourism as included in the Shared Island chapter of the renewed National Development Plan. This includes supporting Tourism Ireland in its mission to grow tourism into the island of Ireland, to promote the recovery of the sector post-pandemic and to work with the Northern Ireland Executive on developing large scale North/South tourism initiatives which will support the sustainable growth of the sector including cross-border walking and cycling trails as well as new marketing opportunities. </p></reply>

To this end, officials of my Department have developed a rolling work plan which sets out the various steps to be taken in the coming months. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a long-term project involving comprehensive research and the development of a National Plan for the Provision of Irish-Medium Public Services. A statutory Advisory Committee will be established for this purpose and progress will be reported to Government on an annual basis. The Act sets targets that will challenge all in Government, in particular the target of 20 per cent of new recruits to the public service being competent in Irish by the end of 2030. Among the functions of the Advisory Committee under the Act will be the provision of advice to public bodies as to the level of competence required by a person in order for them to provide services through the medium of Irish. </p>  <p>  My main priority at present is the process to be conducted under Section 18B of the Act to recruit members of the Advisory Committee to represent the Irish-speaking community from both within and outside the Gaeltacht. To this end, my Department has written to the Public Appointments Service asking them to commence this process. In tandem with this, my officials are preparing a role specification for use by the Public Appointments Service when administering the competition.  Nominations will be also sought in relation to the other members nominated by public bodies in due course. </p>  <p>  I have secured additional resources within my Department allocation in Budget 2022 to accelerate the implementation of the new legislation, as well as for the provision of additional resources to the Office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga this year to strengthen that office's monitoring systems.  Recruitment of these additional staffing resources is nearing completion. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to organise, over the months ahead, a series of information seminars for public bodies in relation to the provisions of the new Act, while commencing relevant sections of the Act at appropriate intervals.</p></reply>

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion.  The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the Programme closed for applications on 1 March 2021.  By this date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.  </p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published prior to assessment work commencing and all applications were assessed in accordance with these procedures. The scoring system prioritises applications that will increase participation and the level of existing facilities in the area is a key consideration in this regard.</p>  <p>  All of the improvements which were introduced for recent rounds of the Programme to make the process as user-friendly as possible were maintained for this round. This included giving applicants a second chance to submit corrected documentation. The full scoring system and assessment procedures can be viewed at the following link: - www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie/ </p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February. All valid applications including any received from rapid growth areas received a grant offer.  </p>  <p>  A full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and, as part of the review, my officials will examine the distribution of funds in terms of, inter alia, their geographic, sectoral and socio-economic impact. Any recommendations arising from the review will be factored into the terms and conditions of the next Round.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Sport Ireland is continuing to develop a national digital database of sport and recreational facilities, which it is hoped can be significantly completed by the end of 2023. It is envisaged that the database will permit the undertaking of enhanced, strategic demographic analyses to inform future grant allocation decisions on the nature and location of sports facilities.</p></reply>

ComReg advises that the current minimum coverage obligations in those licences are being considerably exceeded by all operators.</p>  <p>  Capital investment by telecommunications operators over the last 5 years was in the order of &euro;3.3 billion for both fixed and mobile services. This has significantly enhanced the availability of services, both voice and data, throughout Ireland, including in rural areas. Telecommunication operators have committed to continued investment programmes in the coming years, estimated to be in the region of &euro;700m per annum.  </p>  <p>  ComReg is currently in the process of running another Multi-band Spectrum Award to assign rights of use in four spectrum bands The award comprises 470 MHz of spectrum and represents a 46% increase in the harmonised spectrum assigned for the provision of wireless broadband services in Ireland. This will significantly enable the market to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data and new services.  </p>  <p>  To assist consumers to choose the network provider that best meets their needs for where they live, work and travel, ComReg has developed a national outdoor coverage map. This map which is available on the ComReg website provides consumers with very clear information on where operators have good 2G, 3G and 4G coverage. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s level of connectivity to support digital activity has improved significantly in recent years. The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) is a composite index summarising relevant indicators on Europe&rsquo;s digital performance. Ireland ranked 5th in 2021 among EU countries, compared to 11th in 2019. The continued investment by commercial operators and by the State through the NBP will ensure that Ireland is set to become the EU leader in connectivity by the second half of this decade. </p></reply>

Formal procurement of international experts in electricity grid infrastructure was completed last September. Whilst my Department had hoped to receive their report before now, the experts have informed my officials that they plan to submit it to the Department by next month.

A key target set out in the Climate Action Plan is to carry out a work programme to identify a route to deliver one to three terra-watt hours of zero emissions gas (including green hydrogen) by 2030. The plan includes a suite of actions relating to green hydrogen across the electricity, enterprise and transport sectors. These actions include:</p>  <p>  - testing the technical feasibility of safely injecting green hydrogen blends in the gas grid; </p>  <p>  - assessing the potential for system integration between the electricity and gas networks, which will include the production, storage and use of green hydrogen; and,  </p>  <p>  - progressing research and pilot studies regarding the use of hydrogen in the transport sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is developing a number of initiatives on the role of green hydrogen in decarbonisation. The 2021 SEAI National Energy Research Development &amp;amp; Demonstration Programme Call included a number of projects relating to green hydrogen, and the development of floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage. The SEAI's National Heat Study published this week examines options to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors in Ireland to 2050, including options for green hydrogen.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the Climate Action Plan will be updated on an annual basis to reflect ongoing developments and targets achieved. I expect a strategy focussing on the development of green hydrogen to be included in Climate Action Plan 2022. </p></reply>

The scheme is a collaboration between my Department and the Department of Health and is jointly administered by the Health Service Executive and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Since 2016, 1,464 homes have received free upgrades to their homes, including attic and wall insulation, window and door replacement and heating system upgrades where needed.</p><p>The scheme was established as a pilot in HSE Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) 7, specifically Dublin 8, 10, 12, 22 &amp;amp; 24, and one of the qualifying criteria for the scheme is that applicants must reside within the area designated for the pilot scheme.  The numbers of upgrades completed in these areas under the Warmth and Wellbeing scheme in each of the years 2016 to 31 December 2021 are as follows. <table>    <tr>       <th>YEAR</th>       <th>NO.

Initial reports have indicated that the upgrades are also delivering benefits to the health and wellbeing of participants, including reports of needing fewer GP and hospital visits, fewer prescriptions for antibiotics as well as increased engagement with other support services in the community. An independent analysis of the scheme benefits is being carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in collaboration with the Health Service Executive.</p><p>The details of how the scheme can inform Government&rsquo;s approaches to retrofitting, especially with regard to those who are more vulnerable and at risk of energy poverty, will be informed by the final findings of the analysis.

There is further commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a longer-term plan to harness the potential 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters. The 5GW target will be primarily met through development of offshore renewable energy in Ireland&rsquo;s eastern and southern coastal regions. This reflects the suitability of water depths in these regions for deployment of conventional fixed bottom offshore wind turbines and existing electricity grid infrastructure to connect these projects to the onshore grid. </p><p>  Subsequent cost-effective deployment of renewables in deeper waters off the west coast, to take advantage of greater wind resources, should be increasingly feasible through future advances in floating turbine technology.</p><p>  The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, was enacted in December 2021 with my Department providing input on provisions specific to offshore renewable energy. The Act provides a modern, up-to-date regulatory framework that will enable offshore renewable energy developments beyond the limits of the current foreshore regime. </p><p>  Work on a revised Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP II) has also been initiated by my Department. This will provide an evidence base for the identification of the most suitable areas for the sustainable development of fixed and floating wind, wave, and tidal technologies in the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), while also considering other maritime activities and marine biodiversity. The OREDP II, along with a planned economic analysis, will set out the pathway for the development of offshore renewable energy beyond 2030.</p></reply>

In total, almost 301,000 premises in the Intervention Area across all counties have been surveyed, with over 157,000 premises constructed or under construction across 26 counties and almost 34,500 premises are now passed with high speed fibre broadband.In line with a remedial plan to address Covid-19 related delays which was agreed with the Department in April 2021, NBI had expected to have almost 60,000 premises passed and available for immediate connection by the end of January 2022. As would be expected with a large scale infrastructure build of this nature, challenges were encountered within planning and build processes and also as a result of Covid-19 impacts. NBI actively continues to work with its network and build partners to address any issues as they arise. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. The focus for 2022 is to continue to build momentum in the build, catch up on the delays experienced and plan for acceleration. Final targets for 2022 are expected to be agreed early this year.</p><p>  NBI has implemented a number of measures to help lessen the impact that these challenges have had on the rollout including:-</p><p>- Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month;</p><p>- Bringing in additional NBI resources;</p><p>- Earlier procurement of material used in the build stages; and</p><p>- Bringing in additional subcontractors.</p><p>  The Public Spending Code obliges public sector entities to ensure that contracts are managed and delivered to the specified standard, within budget and on time. The contract with NBI contains a comprehensive set of protections and legally binding obligations. The contract makes provision for dealing with delays to delivery of the network arising from unprecedented events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and NBI can seek additional time to meet contract milestones. In those circumstances no penalties would apply. In other circumstances, the contract provides that penalty provisions relating to delays to delivery of the network are applicable with respect to any delays that occur from the end of contract year 2.</p><p>  With regard to job creation, some 290 staff are employed directly with NBI and there are over 900 employees working with build/design contractors on foot of the NBP investment, with this number rising as the construction activity ramps up. The delivery of the National Broadband Plan is seen as a key enabler of many aspects of the Programme for Government. It will allow policies around remote working and remote service delivery to be realised to their full potential throughout the country no matter how remote the location. </p></reply>

The first RESS auction for onshore wind and solar projects was held in 2020 and the first RESS 1 projects have now reached commercial operation with further projects to reach commercial operation throughout 2022. </p>  <p>  The second RESS auction process has begun with the qualification application window having closed in January and the auction is scheduled to take place in May. Design of the RESS 3 onshore auction is also currently under development and my Department is also finalising the terms and conditions on the first of three planned auctions this decade for the offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS).</p>  <p>  Ireland has considerable offshore renewable energy (ORE) potential. Ireland&rsquo;s intention is to move to a plan-led approach to the development of the ORE sector. A new Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP II) will be completed by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 provides a provides the legal underpinning to an entirely new marine planning system, which will balance harnessing our huge offshore wind potential with protecting our rich and unique marine environment. In Q1 2022, my Department opened a consultation on the proposed assessment criteria for the first batch of Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from a set of seven qualified ORE projects. Consultation is also currently open on how the second batch of projects (Phase 2) will be selected to enter the new consenting system. </p>  <p>  Last week I signed the Regulations, which will provide for the Clean Export Guarantee tariff, into Irish law allowing  for micro-and small-scale generators to receive remuneration from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity exported to the grid. In addition, my Department is working with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on a policy design for a small-scale generation support scheme. This will be progressed in 2022 and is expected to become available in 2023. </p>  <p>  As regards renewable heat and cooling, the SEAI published the National Heat Study on 22 February 2022. The Study, which was prepared at my Department&rsquo;s request, contains detailed analysis which will now facilitate the development of options, policies and measures to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors to 2050 and will be a key input into the delivery of a number of actions contained in the Climate Action Plan 2022.</p></reply>

These Regulations allow the Clean Export Guarantee tariff to become available for micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. This will allow for the commencement of export payments to micro- and small-scale generators by their suppliers.</p><p>  The Government approved the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) on 21 December 2021, targeting 380MW of new generation from renewables self-consumers to contribute to an overall target for solar PV of 2.5GW by 2030 under the Climate Action Plan. The scheme will provide capital grants for new domestic and small non-domestic installations, including for farmers. Businesses, including farmers, who install new larger installations can avail of a Clean Export Premium tariff which will provide a fixed tariff for 15 years for electricity exported to the grid. The scheme design will be published in Q1 2022 and supports will be introduced on a phased basis during the year.</p><p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators, i.e. above 50kW but smaller than those supported by the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, which will be progressed in 2022 and is expected to become available in 2023. This scheme will enable larger businesses, farms and community projects to maximise their participation in the energy transition.</p></reply>

It will also facilitate the achievement of the goal of generating up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>  <p>  The existing interconnector arrangement between Ireland and Northern Ireland creates a physical constraint on the flow of electricity between the two jurisdictions. This affects the level of support that can be provided from one to the other in times of security of supply challenges. As EirGrid's most recent Generation Capacity  Statement outlines, generation adequacy shifts year-on-year, according to changes in demand. This proposed North-South Interconnector remains vital for the medium to long-term security of supply on the island of Ireland, as does the existing interconnection with Great Britain. </p>  <p>  The development of this interconnector will provide reinforcement to the North-east area grid by providing an additional high capacity circuit in the region, thus reducing flows on the existing circuits. This additional transmission capacity will cater for growth in electricity consumption for many years and will also put the north-east area in a very good position if higher demand for electricity emerges through inward investment.</p></reply>

Since 2000, over 465,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.</p>  <p>  In 2020, SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes (including the Solar PV scheme) supported 17,600 home energy upgrades. Approximately 15,500 home energy upgrades were supported last year.  It is important to note that activity in both years was significantly impacted by restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Government recently announced a range of enhanced SEAI supports for retrofit including a new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme.

The ESRI's research report concluded that using the revenue generated by the increase in carbon tax to support a series of socially progressive, targeted interventions will leave low income households, such as those where there is a person with a disability, with more disposable income than had those interventions not been implemented.</p>  <p>  The increase in the carbon tax, and the redistribution of revenue in a fair and equitable manner, was one of the key measures set out in the Programme for Government. The findings of the ESRI report were taken into consideration by policy makers when preparing Budget 2021 and Budget 2022. In both of those budgets, this Government announced increases to the carbon tax along with a series of initiatives aimed at assisting low-income households address the increase in energy prices. The initiatives announced included targeted social welfare increases, as well as financial support for a socially progressive residential retrofit programme. Modelling carried out by the ESRI indicated that these measures would result in an increase in disposable income for households in the first five income deciles. It should be noted that the increase in carbon tax in Budget 2022 will not apply to home heating fuels until May 2022.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month Government approved a package of supports aimed at making it easier and more affordable for homeowners to carry out energy upgrade work on their homes.  Included in the package are measures targeted at low-income households, including funding for a Local Authority Retrofit Programme and the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme that will deliver a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households.  Households in receipt of both the Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, where the carer lives with the person they are caring for, are eligible for the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme.  The scheme was also extended to include persons in receipt of the Disability Allowance for over 6 months and have a child under 7 years old.  These criteria will be kept under ongoing review by the Department of Social Protection.</p></reply>

I recognise the correlation between transport-related air pollutant emissions and negative public health impacts.   In 2020, monitoring stations operated by the Environmental Protection Agency, though the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme, showed that air pollution from traffic reduced, particularly at urban roadside locations, because of decreased traffic volumes due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p>  <p>  Among the best ways to reduce emissions from private vehicles across the road network as a whole, is to remove older more polluting vehicles from our streets, and to encourage a modal shift to sustainable travel options, including walking and cycling, and electric vehicles. </p>  <p>  The interim report of the Urban Transport-Related Air Pollution Group, which was published last year, made a number of recommendations on how to reduce vehicle emissions. In addition, the Five Cities Traffic Demand Management Study, published recently by the Department of Transport, proposes a range of measures to combat overreliance on cars. The report also includes a toolkit that Local Authorities can use to help them to reduce emissions, tackle congestion, and improve air quality as well as the overall urban environment in our five major cities.</p>  <p>  Further actions to reduce transport-related air pollutant emissions are being developed as part of the Clean Air Strategy, and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications continues to work in conjunction with the Department of Transport on these matters.</p></reply>

This is part of a suite of actions included in the Climate Action Plan 2021 to ensure that Ireland is planning appropriately for new energy demand in the context of our electrification and decarbonisation ambitions, while facilitating growth in digitalisation and our technology sector.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and relevant state agencies to ensure that there is a plan-led, regionally balanced approach to large developments such as data centres in future taking into account existing grid availability and the opportunity to co-locate significant renewable energy opportunities. In this regard, my Department has been engaging with officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the development of this revised Statement.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act provides, inter alia, for a maximum amount of emissions to be permitted in different sectors of the economy during a carbon budget period, referred to as &lsquo;sectoral emissions ceilings&rsquo;. All sectors of the economy will have sectoral emissions ceilings and emissions from data centres will be accounted for within the relevant sectoral emissions ceiling.</p></reply>

Government investment in County Limerick in the NBP will be in the order of &euro;84 million.</p>  <p>  In County Limerick surveying is complete in the Deployment Area of Hospital, pre-works are underway in the Deployment Area of Adare and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Limerick, with over 12,000 premises surveyed to date, over 4,800 premises under construction and over 2,500 premises available to order or pre-order.</p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond.  This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.</p>  <p>  NBI has implemented a number of measures to help lessen the impact that these challenges have had on the rollout including:-</p>  <p>  - Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month;</p>  <p>  - Bringing in additional NBI resources;</p>  <p>  - Earlier procurement of material used in the build stages; and</p>  <p>  - Bringing in additional subcontractors</p>  <p>  It remains the ambition of the Government to rollout the National Broadband Plan as quickly as possible. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. In County Limerick 13 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed, as of 11 February 2022. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  In County Limerick 11 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

The Government Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas was approved by Government and published in May 2021. The policy statement provides that, pending the outcome of a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems, that is currently being carried out by the Department, it would not be appropriate for the development of any LNG terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with. The review is expected to be completed later this year. The findings of the review will be submitted to Government. </p><p>  While there are terminals to import LNG in Great Britain, there are currently none in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland sources its natural gas from Great Britain by pipeline. I have not had any formal discussions with my Northern Ireland counterpart in relation to Northern Ireland specific policy on LNG, nor do I have plans to devise an all-island anti-fracking strategy.</p></reply>

It is important to note that activity under the Scheme in 2020 and 2021 was significantly impacted by COVID-related restrictions on the construction sector which led to a large increase in the number of homes awaiting works. Addressing wait times is a key priority for my Department and the SEAI.  </p>  <p>  The 2022 budget for the Scheme, at &euro;109 million, will support an increase in the number of homes retrofitted from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month this year. This greatly increased level of activity will enable the homes currently on the waiting list to be cleared in approximately 18 months. </p>  <p>  In addition to the record capital allocation for the Scheme this year, I have also secured additional staffing resources for the SEAI including the Warmer Homes Scheme team.  Delivery capacity in the supply chain has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel established in late 2020. The SEAI continues to work with the scheme contractors on an ongoing basis to further increase output.</p></reply>

In line with commitments in the Retrofit Plan, the Government recently approved a package of significantly enhanced supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades. The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme will provide increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard.   One Stop Shops will offer a new end-to-end project management service. This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant processes; helping with access to finance; engaging the contractors to deliver the work and then quality-assuring that work.</p>  <p>  In addition, increased grants for attic and cavity wall insulation have also been made available, covering 80% of the cost to homeowners of these highly cost-effective upgrade measures. Free upgrades are available for households at risk of energy poverty. My Department is also developing a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme which will enable financial institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates for retrofit projects. </p>  <p>  The revised grant rates were set following a comprehensive evaluation and consultative process led by SEAI and the Department, including leveraging learning and experience in SEAI, industry consultation, customer research and analysis of cost data. SEAI will monitor cost data on an ongoing basis to track and monitor changes in the market. The Department will also be working with SEAI to improve transparency in pricing among One Stop Shops. The grant rates will be kept under review taking account of the overarching need to build a much bigger home upgrade sector, evolving science, innovation, evolving technology and other relevant factors. </p></reply>

The NCSC has three main roles: national incident response; information sharing; and building resilience. The NCSC supports Government Departments, other public bodies and operators of critical infrastructure to improve the resilience and security of their IT systems to better protect services that our people rely upon, and their data.  The NCSC, in collaboration with a cross departmental group drawn from across the public service, recently published the baseline cyber security standard to be applied by all Government Departments and Agencies. In addition, the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) based within in the NCSC, has developed and deployed technology on the infrastructure of Government Departments, to detect and warn of certain types of threat.   </p>  <p>  I am in regular contact with the Director of the NCSC who advises me that the Centre is currently operating at a heightened state of preparedness as a result of recent cyber incidents and ongoing geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe. The Centre has contingency plans in place in case of an increase in tensions, and is engaging bilaterally with key infrastructure operators across Government and the private sector. The NCSC has also issued a number of guidance and support documents recently, including a &lsquo;Cyber Vitals&rsquo; Check list on 1 February, and a detailed Advisory Note on 17 February. This Advisory detailed a cyber risk assessment and appropriate advice regarding the ongoing situation in Ukraine.   </p>  <p>  The Government has committed to the further development of the NCSC including through the provision of a new permanent facility at my Department's redeveloped headquarters in Beggars Bush, capital funding to support a five-year technology strategy, and the drafting of primary legislation to provide a clear mandate and authority for the NCSC. This is in addition to the expansion in staffing at the NCSC which will see staff numbers increase by 20 before the end of this year, and to over 70 in the next five years. The Government will provide all necessary support to the NCSC to ensure it can fulfil its important role in the years to come.</p></reply>

In addition, the sectoral plans in relation to communication and energy are under my remit. Adaptation planning for water, biodiversity, and the built  and archaeological heritage sectors fall under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Coastal erosion can significantly impact Local Authority infrastructure, including roads and leisure facilities. In addition, vital infrastructure located in Local Authority functional areas, but under the ownership of other bodies, may be particularly open to the effects of coastal erosion, including water (treatment and supply), communications and energy infrastructures.  </p>  <p>  Through the National Adaptation Steering Committee, my Department works with all sectors and the Local Authorities to co-ordinate implementation of adaptation policy nationally. My Department also supports the work of the Local Authorities in implementing Local Adaptation Strategies through the Climate Action Regional Offices. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act, 2021 strengthens the role of Local Authorities for effective climate action. It sets out legislative requirements for each Local Authority to prepare a Climate Action Plan, including both mitigation and adaptation measures.. These plans will have to be consistent with national climate plans and strategies, and Local Authorities will have to liaise with each other in the preparation of these plans. </p>  <p>  I would like to see a clear policy on mapping and monitoring of the coastline emerge from the National Coastal Change Management Strategy  Working Group.  This would incorporate best available data and techniques to consider the likely impacts of climate change in a consistent manner (including those currently developed at Geological Survey Ireland), and would greatly facilitate the work of Local Authorities,  Irish Water, and relevant communications and energy agencies and companies.</p></reply>

The payment will be applied to the domestic electricity account rather than an individual. The scheme will also include pre-pay customers.</p><p>  I understand that the majority of the 300,000 tenancies registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) would hold their own domestic electricity accounts. In those instances the payment will be directly applied to these accounts. Others would have tenancy agreements where tenants pay their actual share of each electricity bill and, in those cases, will benefit from the payment because the amount of the bill will be reduced by the amount of the payment. A small proportion would have other arrangements in place whereby electricity costs are part of the rental cost. </p><p>  With the support of the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage, my Department is working closely with the RTB on a public information campaign to ensure that all tenants are aware of the scheme. Disputes relating to tenancies including terms relating to electricity payments can be brought to the RTB for dispute resolution. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that regular information updates, including frequently asked questions, are being made available on gov.ie at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ae14-electricity-costs-emergency-benefit-scheme/.</p></reply>

As part of an enhanced governance framework to reach this target, the Act also sets out the processes and timelines for settling the carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings. Once the economy-wide carbon budget programme has been approved by the Government and both Houses of the Oireachtas, I will prepare proposed sectoral emissions ceilings for Government consideration and approval.</p>  <p>  This work will take as its starting point the sectoral emissions reduction ranges agreed in the 2021 Climate Action Plan, and will involve intense engagement with all relevant sectoral Ministers and their Departments.

In addition, provision has been made in the Department's Estimate for 2022 for a year-on-year increase in the payroll and administration for the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the sum of &euro;2.5 million, for a total of &euro;2.1 million in pay and &euro;400,000 in non-pay administration overheads. The increased pay allocation is in recognition of the Government decision last July to expand the capacity of the NCSC with an additional 20 posts to be filled before the end of this year. Recruitment in respect of these posts is well underway, with three separate competitions launched and a fourth to begin this week.</p><p>The NCSC plays a leading role in implementing the National Cyber Security Strategy 2019-2024. The Strategy includes a number of measures aimed at enhancing the security and resilience of Government networks and data, as well as critical national infrastructure. Significant progress has been made in implementing these measures since 2019. For instance, the NCSC's Sensor Programme has been deployed across all Government Departments, serving as an additional layer of boundary protection that alerts the NCSC when particular types of activity are observed transiting Government networks. In collaboration with a cross departmental group drawn from across the public service, the NCSC recently published the baseline cyber security standard to be applied by all Government Departments and Agencies. The NCSC has also completed a National Risk Assessment of critical infrastructure, to ensure that NCSC has a thorough understanding of Critical National Infrastructure and has contact channels with operators.</p><p>  Strengthening the NCSC is a key component of the Strategy, and last year we commissioned a capacity review to benchmark our NCSC against its counterparts in Europe and other States. The consultants noted the knowledge, expertise and motivation of the NCSC&rsquo;s staff, which was apparent in their exemplary response to the HSE incident last May. The Government has accepted the recommendations in the capacity review and invested in increased capacity in a number of ways, including the appointment of a Director of the NCSC and a number of other new staff, new threat intelligence contracts, and a new contract with the UCD Centre for Cyber Security and Cyber Crime Investigations.</p></reply>

Contractors operating under any scheme supported by an SEAI grant must carry out the works in line with the SEAI&rsquo;s Contractor Code of Practice and Domestic Technical Standards and Specifications as well as best practice and technical guidance documents including:</p>  <p>  - NSAI S.R. 54:2014 Code of practice for the energy efficient retrofit of dwellings</p>  <p>  -  Building Regulations Technical Guidance Documents</p>  <p>  -  The System Supplier/Product Manufacturer Guidelines</p>  <p>  -  NSAI Agr&eacute;ment certificates</p>  <p>  -  Irish, British or European Standards Guides</p>  <p>  A Declaration of Works must be signed by both the homeowner and the contractor certifying completion of works. Post-works Building Energy Ratings are also carried out by independent BER assessors. </p>  <p>  In addition, contractors are required to demonstrate their tax compliance and insurance cover and cooperate with the scheme's Quality Assurance programme. The Quality Assurance programme has been designed by SEAI to maintain high standards of contractor workmanship; build consumer confidence; monitor health and safety; and ensure proper governance of the spending of public money. Regular inspections of works are undertaken on a risk-based approach in accordance with international best practice. When sub-standard works are found, contractors are required to rectify the works to the satisfaction of the inspector, at no cost to the homeowner. </p>  <p>  As part of SEAI&rsquo;s Code of Practice all contractors are required to resolve complaints. If a customer is not satisfied with the works completed, contractors must make every reasonable effort to resolve the complaint to the customer&rsquo;s and SEAI&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>  <p>  The SEAI deals with all complaints received appropriately and this informs the risk-based approach to inspections. The case by case review of any complaints may inform desk based investigations and/or site visits where deemed appropriate. SEAI operate under a Customer Charter and a complaints and appeals procedure is in place. If after following this procedure an applicant is not satisfied with the outcome, they can ask the Office of the Ombudsman for an independent review of the complaint. Further details are available here: www.seai.ie/customer-charter/.</p></reply>

Up to the end of January 2022, loans with a value of &euro;640.8 million have been drawn or approved by 9,186 businesses.  Loans up to &euro;1 million are available for terms up to 5.5 years.  Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require any personal guarantees or collateral. Businesses which have been most impacted by the effects of COVID-19 are drawing the most loans; the wholesale and retail sector, the accommodation and food services sector, the construction sector and the primary agriculture and fisheries sector account for 58% of all loans drawn under the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Loans under the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme are financed by providers using their own resources.  Schemes operating under the Credit Guarantee Act, which includes the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, are based on contingent liability. This means that there is no cost to the State unless a business is unable to pay back the loan for more than 90 days, whereupon the finance provider can call on the guarantee for 80% of the outstanding balance.  The amount paid to finance providers in respect of calls under the guarantee was &euro;252,346 at the end of January 2022.  </p>  <p>  On 19 March 2020, the European Commission adopted a Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State aid rules to support the economy and help overcome the extremely difficult situation triggered by the Coronavirus outbreak. The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme has been developed in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework and has been extended three times since September 2020 on each occasion the European Commission extended the Temporary Framework provisions. The last extension was in December 2021 and makes the scheme available until 30 June 2022.  Any extension of the scheme beyond that point is dependent on a further  extension of the Temporary Framework by the European Commission.

The report provides a valuable market analysis on the nature and quantity of the skills needed to achieve our national retrofit targets as outlined in the Climate Action Plan and National Retrofit Plan.   Building up capacity in the retrofit sector from current levels to a point where it can deliver on our national targets will require the right funding and initiatives to stimulate and support the market to invest and attract new entrants. </p>  <p>  The National Retrofit Plan, published last November, has already provided certainty to the sector in terms of the unprecedented commitment by Government to support residential and community retrofit over the next decade. The budget of &euro;8 billion to the end of the decade and annual allocations published in the National Retrofit Plan, gives confidence to the sector to grow, take on staff, invest and innovate. The new SEAI grant schemes and expansion of the Local Authority Retrofit Programme allow year-round working as compared to the stop-start programme previously in place, which held the sector back.</p>  <p>  New and expanding businesses in the retrofit sector can face challenges as they develop and expand. Therefore, SEAI will work with these businesses to encourage them to avail of the range of supports available through the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), which include financial supports, training programmes and mentoring.</p>  <p>  Expanding the retrofit workforce will also be key. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs report indicates that we need to increase the number of full time equivalent workers from 4,000 to 17,000 by the middle of the decade. Funding and operational certainty is a key step here. Furthermore, my colleague the Minister for Further and Higher Education has provided &euro;17 million to increase the number of retrofit and NZEB places to 4,550 this year. Minister Harris is also supporting two retrofit centres of excellence with three more to be in place later this year.</p></reply>

The UNFCCC 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) delivered positively on a number of important matters, including strengthened efforts to build resilience to climate change, to curb greenhouse gas emissions and to provide the necessary finance for both. The overarching COP26 decision, the &lsquo;Glasgow Climate Pact&rsquo;, signifies that the goals of the Paris Agreement can still be met and commits all Parties to accelerate action on climate this decade. Ireland is a Party to this agreement and engages in negotiations through its membership of the EU.</p><p>Climate change, as a trans-boundary challenge, can only be addressed through committed ambition and effective multilateral cooperation at the international level. The EU has earned a leadership role on climate matters and continues to advance with comprehensive and ambitious climate policy, including committing to a more ambitious target to reduce its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (relative to 1990 levels) and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Ireland has fully supported the increased EU ambition and recognises the central role that the EU has played in helping to drive the climate action agenda forward in a way that seeks to balance cost-effectiveness, fairness and solidarity across Member States. Ireland continues to support EU policy in this area.</p><p>  Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s increased targets set out in our Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 are consistent with this EU ambition, and are consistent with an appropriate contribution by the State to global efforts to limit climate change to well below 2 Degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 Degrees Celsius as articulated in the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The Climate Act sets Ireland on a legally binding path to net-zero emissions no later than 2050, and to a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030. It also establishes a significantly strengthened legally binding framework with clear commitments set in law and ensures the necessary structures and processes are embedded on a statutory basis, so that Ireland achieves its national, EU and international climate goals in the near and long-term. </p></reply>

NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and over 54,500 premises are available to order and pre-order across 22 counties. </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  It remains the ambition of the Government to rollout the National Broadband Plan as quickly as possible. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p>  <p>  The NBP Contract allows National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to explore alternative technologies if they are deemed necessary to assist delivery of the contract requirements. In doing so NBI must ensure that any alternative technologies utilised do not negatively impact on having a reliable and robust network available for all premises within the Intervention Area and that minimum contracted speeds are achieved. These considerations are a matter for NBI in the first instance given its responsibility to deliver the State led intervention under the contract with the State.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 11 February 2022, 486 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p>  <p>  The Government launched its digital strategy &ldquo; Harnessing Digital &ndash; The Digital Ireland Framework&rdquo; earlier this month. The strategy will ensure that benefits are achieved by making connectivity available to everyone, including via the National Broadband Plan, Remote Working Hubs and Broadband Connection Points, with a target of ensuring all Irish households and businesses are covered by a Gigabit network no later than 2028 and all populated areas covered by 5G no later than 2030. An outline of the Framework is available at: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/3a922-online-launch-of-harnessing-digital-the-digital-ireland-framework/.</p></reply>

While the achievement of this target will require significant effort, I am confident in the sector's ability to achieve its climate targets without compromising food production.</p>  <p>  The high proportion of national emissions represented by agriculture means that for Ireland to meet its overall emissions reduction targets, the agriculture sector must make a positive contribution to combating climate change, supporting our transition to a climate resilient and low carbon economy. The core measures outlined in the Climate Action Plan 2021 for the agriculture sector will increase both the efficiency of the sector and its diversification, including into organic production and the production of biomethane. Further measures will also be required to meet the emissions reduction target, which will include the introduction of a model for carbon farming, exploring feed-related methane reduction solutions, and conducting a diversification review which will include an assessment on the wider production of biomethane. </p>  <p>  A climate resilient agriculture sector should be able to grow sustainably, resist climate shocks and pursue climate-change related opportunities concurrently. Having a robust and sustainable agri-food sector is important for our national economy and international trade. Farmers will benefit from climate action by harnessing new opportunities, as well as reducing the harmful impacts that climate change has on their land and livelihood. Farming communities are already experiencing these impacts today, with prolonged droughts, floods, and extreme weather events. The Government is committed to striking a balance between our environmental, climate, and biodiversity needs, and supporting our farmers and agri-food industries, which is reflected in Climate Action Plan 2021.</p></reply>

It is currently the only sector which has the potential to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. In 2015, the EU LULUCF sector reported a net carbon sink of about 309 Mt CO2-eq. This was dominated by CO2 sequestered by existing and new forests. In contrast, Ireland is currently a net emitter of greenhouse gasses (GHG) from the LULUCF sector to the order of 4.8 MtCO2-eq. in 2018.</p><p>This is largely due to the GHG emissions from grasslands and wetlands, resulting from drainage of organic soils, being greater than the sink from forest land and harvested wood products. All our LULUCF categories have the potential to be managed as net sinks for GHG.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 set out a range of LULUCF policies and measures which will establish a pathway for this sector to become a sustainable net sink in the long term, supporting our transition to a carbon-neutral economy and society no later than 2050. Actions to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s net LULUCF emissions include:</p><p>- Increasing our annual afforestation rates and promoting forest management initiatives to increase carbon sinks and stores.</p><p>- Reducing management intensity (water table management) of grasslands on drained organic soils.</p><p>- Improving the management grasslands on mineral soils for carbon sequestration.</p><p>- Increasing the inclusion of cover crops in tillage and increasing the incorporation of straw to at least 10% of the tillage (cereal) area.</p><p>- Rehabilitating 65,000 hectares of peatlands across numerous landowners and projects.</p><p>In addition, the national land-use review, committed to in the Programme for Government, is under way and will consider options for how we might improve the management our land to address all our environmental challenges while supporting a sustainable agri-food sector.</p></reply>

These consultations provided information on where financial support is required for local climate action, where capacity building is needed and the types of projects and initiatives that are being considered at local level. The Conversations helped to inform the development of the Community Climate Action Programme.  The Community Climate Action Programme was launched on 10 November, 2021. Under this programme &euro;60 million from the Climate Action Fund will be invested in community climate action projects and initiatives, as well as capacity building, over the next three years. The overall aim of this Programme is to support and empower communities to shape and build low carbon, sustainable communities in a coherent way to contribute to national climate and energy targets. Phase 1 involves the allocation of an initial &euro;30 million over an 18-month period for two strands of the Programme.</p>  <p>  Under Strand 1, &euro;24 million is being provided to all local authorities to support communities to build low carbon communities in a considered and structured way. This strand is currently being finalised with the local authorities. Further information will be available from the websites of the local authorities and my Department shortly. </p>  <p>  Under Strand 2, a total of &euro;6 million will be provided to build community capacity in relation to climate action. &euro;1 million of this has already been allocated for 14 projects under the Creative Climate Action Fund. The remaining &euro;5 million has been allocated for an open call for projects and initiatives that facilitate community climate action through education, capacity building and learning by doing, which is being run by Pobal on behalf of the Department. A total of 72 applications were received in response to this call and are currently being assessed.</p></reply>

The  carbon budgets will be supplemented by sectoral emissions ceilings, setting the maximum amount of GHG emissions that are permitted in a given sector of the economy during each five-year carbon budget.</p>  <p>  Under the Climate Action Plan 2021, Ireland has a target to increase the proportion of renewable electricity to up to 80% by 2030. This will contribute to Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets by substituting primarily wind and solar electricity generation for fossil fuel electricity generation, as well as displacing emissions in other sectors, including household heating and car transport. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is Ireland&rsquo;s flagship policy to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s target of up to 80% renewable electricity by the end of the decade.  The first Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) auction for onshore wind and solar projects was held in 2020 and the first RESS 1 projects have now reached commercial operation with further projects to reach commercial operation throughout 2022. The second RESS auction process has begun with the qualification application window having closed in January and the auction is scheduled to take place in May.</p>  <p>  As well as this, Government has recently approved a Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS) which supports deployment of an expected 260 MW of new micro (&amp;lt;50 kW) renewable generation by 2030.  My Department is also developing a small-scale generator scheme for farmers, business, and communities to generate their own electricity and feed into the grid. </p>  <p>  Ireland has considerable offshore renewable energy (ORE) potential with a target of 5 GW by 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s intention is to move to a plan-led approach to the development of the ORE sector. A new Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP II) will be completed by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  This year, my Department opened a consultation on the proposed assessment criteria for the first batch of Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from a set of seven qualified ORE projects. Consultation is also currently open on how the second batch of projects (Phase 2) will be selected to enter the new consenting system. My Department is also finalising the terms and conditions on the first of three planned auctions this decade for the offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS).</p></reply>

In 2017, the impact of plastics rose to a new level of prominence following David Attenborough&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blue Planet&rdquo; series.  Since then, there have been significant developments in plastics policy both in Ireland and at EU level, most notably the EU&rsquo;s Plastic Strategy, 2018 and Single Use Plastics Directive, 2019 as well as Ireland&rsquo;s Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, 2020. Measuring the impact of these policies is key to success. </p>  <p>  Ireland transposed the SUP (Single Use Plastic) Directive last year. It banned a range of single-use items from July 2021. Further measures will be introduced this year and in coming years which will significantly reduce the impact of SUP items in use, including:</p>  <p>  -  A Deposit Return Scheme for plastic bottles and aluminium cans which will be introduced later this year;</p>  <p>  -  Measures to reduce disposable beverage cups and food containers; starting with the introduction of a so-called &lsquo;latte levy&rsquo;; and</p>  <p>  -  A number of new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes for tobacco products, balloons, wet wipes and fishing gear.New data collection arrangements to capture the volume of SUPs placed on the market and disposed of at end of life take effect this year. The outputs from this will provide essential insights into the success or otherwise of the reduction measures in place and will be used to inform the design of future interventions.</p></reply>

These policies and laws set out a hierarchy for the management and treatment of waste generated within the country.  The preferred treatment option for residual municipal waste is management via high efficiency thermal treatment, which includes energy production in line with national and European policies.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, there are currently two dedicated recovery facilities which are classified as high efficiency thermal treatment or Energy from Waste facilities; one operated by Covanta in Dublin and the other by Indaver in County Meath.  Together these plants are licensed to treat 835,000 tonnes of non-hazardous municipal waste for energy recovery.  The two facilities currently produce electricity, which is exported to the national grid. The Energy from Waste facility located in Dublin is also designed and capable of operating as a high efficiency Combined Heat and Power Facility, which can utilise some of the heat produced at the facility as a heat source for a district heating network.  Dublin City Council is currently in the process of developing a district heating network to utilise this heat for space and hot water within the city displacing alternative higher carbon generators.  In addition, three cement kilns are currently licensed to accept solid recovered fuel (SRF) derived from waste for co-incineration at their plants.  In 2021, these cement kilns processed in excess of 237,000 tonnes of SRF, which replaced fossil fuels such as gas.</p></reply>

Under this programme the national monitoring network has undergone a significant upgrade in recent years and has been expanded from 29 stations in 2017 to 97 today. The final expansion of the network will be completed this year and will increase the number of official stations to 110. </p>  <p>  All stations collect air quality data for a range of pollutants in order to provide information to the public, and for assessment against European legal limit values and World Health Organisation guideline values. Details of the locations of all monitoring stations, along with real-time and historic data from each station, can be found at www.airquality.ie. </p>  <p>  As many monitoring stations have only been in place for a short while, an analysis of longer terms trends, improvements and fluctuations across the network is not yet available. However, the EPA produce an annual report on Air Quality in Ireland which provides an overview of our air quality and key issues that impact upon it. </p>  <p>  The LIFE EMERALD project, which commenced in 2021, will use the information from our monitoring network to provide a national 3-day air quality forecast and near real-time mapping of air pollutants throughout the country; and to create historical maps of air pollutants. The project will improve Ireland&rsquo;s ambient air quality management capabilities, by using an air quality modelling system to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to poor air quality and develop a system that will provide better information to the public. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. </p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base of 3,799 at the end of 2017, to over 50,500 now. </p>  <p>  Ireland has introduced its objective to be a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050 in a robust fashion through primary legislation. The commitment has been placed on a statutory footing through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. Core Measures will focus on a shift to transport modes with lower energy consumption, including walking, cycling, and public transport; accelerating the electrification of road transport; and the use of biofuels. Examples of key initiatives include a requirement, from 2023, that all new vehicles being purchased by the State are BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles), unless there is no viable electric option. </p>  <p>  Modelling for the Climate Action Plan included electrification of the Irish fleet. A number of scenarios were modelled based on all future vehicle sales becoming 100% electric by a given year. The core scenario assumes plug-in electric vehicles rising to 100% of new private car sales (80% battery electric vehicles and 20% plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) by 2029. This uptake profile delivers around 845,000 plug-in electric private cars &lsquo;on the road&rsquo; in 2030. The private car fleet emission model suggests that this rate of uptake of electric vehicles will deliver a 36% reduction in tail-pipe carbon emissions per car Km. The overall impact of improved vehicle technology, including electrification, is a 4.0Mt (=29%) reduction in total transport-related carbon emissions by 2030.</p></reply>

In November 2019, ESB eCars introduced fees for fast charger use. The prices are set at 29c per KWh, for subscribers (&euro;5 yearly subscription), and 33c per KWh for pay-as-you-go customers.  In addition there is a fee for overstaying at a fast charger. The overstay fee is &euro;5 if a car is charging over 45 minutes.  </p>  <p>  The fees for use of fast chargers are in keeping with the recommendations of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce which set out that home charging should be the most cost-effective method of charging, followed by on-street public charging and then fast charging &ndash; with fast charging no more expensive than the cost of fuelling a conventionally powered vehicle for the same journey. </p>  <p>  In 2020, ESB eCars introduced user charges for ESB eCars standard charge points. The pricing is set at 23c per KWh for ESB subscribers and 26.8c per KWh for pay-as-you-go customers. The introduction of fees aimed to encourage further investment in charging infrastructure, ensure consumers are incentivised to charge at home and avoid overstaying at chargers. Electric vehicle owners, including the Irish Electric Vehicle Owners Association, have been broadly supportive of the ESB's introduction of fees. </p>  <p>  The application of a minimum credit limit is an operational matter and as such I have referred the Deputy's question directly to ESB ecars for reply.

This is underpinned by the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013.  The primary purpose of the Act was to replace retrospective declarations of vehicles being off the road with a system where the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.</p>  <p>  The current procedures, only allowing for a future declaration of non-use, have been in place since 2013. An owner can indicate that a vehicle is going to be off the road by making a declaration of non-use at any time in the last month of an existing motor tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use.  </p>  <p>  Where a declaration is not made in advance, motor tax must be paid for a minimum of 3 months, along with any arrears of motor tax incurred between the expiry of the last motor tax taken out and the renewal of motor tax.</p>  <p>  Motor tax legislation does not provide for exemptions in individual cases. You will appreciate the difficulties in providing for exemptions in particular cases, given that other people have had to pay arrears in motor tax where the Declaration of Non-use of a Motor Vehicle was not made on time, and the necessity generally of maintaining a consistent approach in the application of the legislation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-24a.557.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022400069#WRM01100"><p>I am fully aware of the recruitment crisis currently facing the transport sector, and of the shortage of HGV drivers in particular. The driver shortage is not confined to Ireland; it has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for a number of years now.  It is a multifaceted issue with a range of different contributing factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on the labour market for many sectors.</p><p>My Department established the National Logistics and Supply Chain<b></b>Skills Group in 2019, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sectors in Ireland.  The Group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education and training providers and all of the relevant Government Departments and Agencies. </p><p>Last year I asked the Group to examine the HGV driver shortage and make recommendations, with specific regard to actions that can be taken by Government and the industry. These recommendations were finalised at the end of 2021 and have been published here - gov.ie - Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group (www.gov.ie) The recommendations are aimed at ameliorating the supply issue, without undermining the working conditions and health and safety of drivers or other road users.  </p><p>Implementation of the Recommendations will now be monitored via the Logistics and Supply Chain<b></b>Skills Group who meet quarterly. Some of the recommendations have already been implemented and work is ongoing in respect of others.</p><p>For example, recruitment from abroad could make new drivers available in the short term. My Department maintains regular engagement with the Department of Social Protection (DSP), which has dedicated employer relations teams offering a range of supports and services to employers to fill vacancies including recruitment campaigns, specialised jobs fairs and through the online portal JobsIreland.ie.</p><p>The DSP organises events in the EU/EEA labour market via the EURES network. On 02 March next there will be a EURES event aimed at jobseekers based in Romania who are interested in coming to Ireland to work. On 15 March, there will be an event for jobseekers from across the EU with a focus specifically on jobs in Ireland in the transport sector, as well as in hospitality and construction. Companies can post job vacancies directly on the event website here - Jobs in Ireland 2022 &ndash; Hospitality, Construction &amp;amp; Transport | EURES - European Job Days &ndash; and I understand that many companies in the transport sector have already done so.</p><p>HGV drivers from outside the EU/EEA must have a valid employment permit and a visa to work in Ireland, if coming from a visa required state as defined by the Department of Justice.  Following engagement with my colleague Minister of State English at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU/EEA was removed in 2021. I am aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently experiencing a high level of applications for work permits across all sectors but has recently assigned additional resources to work through this. Non EU/EEA drivers must also exchange their HGV drivers licence for an Irish licence.  Ireland has licence exchange agreements with several countries and the Road Safety Authority, which oversees these agreements, is engaging with a number of other countries with a view to progressing further licence exchange agreements.</p><p>In terms of attracting young people already based in Ireland into transport careers, the promotion of education, training, careers and sustainable employment in the sector is crucial, along with skills development and career progression for existing workers. I am very encouraged at recent new programmes such as the BSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management and the Logistics Associate Apprenticeship involving TU Dublin and Munster Technological University and, in development, the first ever Commercial Driver Apprenticeship programme at Sligo IT.</p><p>The Logistics and Supply Chains Skills Group has recently published a comprehensive <i>Overview of the  Existing Education and Training Provision in Logistics and Supply Chain</i>. In addition, the group has prepared 2 general information notes on <i>How to qualify as a HGV driver in Ireland</i>and <i>Requirements for recruitment of HGV Drivers who are non-EEA citizens</i>, to assist individuals in understanding what is involved in becoming a HGV driver and companies in recruiting new talent. These notes are all available on the LSCSG webpage at the link provided above.</p><p>Regarding HGV driver testing in Ireland, in the 4 weeks prior to 20 February, an average of 211 tests for HGV drivers were carried out by RSA testers each week, with a pass rate of 78%. This means that 164 HGV drivers were qualified on average each week.</p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a 10-year strategy for the haulage sector. The Government&rsquo;s aim is to develop a strategy that will focus on generating efficiencies and improving standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.  A section of the Strategy will focus on the driver and skills shortage &ndash; highlighting work underway and ensuring a focus remains on this issue. Work on the strategy is ongoing with a plan for further consultation with the public and stakeholders in the coming months.</p><p>I will continue to proactively engage with the freight transport, distribution and logistics sectors and the Government is committed to continuing to support the industry. It is vitally important for education, industry, and government to work together to enhance the appeal of a career in road haulage and logistics, so that the sector can both attract and retain talent.</p></reply>

This means that driving licences that expired between 1 September 2020 and 31 October 2021 have been extended for an additional 10 months. This includes an additional authorisation that Ireland received from the EU to extend licences that expired between 1 July 2021 and 31 October 2021.</p>  <p>  When the extensions were applied, the expiry date on the driver file for each person affected was updated to the new expiry date. By law, a driving licence cannot be renewed more than 3 months before the expiry of the licence.</p>  <p>  A licence holder can request a letter of entitlement from the Road Safety Authority to bring with them when driving abroad. A letter of entitlement, also known as a driver statement, is a copy of a person's driver record and will show the extended date of expiry of their licence. Further information can be found on the National Driver Licence Service website here www.ndls.ie/about/order-my-driver-statement.html.</p>  <p>  All EU member states will recognise an extension granted by the EU. However, recognition of these extensions is a matter for each non-EU country.</p></reply>

The compromise text agreed at ECOFIN in December has been amended significantly in comparison to the original proposal so the EU Parliament will once again be consulted for their opinion. While not providing for as much flexibility as the original proposal it still provides greater scope for Member States to make changes when it comes to setting VAT rates.</p>  <p>  Once the Parliament has issued its opinion on the proposal, the Council will formally adopt the directive. I understand that when the Slovenian Presidency wrote to the European Parliament an early response was requested but it is ultimately a matter for the European Parliament when such a response issues. I understand from my officials that they expect the response in the coming months. Following the Council formally adopting the directive it will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and will enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication.</p>  <p>  In the interim officials in my Department will be reviewing the options now available to Ireland in setting VAT rates. Future tax changes are generally taken in the context of the Budget. Deputies will be aware that my officials prepare a series of papers containing tax options for the Tax Strategy Group to be considered in the context of the budgetary process, alongside a wide range of submissions from various stakeholders and lobby groups.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-24a.578.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022400069#WRM03200"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, and a Governor of the European Investment Bank (EIB), I have no role in the negotiation of contracts between the EIB and any borrowers here in Ireland.  In addition, in my role as a Governor of the EIB, I have no role in the allocation of funding in Ireland, nor do I have the authority to specify which sector funding should be allocated to.  However, I am keen that projects in Ireland are able to access funding, where it is possible, from the EIB, in particular in relation to priority issues including climate and environmental sustainability; innovation and skills; infrastructure; small and medium-sized enterprises; cohesion, and development.  In that regard, the EIB has an office in Ireland which assists interested parties in engaging with the EIB, whether it be for advisory or financial support. In addition, my Department facilitates, through an EIB-Ireland Financing Group and relevant sub-groups, engagement between the EIB and interested parties, including other Departments and State Bodies, in relation to these priorities.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the EIB has provided in the region of EUR 1billion in financial support to Irish projects in recent years.   Much of the information which the Deputy is seeking is published on the EIB&rsquo;s website (www.eib.org/en/projects/index.htm).   I understand that elements of the request, including the repayment schedule, and interest rate are commercially sensitive and not available.  In 2021 alone, the Deputy will note that Irish projects listed there received EIB funding in excess of EUR 600 million directly from the EIB.  This included EUR 65 million loan for a windfarm in County Mayo; EUR 170 million to support deployment of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) fixed very high capacity (VHC) network throughout Ireland, and; EUR 200 million to the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) for a social and affordable housing programme for the next four years.  It should also be noted that in 2021 Ireland also benefited from a number of other investments, supported by the European Guarantee Fund (EGF), a crisis support instrument, established by the EIB Group in response to the Covid-19 crisis to support SMEs and Midcaps.</p>  <p>  While I am not in a position to disclose ongoing negotiations between the EIB and other Government departments or State bodies, I would note that the EIB has been providing significant support to housing development in Ireland including the EUR 200 million loan I mentioned previously, which was signed at the end of last year.  This is in addition to other loans provided for social and affordable housing in 2019, one of which was EUR 200 million to the HFA, and another of which was to the NTMA of EUR 61 million for a PPP Social Housing Programme.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the State also supports housing development funding through a number of different State agencies, including: Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI); Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF); Land Development Agency (LDA); Housing Finance Agency (HFA); National Asset Management Agency (NTMA).  Each of these State bodies has a mandate to support the funding and development of residential housing.  The Housing Finance Agency&rsquo;s borrowing from EIB for the purpose of supporting social and affordable housing in Ireland referenced above forms part of Government&rsquo;s housing policy which is overseen by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></reply>

Subsidy payments totalling &euro;6.5 billion and PRSI credits totalling  &euro;1 billion have been processed to date.</p>  <p>  The scheme is currently open to employers who file their payroll submissions electronically through Revenue Online Service (ROS) and who were registered at, and had correctly received a valid subsidy by 31 December 2021, or who re-entered the scheme from 1 January 2022.</p>  <p>  The administration of the EWSS is placed under the care and management of Revenue.  From the commencement of the scheme up to 31 December 2021, employers had the facility to register themselves for the scheme online using ROS.  There was no &ldquo;applicant&rdquo; stage in the process for employers registering online up to this date.  As the scheme was operated on a &ldquo;self-assessment&rdquo; basis, with employers signing a declaration stating that their business qualified for the scheme, proof of eligibility for the scheme was not requested at registration stage.  In signing the declaration, employers agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of the scheme and undertook to retain all records relating to the scheme, including the basis of eligibility, for review by Revenue at a later stage. For July to December 2021, employers provided to Revenue details of their eligibility reviews on a monthly ERF (Eligibility Review Form) filed through ROS. Subsidy payments were held and not paid to those employers who breached the 30% threshold test or did not file an ERF within prescribed timelines for pay dates after 1 July. As at 21 February 2022, &euro;63.8m is being held by Revenue for threshold breaches or non-filing of the ERF record. </p>  <p>  On 21 December 2021, in light of public health restrictions announced on 17 December 2021, I announced a re-opening of the scheme for certain employers who would otherwise be ineligible. These were employers who were previously eligible for EWSS but were not eligible on 31 December 2021.  Under these measures, employers who met specific eligibility criteria were afforded an opportunity to apply for re-entry to the EWSS with effect from 1 January 2022.  Revenue received 466 applications for re-entry to the EWSS with effect from 1 January 2022 and 9 re-entry applications have been refused to date.</p>  <p>  Revenue undertakes a multi-faceted risk-based approach to compliance checks to safeguard the integrity of the EWSS. This includes real time checking of submissions and cross-referencing claim data against other Revenue data sources to identify anomalies or trends requiring attention. Overall, Revenue has finalised EWSS related interventions with 4,081 employers, recouping &euro;24.3 million, which equates to 0.37% of the total subsidy paid. There are further compliance checks with 2,215 employers ongoing, which will be finalised by Revenue in due course. </p></reply>

It involves:</p><p>-  working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government to address strategic challenges faced on the island of Ireland,</p><p>-  further developing the all-island economy, deepening North/South cooperation, and investing in the North West and border regions</p><p>-  fostering constructive and inclusive dialogue and a comprehensive programme of research to support the building of consensus around a shared future on the island.</p><p>Through this process the government will deliver existing commitments and develop a new generation of cross-border projects to achieve a more connected, sustainable and prosperous island, through all-island partnership in the years ahead.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the funding priorities of the Reconciliation Fund Strategy 2021-2024 at the Department of Foreign Affairs will seek to support projects aimed at repairing issues which lead to division, conflict, and barriers to a deeply reconciled and peaceful society and/or building a strong civil society that encompasses all communities. I note that the Fund encompasses applications that use any of a wide number of approaches to bring people from different backgrounds together including amongst other things arts, culture, and sports.</p><p>I am particularly keen that the arts, culture and creativity represent a key pillar in the Shared Island initiative.  I believe they can play a unique role in  connecting people and communities, broadening civic connections across the different communities of this island so that we have more opportunities to understand each other, and supporting a vibrant and diverse cultural and creative sector across the island.  To that end, I look forward to further exploring artistic and cultural exchange across the island in the years ahead through a wide range of cross-border initiatives in arts, culture, music, film, and through my Department's Creative Ireland Programme.</p></reply>

In the meantime, the organisation is implementing a range of actions around climate change:</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is leading the development of a community-owned solar photo-voltaic renewable energy project in the Donegal Gaeltacht of Gaoth Dobhair, where the public consultation phase began last week.</p>  <p>  An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s commissioned a feasibility study in 2020 to assess the suitability of an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s-owned site adjacent to P&aacute;irc Ghn&oacute; Dobhair (Gaoth Dobhair Business Park) for installation of a solar PV energy project as a means of reducing the Park's dependence on fossil fuel derived energy. The study indicated that the site would be suitable for a ground-mounted solar PV project and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s is currently working with Community Development organisations in Gaoth Dobhair around the development of a 5 MW project. </p>  <p>  In An Cheathr&uacute; Rua, in the Galway Gaeltacht, a community-driven photovoltaic project recently acquired grid connection notice from the ESB, with the 140 KW project, being driven by Comharchumann Mhic Dara, contributing to the greening of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s&rsquo;s business park in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua and creating the first action around the Gaeltacht village&rsquo;s stated aim of becoming a carbon-neutral peninsula. As part of the project, electric charging points for cars were also installed in the business park. The Comharchumann plan to undertake phase two of the PV solar project on the roofs of buildings in the business park in 2022 and are also looking at other possibilities in relation the development of green energy projects in the area.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of a &euro;25m investment in a deepwater harbour in Ros an Mh&iacute;l has come following the launch of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s report, showing the possibility of creating 900 Gaeltacht jobs in the offshore wind energy sector through the development of Ros an Mh&iacute;l as a wind energy hub. </p>  <p>  Currently, An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s is in the midst of an assessment of its commercial property portfolio, around energy efficiency and the potential for roof-top energy generation.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is also working with Gaeltacht communities around biodiversity and tree-planting projects, with a recent pilot rewilding programme completed in boglands in Iorras Aithneach, with a view to developing the boglands to act as carbon sinks. As part of the Bealach S&eacute;anadh Mhacha Project, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta have secured funding to prepare and implement a bio-diversity plan for the S&eacute;anadh Mhacha area. The plan will be designed to protect all biological systems and to minimise the impact of drivers on all species and habitats in the project area.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, in conjunction with Galway County Council and Comhairle Ceantar na nOile&aacute;in, is proposing to develop a Low Carbon Sustainable Centre of Excellence in the Connemara Region.   The centre will house the following projects: </p>  <p>  - A Civic Amenity/Recycling Centre</p>  <p>  - A low carbon Retrofit Training and NZEB Training Centre</p>  <p>  - Development of an Incubation and Innovation centre for the promotion of low carbon policies and renewables. </p>  <p>  In line with the Climate Action Plan 2019, it is proposed that the centre in Casla will endeavour to transform the community&rsquo;s approach to waste, this is in line with modern, circular economy principles.   This will involve a change of mind-set trough education and promotion of recycling thus ensuring the protection of our natural and man-made resources and the environment. </p>  <p>  The planned development of P&aacute;irc na Mara - a low carbon, green energy efficient innovation &amp;amp; marine park - will be a flagship project and will play a significant role in the local master plan by including ongoing research and development in delivering a low carbon and energy efficient project on site.</p>  <p>  An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s is working closely with the L&aacute;rionad Acmhainn&iacute; N&aacute;d&uacute;rtha project in Donegal, which has recently acquired RRDF funding around the development of a biodiversity hub for the north-west on an &Uacute;dar&aacute;s&rsquo;s site in Cill Ulta.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta provided an online training course for development organisations in the Gaeltacht areas in 2020 and 2021. The training included awareness programmes and thematic workshops in relation to specific development sectors. One of the sectors covered was green energy and community renewable energy initiatives. This has resulted in a number of community organisations' participation in renewable energy projects. Information on training, education and funding opportunities in this sector is provided to community organisations on a regular basis by the Community Development Unit in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is continuing to work in collaboration with Comharchumann Fuinneamh Oile&aacute;n &Aacute;rann on a number of projects .

Under this programme the Creative Youth Plan was published in December 2017 and aims to increase the opportunities for engagement by children and young people in artistic and cultural creativity, helping them to discover and develop new skills and talents that enhance their development and growth, and add to the richness of their overall learning experience. The Plan has initiatives both targeted at schools and out-of-school settings, as well as providing teachers with CPD.</p><p>Among key initiatives for schools under Creative Youth are Creative Schools which is led by the Arts Council in partnership with my Department as well as the Departments of Education, and Children and Youth Affairs.Creative Schools provides tangible supports for schools to place arts and creativity at the centre of school life. Schools participate in the initiative over a two year period and are provided with access to a &ldquo;Creative Associate&rdquo; and funding. Further information on Creative Schools can be accessed via the following link www.artscouncil.ie/creative-schools/ </p><p>Under the <i>Creative Communities</i>strand of the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provides an annual funding allocation to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022. These strategies were developed following extensive local public consultation, and are unique to each local authority reflecting the strategic priorities identified by the local community to deploy creativity for wellbeing, social cohesion and economic development. Many of these strategies include priorities that seek to enhance access, participation and engagement with culture and creativity. This funding provided to local authorities can result in the organisation of music-based creative projects such as <i>Making Music with Sonamus, </i>a tuition programme by Wicklow County Council in partnership with Music Network offering participants over 55 an opportunity to experience and learn an array of musical styles and techniques from the combined musical backgrounds of Sonamus members</p><p>The Department also provides funding to support Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;), which is the largest group involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music both at community and national level. Annual funding is provided to CC&Eacute; for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture. They promote traditional music and dance in the following ways:</p><p>Thousands of children and young people develop their musical performance (instrumentation and vocal) skills and appreciation skills at these mentored weekly classes, where the emphasis is oral transmission in an appropriate context. Over 1,500 Classes are delivered weekly in community settings. </p><p>With over 400 branches, 18 centres, 7 Regional centres and 11 Outreach centres throughout Ireland, Britain, North America and worldwide, a wide variety of formal and informal performance opportunities are provided through the Comhaltas structures and Centres. Each Centre has a local performance group which provides appropriate opportunities for young traditional artists (aged 16 upwards) to participate in formal stage performances.</p><p>Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann which is run by CC&Eacute;.  Before the pandemic it had record attendance of 500,000 annually with over 6,000 participating in its competitions. The Deputy may be interested to note that I recently approved support of &euro;100,000 towards the organisational costs of Fleadh Cheoil 2022 in Mullingar. The Fleadh Cheoil is one of the world&rsquo;s largest annual celebration of Irish music, language, song and dance. It attracts in the region of 500,000 visitors to the host town during the period of the festival, with an estimate of more than 20% coming from abroad.  This event providedmany opportunities for children and young people and their families to celebrate traditional music and dance. </p><p>My Department provides funding for the purchase of musical instruments and equipment by way of the Music Capital Scheme.  Funding is provided to a wide range of performing groups and talented musicians. Recipients have in the past included brass bands, pipe bands and marching bands as well as community organisations. The Scheme is managed by Music Network on behalf of my Department. </p><p>Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta Teo., a joint venture between &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the Arts Council, is the organisation responsible for promoting the development of the contemporary and the traditional arts, including music, in the Gaeltacht.  For the current year, the organisation is in receipt of &euro;1.2m from the partnership between  the Arts Council and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  In order to further promote and develop the language based arts in the Gaeltacht and to specifically support the language planning process and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, my Department has provided additional funding almost &euro;1.5m to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta enabling the organisation to further support and create opportunities for the artistic community, especially the among the youth of the Gaeltacht. </p></reply>

Following that forum I held a public consultation throughout the month of January.  The purpose of the consultation was to ensure that the general public, artists, and those working in the arts and culture sector have the opportunity to contribute to policy development for the pilot scheme and to offer suggestions from their experiences as artists, arts workers, and members of resource organisations on key issues such as the scheme's objectives, eligibility criteria, supporting emerging artists and participant responsibilities.</p>  <p>  The public consultation closed three weeks ago and my Department received a significant number of submissions, reflecting the high level of interest in this new policy intervention. A report on the consultation is currently being prepared which will be published in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Given the significant level of interest the Deputy will appreciate that I need to take sufficient time to adequately consider the feedback of the sector through the consultation as I finalise the eligibility criteria for the pilot scheme. Such a significant policy intervention takes time to operationalise and as that process in ongoing I have not yet finalised a launch date but I expect to make an announcement in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

This legislation provides for a radical overhaul of the way we plan for the provision of high quality Irish language public services for the Irish speaking community. This is a long-term project involving comprehensive research and the development of a National Plan for the Provision of Irish-Medium Public Services. A statutory Advisory Committee will be established for this purpose and progress will be reported to Government on an annual basis. The Act sets targets that will challenge us all in Government, in particular the target of 20 per cent of new recruits to the state system being competent in Irish by the end of 2030. </p>  <p>  In this regard, Section Alt 18C. (1)(b)(iii) of the amended Act sets out that the Advisory Committee shall provide advice to public bodies as to the level of competence required for Irish-speaking positions in the public service, having regard to the system of standards known as the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. </p>  <p>  This new regime provides that the Minister will publish, following consultation with Government Departments and agencies, a list of standards to be adhered to by those Departments and agencies when delivering services through the medium of Irish, including the level of competence in the Irish language required by relevant staff of the public body. </p>  <p>  This Act provides a clear and significant message to the Irish speaking community that the language is not only valued by the State as a living modern European language and as an intrinsic element of our cultural heritage, but that it also has a significant economic benefit for its speakers. </p></reply>

This estimate is based on the strong performance of the domestic market during the pandemic and the pent-up demand that remains in the market. Furthermore, the overseas market could return to approximately 70% of 2019 levels based on the air access outlook for 2022. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in Budget 2022, I secured a record level of funding for tourism. This funding will help to address short-term survival-related concerns and also enable recovery across industry as we reopen to international tourism and begin to transition to a more sustainable future. The funding allocated to the tourism agencies in 2022 includes &euro;50 million for further business continuity support for strategic tourism businesses and a &euro;35 million increase in the Tourism Marketing Fund as well as &euro;36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development.</p>  <p>  As part of its marketing strategy, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. The organisation has a flexible, three-phase plan to RESTART, REBUILD and ultimately REDESIGN demand. Over &euro;80 million will be invested in the programme in 2022 which will allow Tourism Ireland to ramp up its campaigns in key international markets. </p>  <p>  This year, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doubling its domestic marketing investment to &euro;10 million to drive domestic demand including short breaks all year round. F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also deliver four new Regional Tourism Strategies, setting out a 10-year vision and 5-year action plan for each region, and aim to ensure tourism businesses are visible, searchable and most importantly bookable through its "Digital that Delivers" programme.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am continuing to work closely with the sector on recovery. The Tourism Recovery Oversight Group, which I appointed in 2020, continues to oversee the implementation of the Tourism Recovery Plan and monitor the sector&rsquo;s recovery more generally. This Group reports to me on a regular basis and its work will inform future policy considerations as I continue to work alongside my Government colleagues to support the tourism sector over the coming year and beyond. </p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the global pandemic has left our tourism sector in a weakened state but we have an opportunity now to address sustainable tourism development in a more meaningful way during the recovery and rebuilding phase following this crisis. In line with our Programme for Government commitments, officials within the Department have initiated the development of a new national tourism policy which will seek to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery and subsequent re-growth in the sector.</p>  <p>  Regarding the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, as the Deputy will be aware the Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. On 11 February 2022, the Government announced a support package totalling &euro;505 million to mitigate the rise in the cost of living that is currently being experienced.  It is hoped that measures such as these will help to alleviate and mitigate the current inflationary effect on the overall economy.</p></reply>

The allocation includes &euro;50 million for business continuity supports and a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Tourism Business Continuity Programme, this funding will be allocated to assist strategic tourism businesses to recover in 2022.

F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s consumer research indicates very positive feedback for its Keep Discovering marketing campaign, which is being channelled through TV, Digital, Radio and Press to encourage people to take additional short breaks in all parts of the country.  The marketing campaign is designed to both inspire visitors to travel and then offer world-class tourism regions and destinations in Ireland to visit and experience.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also using its sponsorship of RT&Eacute; Weather as a platform to promote its Keep Discovering campaign. This platform serves as a means to remind viewers of opportunities to take short breaks, such as bank holidays, festivals and events.</p>  <p>  I am continuing to work closely with industry representatives, the Tourism Recovery Oversight Group and with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, in supporting the sector through these difficult times and to ensure its sustainable recovery.</p></reply>

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion.   The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritise the investment in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the Programme closed for applications on 1 March 2021.  By this date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200 million in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. The priority in the medium term is to progress all of these projects to grant drawdown stage.</p>  <p>  In relation to any unsuccessful applications, my Department will be in touch with relevant applicants shortly outlining the procedures which need to be followed to appeal the Department's decision. When the appeals process is complete, a full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and any recommendations contained therein will be included in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete.</p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for sports facilities under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The LSSIF is designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals.</p>  <p>  The Department also provides capital support for the construction of swimming pools.  In this regard, the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP) provides grant aid towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. To date 52 pools have been completed and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme. Lucan pool is under construction and is expected to be completed later this year, while both the Buncrana and Edenderry projects are at Contract Documents stage.</p>  <p>  Exchequer support for any new swimming pool projects is now being provided under the LSSIF.</p>  <p>  In addition to the ongoing support through capital grants for sporting infrastructure, on 13 December 2021, Minister Martin and I announced the allocation of almost &euro;80m for the sport sector under two separate support programmes.</p>  <p>  &euro;73.6 million was provided in Covid-19 funding under five separate streams to help sports organisations to recover and grow post-pandemic, support our grassroots networks of clubs and local sports partnerships, and ensure that people of all ages and abilities return to sport and physical activity.  A further &euro;5.3 million was allocated to National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Sports Partnerships for the provision of sports equipment including the roll out of defibrillators for clubs, sport kits for school children and state of the art equipment for our high performance athletes.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, the Government announced over &euro;181 million in funding for sport this year, an increase of almost &euro;11 million compared to the 2021 Revised Estimate. The current expenditure budget for Sport Ireland this year is &euro;96 million, an increase of over &euro;4 million from 2021. This funding will enable Sport Ireland to continue to support the sport sector as it recovers from the challenges of Covid and will allow continued grant funding support for sporting bodies through Sport Ireland's range of funding programmes. </p></reply>

The programme has run successfully over the past few months, with a wide range of activities taking place throughout the sports sector. It has provided National Governing Bodies of Sport with a perfect platform to launch their Autumn and Winter Programmes and will continue up to the end of March.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that at the last count there were over 700 events occurring under the Winter Initiative. 66 National Governing Bodies of Sport are participating, as are all 29 Local Sports Partnerships. Details on the events that are taking place can be found on the website of Sport Ireland, and through the respective organisations running the events. It is my intention that a similar programme will be run next Winter and to that end my Department and Sport Ireland will commence planning in that regard in the coming months.</p>  <p>  I have referred the Deputy&rsquo;s question to Sport Ireland for direct reply in relation to the level of ongoing expenditure being incurred on encouraging sporting activity at local level in 2022. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a reply is not received within 10 days. </p></reply>

My Department is responsible for coordinating Government support for potential bids for major international sports events and, in line with the Programme for Government, it is currently developing a Major International Sports Events policy which will guide future Government support for these events.</p>  <p>  Over recent years Ireland has won the bids to host Ryder Cup 2027, EURO 2020 and the Women&rsquo;s Rugby World Cup and engaged in a bid for Rugby World Cup 2023.

In regard to a potential joint bid to host the 2028 UEFA EURO championships, Minister Martin and I will need to have a clearer understanding of the costs and benefits of jointly hosting the event before making any decision to support a bid.  To that end the Department is engaging closely with the FAI in order to better evaluate the case for bidding for Euro 2028 and no commitments have been made at this point. </p></reply>

Ireland's strong global reputation for creativity brings many benefits to our country including the encouraging of tourism, education and business interests. Representatives from Tourism Ireland, The Arts Council, Screen Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs serve on the Expert Advisory Committee of Culture Ireland and work to ensure that there is a joined up approach to maximise the outcomes from the promotion of Irish artists globally.</p>  <p>  Culture Ireland has the primary responsibility for the promotion of Irish arts and artists globally and  through its Grant Programmes and special initiatives Culture Ireland works to support the presentation of  Irish artists to audiences worldwide.  I am delighted that with the lifting of restrictions, I can once again support Irish artists to travel globally to present their work in person.</p>  <p>  The upcoming St Patrick's Day period offers an exceptional opportunity to highlight Ireland on the world stage. In addition to Culture Ireland support for artists travelling, there is continuing support for artists to present their work virtually, reaching territories where Irish artists may not generally travel. Next week I will announce a special Culture Ireland programme, SEODA, which is a 5 day online festival of some of Ireland's Irish artists.</p>  <p>  At home visitors to Ireland can experience the St Patrick's Festival in person this year as well as a wealth of arts and culture programmes delivered by our National Cultural Institutions and artists and arts organisations with increased funding to the Arts Council and the live performance sector.</p>  <p>  I remain cognisant of the fact that the pandemic restrictions posed particular challenges for the arts and culture sector and for 2022  have put in place support of supports for the live entertainment sector in 2022 in addition to record funding for the Arts Council, ensuring Irish arts can be created for presentation nationally and internationally.</p></reply>

This represents the full reopening of our economy and our society, and is a crucial opportunity to return to work for those who work in the live entertainment and events sector.  I am heartened to see so many gigs and live events going ahead at the moment at full capacity, and it is great to see artists and crews back doing what they do best after two very difficult years. </p><p>  I was very cognisant of the challenges the restrictions caused for the arts/culture and live entertainment industry in 2021 and I provided grants of over &euro;55m to support the sector and drive employment opportunities for artists and crews, through the introduction of the following schemes:</p><p>  - Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS)</p><p>  - Events Sector Covid Support Scheme (ESCSS)</p><p>  - Local Live Performance Support Scheme (LLPSS)</p><p>  - Music and Entertainment Support Scheme (MEBAS)</p><p>  - Commercial Entertainment Capital Grant Scheme (CECGS)</p><p>  - St. Patrick's Festival</p><p>  These schemes provided thousands of hours of employment for artists and crews at a time when restrictions were such that there were no employment opportunities. The schemes also provided a pipeline of high quality artistic output.</p><p>  In 2022 I have put a number of supports in place to support the recovery of the live entertainment sector including the following:</p><p>  - &euro;5m for Live Performance Support Scheme Strand 2 &ndash; for pantomime and seasonal musical theatre events curtailed or cancelled in December 2021 and January 2022.

The pandemic demonstrated very clearly the critical role they play in social and economic well-being. The resilience of these sectors, in the face of the extraordinary circumstances of COVID-19 has been remarkable, particularly as many were among the first sectors to close and are the last to return to full capacity.</p>  <p>  I am greatly heartened at the response to and uptake of the various supports, both horizontal and sectoral, that have been put in place.  Recognising that resilience and the hugely important role that these sectors play in Ireland's collective economic and social well-being, I will continue to work with the stakeholders to monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors and, with officials and Government colleagues, to support a strong and stable recovery as we emerge from the pandemic.</p>  <p>  We all want to see a return to full capacities attending cultural and entertainment events and the rehabilitation of our hard-hit Night-Time Economy.</p>  <p>  As a Government, our commitment to the sector is evidenced by recent funding allocations, among them &euro;25m to pilot a Basic Income Scheme for Arts; record Arts Council funding and funding package for the Live Performance Sector.</p>  <p>  In the development and delivery of supports, both myself and my officials engage regularly with agencies and stakeholders through a dedicated forum established for this purpose.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision  in principle to extend the Creative Ireland Programme until 2027.  Creative Ireland was launched in 2017 as an all-of-government culture and wellbeing programme committed to the vision that every person should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential.</p>  <p>  Established as a legacy initiative of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, Creative Ireland collaborates across government and with arts, community and voluntary organisations to deploy creativity as a strategy for wellbeing, social cohesion and economic success.  Alongside its very successful Creative Youth initiative, the programme&rsquo;s Creative Communities partnership with the 31 local authorities, and their delivery of over 5,700 creative projects to date, has been key to enabling community-led nationwide engagement.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 published last year sets out the actions that my Department will take over the coming period to enrich the quality of life in Ireland through supporting the development of tourism, culture, arts, sports, media and Irish language.  In addition to their immense inherent value, these are valued by all of our communities as important resources for social cohesion, individual and community wellbeing and for the presentation of Ireland as an attractive destination for tourism and sustainable inward investment.</p>  <p>  In addition to the core Departmental goals set out in this document, a number of cross cutting-goals have been incorporated into the Department&rsquo;s objectives which will be reflected in our policies and programmes over the lifetime of this Statement of Strategy including supporting and promoting diversity, social inclusion and full and effective female participation across the Department&rsquo;s sectors and society in line with Programme for Government commitments.</p></reply>

The Code of Programme Standards developed by the BAI pursuant to section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out that broadcasters should exercise due care in broadcasting depictions and/or descriptions of violence in programme material. The Code also sets out that broadcasters shall have due regard to the appropriateness of and/or justification for the inclusion of violent content in programme material.</p><p>In regard to the portrayal of violence through social media and audiovisual-on-demand media services, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 will establish Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n as a multi-person Media Commission to include an Online Safety Commissioner. It will dissolve the BAI, establish regulatory frameworks for online safety and the regulation of audiovisual media services, and transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive.</p><p>The Bill will amend and extend the duties, codes and rules currently applicable to broadcasters under the Broadcasting Act 2009 to audiovisual-on-demand media services. Accordingly, the Bill will empower Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n to make codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by both broadcasters and audiovisual-on-demand media services. Under the Bill, An Coimisi&uacute;n may, in particular, make codes to ensure that programme material relating to gratuitous violence or sexual conduct is presented with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience and in such a way that children will not normally hear or see anything which may impair their physical, mental or moral development.</p><p>As regards content on other categories of online services, it will be the role of the Online Safety Commissioner to oversee the regulatory framework for online safety. As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how designated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms.</p><p>Among other categories of content, online safety codes will ensure that designated online services take appropriate measures to reduce the availability of offence-specific online content and cyber-bullying material on their services. The full list of offence-specific online content is set out in section 45 of the Bill and includes, for example, relevant offences under Coco&rsquo;s Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020. In the case of Coco's Law, it is intended that this will have the effect of reducing the availability, on designated online services, of intimate images which have been shared without consent and of threatening or grossly offensive communications about, or to, another person.</p><p>  In addition to instances of cyber-bullying which would be considered as offence-specific harmful online content, the online safety codes will also address serious cyber-bullying material which is not related to a criminal offence. In contrast to the category relating to offence-specific online content, the non offence-specific categories of content will be subject to a risk of harm test. Accordingly, such content will only be considered harmful online content under the Bill where it gives rise to any risk to a person&rsquo;s life, or a risk of significant harm to a person&rsquo;s physical or mental health.</p><p>Under the Bill, in the event of a failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, An Coimisi&uacute;n will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover.</p><p>Finally, the Bill will also allow An Coimisi&uacute;n to create non-binding guidance materials for providers of relevant online services. Such guidance materials may seek to protect children in particular, but also the general public, from harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content. The Bill provides for a definition of age-inappropriate online content which includes, in particular, content which consists of realistic representations of gross or gratuitous violence or acts of cruelty.</p></reply>

The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media is responsible for coordinating its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan and the second annual progress report published in October 2021 -  covering the 18 month period from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2020, present a clear overview of the 180 or so actions being advanced by c. 60 stakeholders in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions.</p>  <p>  A copy of the Action Plan, together with the progress report, can be found on the Department's website. The actions set out in the plan are presented around the nine specific areas of action as set out in the overarching strategy. Of particular interest to the Deputy will be Area of Action 2: An Ghaeltacht.</p>  <p>  I might also point out that an additional exchequer allocation of &euro;7m has been provided in Budget 2022 for the Irish language and Gaeltacht sectors, ultimately meaning that total funding in excess of &euro;85m is being deployed in support of the Irish language via my Department alone next year.</p>  <p>  A budget allocation of &euro;5.8m is being made available in 2022 to support the Language Planning Process.  This will enable my Department to fund both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge who are tasked under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 with supporting the language planning process.  It will also enable my Department to support, at a central level, organisations which operate in the Early Years and Childhood, Family and Traditional Arts sectors as an additional support to the language planning process.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides significant co-funding to Foras na Gaeilge to carry out its statutory mandate under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis. This funding, along with funding from the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, enables Foras na Gaeilge to provide support, advice and financial assistance to many community language groups and to its six lead organisations who are working to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 has recently been signed into law.  The primary purpose of the Act is to amend the Official Languages Act 2003 with a view to increasing and improving the provision of public services through the Irish language.

Additional information is available on the organisation's website: www.ealain.ie</p>  <p>  For the current year, the organisation is in receipt of &euro;1.2m from the partnership between  the Arts Council and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p>  <p>  In 2021, funding allocations were made by the organisation for the following:</p>  <p>  - 5 strategic projects throughout the Gaeltacht under the Coth&uacute; Scheme;</p>  <p>  - 18 Gaeltacht arts festivals;</p>  <p>  - 44 Gaeltacht artists received support through the organisation's Artists Bursary Scheme;</p>  <p>  - Over 35 small one-off events/projects; and,</p>  <p>  - 16 strategic arts projects, including visual arts, literature, stage shows, youth drama and residencies through the Arts Development Scheme.</p>  <p>  Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta deploys funding directly to artists, arts organisations, and community groups in the Gaeltacht via eight funding schemes and offers a range of soft supports to the sector including training, mentoring, advice, information-sharing and advocacy. The organisation engages in and facilitates a wide range of partnerships regionally, nationally, and internationally which increase opportunities in the arts sector for Gaeltacht communities and arts practitioners.</p>  <p>  In order to further promote and develop the language based arts in the Gaeltacht and to specifically support the language planning process and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, my Department has provided additional funding of up to &euro;1.5m to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta enabling the organisation to further support and create opportunities for the artistic community, especially the among the youth of the Gaeltacht.  A breakdown of my Department&rsquo;s additional funding is as follows:</p>  <p>  - &euro;1.275m was sanctioned by my Department in 2019 in order to support language-based arts classes and development opportunities in the various Language Planning Areas throughout the Gaeltacht over a three year period.  In the context of this programme, I also allocated a further &euro;50,000 recently to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta which will focus on promoting opportunities for young people taking part in the language-based arts classes to showcase their artistic talents outside the classroom environment.</p>  <p>  - As a separate initiative, I sanctioned an additional &euro;150,000 on a pilot basis to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta in 2021 enabling them to develop a drama programme directed at the youth in Gaeltacht areas.  This entails 700 hours of drama classes benefiting up to 230 pupils.  It also enables the organisation to conduct research and explore the activities and resources currently available to young people in the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  - This funding also enables Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta to employ an additional five co-ordinators to implement the programme (four full-time and one part-time) located in the various Gaeltacht regions.</p>  <p>  I might also point out that further funding of &euro;12,200 per annum was allocated to Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne to provide language-based arts classes in the West Kerry Gaeltacht, while many of the national initiatives funded under the Creative Ireland Programme are also available in the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to engage with relevant stakeholders including Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta in order to explore any opportunity arising for the artistic community, to build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector at present and to implement appropriate solutions for the future.</p></reply>

This new regime will be administered in due course by the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA), and by An Bord Plean&aacute;la (ABP) and the coastal local authorities.</p><p>This new marine planning system will replace existing State and development consent regimes (<i>i.e. </i>the existing foreshore system with the exception of the responsibilities of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine) and will streamline arrangements on the basis of a single consent principle, <i>i.e. </i>one state consent (Maritime Area Consent) to enable occupation of the Maritime Area and one development consent (planning permission), with a single environmental assessment.</p><p>Maritime Area Consents (MACs) will be granted by MARA. Development consent responsibility for coastal areas will be generally discharged by the relevant local authority within a newly designated nearshore area i.e. from the high water mark 3nm seaward. ABP will be responsible for certain classes of development within the entire Maritime Area and for the generality of development beyond the nearshore.</p><p>The MAP Act also sets out special provisions for offshore renewable energy (ORE) projects satisfying the definition of &ldquo;relevant maritime usage&rdquo;. Recognising that it will take time to establish a new agency, it was decided by Government that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications should be granted limited powers to invite MAC applications for ORE projects satisfying the definition of &ldquo;relevant maritime usage&rdquo; for a specified period in advance of the establishment of MARA. A public consultation on these processes was held recently by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and applications for MACs from these projects will be accepted later this year. Any project satisfying the definition of &ldquo;relevant maritime usage&rdquo; which is granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new regime. </p><p>The aim is to have MARA established by Q1 2023 and, to facilitate this, a dedicated Unit has been set up within my Department to progress the Implementation Plan to establish this new agency. Extensive preparatory work will be required over the coming months to enable MARA to undertake the wide range of its statutory functions post-establishment. This work includes drafting commencement orders, and preparing a series of regulations and statutory guidelines as well as developing the processes dependent on same.  </p><p>In the interim period, responsibility for development on Ireland&rsquo;s foreshore will continue to be regulated under the provisions of the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended. As Minister, I am the &lsquo;appropriate Minister&rsquo; for the purposes of this Act (with the exception of a number of specific areas of responsibility for which the Minister for Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine is the appropriate Minister), and I will continue to accept, assess and grant/refuse applications for foreshore leases and licences under the foreshore regime until MARA is established. After the establishment of MARA, new applications will not be accepted under the current Foreshore consenting regime, but applications on hand (e.g. site investigation applications etc.) will be processed to completion.</p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number and complexity of foreshore licence and lease applications over the last two to three years. The majority of this increased activity is related to Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) infrastructural development, including potential development site investigation activity, Eirgrid cabling development, and port infrastructure improvement. In addition, power and telecommunication cable application activity has increased from both commercial and state-led projects. In parallel, emerging case law and enhanced requirements arising from various environmental assessment Directives have added to the complexity of the appraisal process. </p><p>Over the last eighteen months, my Department has more than doubled the staffing resources available within the Foreshore Unit to address the increasing workload. In addition, a panel of external specialist environmental consultants is in operation to assist in the technical assessment of applications. While I am satisfied that the appropriate resources are in place, I am keen to keep the arrangements under review until such time as the MARA is established.</p><p>Under the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021, MARA will also, in due course, undertake all administrative responsibility and estate management functions for the portfolio of existing foreshore leases and licences (numbering in excess of 2,200).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-24a.715.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022400073#WRS03000"><p>The Climate Action Plan, 2021 sets out an ambitious course for national decarbonisation to deliver a scale-up in emission performance across the sectors over the coming decade to meet 2030 targets and to set a trajectory to meet 2050 objectives. The plan recognises that climate change is a complex issue that requires transformative responses from every sector in society and that all measures, collectively, represent a coherent approach to dealing with the significant challenges ahead.</p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (NPF) confirms that the planning process provides an established means through which to implement and integrate climate change objectives, including adaptation, at local level and the transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society. The NPF further underpins this approach by stating that "in addition to legally binding targets agreed at EU level, it is a national objective for Ireland to transition to be a competitive low carbon, economy by the year 2050".</p>  <p>  The three Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) also echo the importance of climate action and each contain a number of policy objectives in order to ensure emissions can be reduced and targets met.</p>  <p>  Under the relevant provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) (the Act), local authorities prepare development plans and local area plans to set out the planning policies and objectives for their respective functional areas. </p>  <p>  A programme of development plan review is currently underway in order to achieve consistency of approach with the NPF and the RSESs adopted by the three Regional Assemblies. </p>  <p>  National renewable energy objectives, and those set out in the regional strategies, are required to be reflected in county Development Plans. </p>  <p>  In addition, section 10(2) of the Act sets out the development objectives that must be included in the development plan of each local authority and are therefore &lsquo;mandatory&rsquo; requirements. Section 10(2)(n) specifically identifies climate action (adaption and mitigation) as a mandatory objective to be included in all Development Plans. </p>  <p>  These plans, which are adopted by the elected members of the local authority, are subject to review and evaluation by the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) to ensure consistency with national planning policy and guidance, including section 28 Ministerial Guidelines. Where matters arise in relation to consistency with national policy, further to a recommendation by the OPR, the Minister may decide to issue a planning authority with a Ministerial Direction under Section 31 of the Act, if a plan has failed to set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of an area.</p>  <p>  The SEAI published a Methodology for Local Authority Renewable Energy Strategies (LARES) in 2013 to assist local authorities in this regard. This methodology is currently being reviewed, with input from relevant bodies, to provide a best practice approach to identifying and assessing renewable energy resources in spatial planning at local authority level. Based on the indicative targets for onshore wind energy and grid-scale solar deployment, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) proposes to set out a target for the total onshore capacity that should be planned for on a national and regional level. The Regional Assemblies will be required to develop and implement regional renewable electricity strategies based on the overall national targets, renewable energy objectives contained in each of the RSESs, with the support of relevant guidance, including the SEAI LARES.</p>  <p>  With regard to the construction sector, embodied carbon in construction materials makes a significant contribution to the lifetime carbon emissions of new buildings. The operational carbon emissions for heating, lighting and other services have been significantly reduced in Nearly Zero Energy Buildings. These building regulations requirements apply to all new buildings including social and affordable housing developments.  Currently these embodied carbon emissions are addressed in the Climate Action Plan and the Construction Products Regulation.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department has issued design guidelines for sustainable housing which includes recommendations relating to the need to have due regard to the environmental impact of construction materials. These guidelines &ldquo;Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities&rdquo; are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/24d9e-quality-housing-for-sustainable-communities-design-guidelines/</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Climate Action Plan the Office of Public Works (OPW) is putting in place a roadmap to promote greater use of lower-carbon building material alternatives in construction while the SEAI is carrying out a research and development project to examine life cycle analysis and embedded energy in buildings to compare the use of sustainable materials.</p>  <p>  It should be further noted in this connection that planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, under sections 34 and 143 of the Act respectively, are required to have regard to the objectives of Development Plans and any policies of Government or Guidelines issued with respect to climate targets which are relevant at the time of making a decision on a proposed development.</p></reply>

While it has not been possible to immediately update all affected applications on the tracker, this will happen automatically when these applications reach the next stage of the process. The passport service apologies for any inconvenience caused to applicants who have been affected.  </p>  <p>  Applicants who wish to receive an update on the status of their passport application can contact the Customer Service Hub at (01) 6711633 or via Webchat on my Department's website (www.dfa.ie/passports). The Passport Service Customer Service Hub officers respond to customer queries by phone and webchat as well as enquiries related to Emergency Passport cases. The Customer Service Hub are currently handling over 5,000 customer contacts each week. During times of high demand, there can be delays in getting through to a service agent due to the volumes of enquiries. The Passport Service webchat is also operational and customers should refresh the page if the icon is grey. A webchat operator is available when the icon is green. </p>  <p>  My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months. Since June of 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service. Additional staff are being assigned on a weekly basis with a goal of reaching staff numbers of 900 by the end of March. This represents a doubling of staff numbers over the course of 9 months. 109 new staff joined the Passport Service in the month of January. This is slightly lower than the estimate that was originally provided, as not all assignments that had been offered were accepted by candidates. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service:</p>  <p>  - Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications.</p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time.</p>  <p>  - A new document management process is being put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application.</p>  <p>  In January 2022, the Passport Service received over 137,000 new passport applications. This is the highest volume of monthly applications ever received and indicates that there is pent-up demand for passports following the relaxation of necessary travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Passport Service estimates that up to 1.4 million passport applications will be received this year. Previous predictions for 2022 estimated a volume of 1.7m. However, for now this number has decreased due to the volume of passport renewal applications received in late 2021. The prediction for the number of passport applications in 2022 remains subject to review and the first six months of the year are still forecasted to remain very busy with most of the reduction in forecasted volume seen in the second half of the year.  </p>  <p>  While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. There is a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day. Figures show that there are currently 90,000 applications that are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. There are also 70,000 applications in the system where the Passport Service is waiting for the customer to complete the application. In these cases, the onus is on the customer to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.</p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this:</p>  <p>  - It is important to check the applicant&rsquo;s identity and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries. This is something we can all be proud of. However, in order to maintain this ranking and to protect the integrity of the Irish passport, the Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.</p>  <p>  - In the case of children, it is essential that the Passport Service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue. This ensures that the Passport Service protects the rights of the child and their guardians.</p>  <p>  - Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently processing 45% of adult online renewal application in one working day, while 99% of online child renewal passports are issued within the advertised processing time of 15 working days. </p>  <p>  The processing times for a standard online renewal passport applications compare very favourably to processing times internationally in countries such as the UK, United States, Canada and Australia.</p></reply>

First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. </p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. </p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p>  <p>  Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process. In cases of children whose parents are not Irish citizens, the process can sometimes take longer due to the need to ensure that all of the required supporting documentation to prove the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is submitted and correct. Due to the high level of complexity with these particular applications, further documentation is often required adding to the processing time.</p>  <p>  My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive that has been underway for several months.

Currently, over 1.4m passport applications are anticipated this year compared to the previous pre-Covid-19 annual high of 935,000 in 2019. This is due to pent-up demand following Covid-19 public health restrictions over the past two years. Previous predictions for 2022 estimated a volume of 1.7m. However, for now this number has decreased due to the volume of passport renewal applications received in late 2021.

Of these, 20,000 are first time applications made within the State. While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. There is a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day. Figures show that, of the total 160,000 applications in the system, 90,000 (57%) applications are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 70,000 (43%) applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. </p>  <p>  I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p><font color="#001A26">- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be orioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">  - As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE web</font>site, ncse.ie/for-schools</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website. www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

This support was vitally important to ensure that our schools remained open for pupils. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that a framework for adapted School Placement arrangements was developed by the Department of Education and the Teaching Council, together with the relevant Initial Teacher Education (ITE) providers, in order to ensure that student teachers at primary level could continue to support schools during periods of planned school placement from the beginning of January up to the February mid-term break. During this period, student teachers continued to be located in their host school for school placement, but were also available to support other schools where required. </p>  <p>  The Education Stakeholders, including the Department of Education, HEIs providing initial teacher education (ITE) and the Teaching Council, have continued to work together to maintain the integrity of the students&rsquo; ITE experiences and support students in satisfactorily completing their ITE programmes.</p>  <p>  The adapted School Placement arrangements were an exceptional measure introduced as part of a suite of measures to support schools to minimise the risk associated with COVID-19 and in light of the prevalence of the Omicron variant, with the understanding that these would be unwound as soon as possible. The Department understands that student teachers will now return to experiencing the more typical School Placement arrangements, and associated assessments, which are a critical part of their ITE programmes. </p>  <p>  While the adapted School Placement arrangements are no longer in place, student teachers will, if they wish, still be able to support schools by providing substitution cover when they have availability outside of their ITE programme requirements.</p></reply>

These are designed to maintain quality of service delivery over the service period, in most cases 25 years. </p>  <p>  To fund these services the Department issues monthly unitary payments, as a result PPP schools are not eligible to apply for Emergency Works, Summer Works or the receipt of a Minor Works Grant. </p>  <p>  Due to exceptional circumstances in 2020 PPP schools were granted a once off minor works grant. Circa &euro;2.4 million issued to PPP schools to assist in their work on the full implementation of COVID-19 Response Plan. These works may have included, but were not limited to, reconfiguration of classroom space, re-purposing rooms to provide additional space, adapting storage facilities, purchasing furniture, altering desk layouts, adapting toilet areas, short term rental of additional space and so on. All of which would lie outside the prevailing building management service for PPP schools.</p>  <p>  In December 2021 an enhanced minor works grant issued to eligible schools to enable them to address small-scale ventilation improvements. With regard to PPP school, items such as windows and vents fall under the prevailing building management service. As a result PPP schools did not automatically qualify for the enhanced minor works grant. However, it is accepted that some PPP schools may require works to improve ventilation outside the remit of the prevailing building management service and will therefore be considered for financial assistance on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

It provides a bridge to help pupils make the transition from a highly-structured environment to one where they will take greater responsibility for their own learning and decision making. TY students participate in learning strategies which are active and experiential and which help them to develop a range of transferable critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills. Transition Year also provides an opportunity for students to reflect on and develop an awareness of the value of education and training in preparing them for the ever-changing demands of the adult world of work and relationships. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) provide guidance on TY via a handbook that is available on their Website:  ncca.ie/en/senior-cycle/programmes-and-key-skills/transition-year/  However, the structure of TY programmes, including the balance between classroom and non-classroom based units, is a matter for individual schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, between 2016 and 2020 the NCCA undertook an extensive review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways. The NCCA&rsquo;s Advisory Report on the Senior Cycle has been submitted to my Department for consideration.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Report, which includes consideration of the TY Programme, maps out, in broad terms, an ambitious programme of work, which would enable the development and construction of the components that would make up a Framework for Senior Cycle and will involve further ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation. Research published during the review by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) revealed that students, teachers and parents all viewed the TY programme as a positive feature of senior cycle, with the year perceived as enhancing maturity and personal development among students, providing them with a variety of learning experiences and allowing them to reflect on their pathways for the future. </p>  <p>  I am currently focusing on what the implementation of the NCCA Report would involve and what we can do to best ensure the further evolution of Senior Cycle.  My officials and I have been considering the Report carefully, with a view to delivering a Senior Cycle programme that meets the needs of the students of today and the future, and the Report will be published once those considerations are complete. </p></reply>

The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), introduced in 2016, enables the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities/additional needs in the ECCE Programme.  The goal of AIM is to create a more inclusive environment in pre-schools, so all children, regardless of ability, can benefit from quality early learning and care. A diagnosis of autism (or other disabilities/additional needs) is not required to access AIM supports. However, pre-school children with a diagnosis are generally supported in mainstream pre-schools with additional supports provided through AIM where required. </p><p>NCSE sanctions the establishment of special classes, including ASD Early Intervention (EI) classes where there is an identified need. I understand that, on occasion, EI classes are re-designated as school-age special classes to reflect the changing age-profile of students, the changing needs in an area and in order to ensure a continuation of support for students in the EI class who require a special class placement.</p><p>As referenced above, ASD EI classes are generally re-designated, not closed.

These schools have reduced class sizes and provide specialist supports in line with the children&rsquo;s needs.  </p><p>There are extensive education supports in place to support children who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing.  These include:</p><p>- the provision of funding to provide ISL tuition for children and their families</p><p>- additional teaching and care supports in school in line with need</p><p>-  assistive technology to enable students access and engage the school curriculum</p><p>- supports provided by the National Council for Special Education which include the Visiting Teachers for students who are Deaf / Hard of Hearing (VTDHH) who work with students and their families and their schools</p><p>- professional development for teachers</p><p>The NCSE can also give approval to a school to appoint a communication worker who is required to have an appropriate level of proficiency in ISL.  This person will support students whose main language is ISL to assess the curriculum and participate in school life. </p><p>The Irish Sign Language Act 2017 imposes obligations on state bodies in relation to the provision of supports and services for people whose primary language is ISL.</p><p>In particular, the Act imposes a number of obligations on the Minister for Education in relation to the provision of ISL supports for students and their families.  </p><p>Work is underway in the Department on these supports and the statutory schemes required under the Act  . </p><p>It is expected that the proposals which are currently at an advanced stage of development will enhance current provision for children whose primary means of communication is through ISL. </p><p>An announcement will be made on the matter shortly.</p></reply>

Aside from the wider legal issues regarding the status of marriage and civil partnerships, which is a much broader policy area than its implications for the income support schemes of  my Department, extending the current provisions to people who have not undertaken equivalent legal obligations would carry significant costs and also raise significant issues about criteria if it were to be based upon cohabitation. </p><p>Therefore, any decision to extend the qualifying criteria for the widow(er)&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner's pension, be it contributory or non-contributory, would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations, as well as any legal issues that may arise. </p><p>Officials in my Department are in the process of carrying out a review into the treatment of cohabiting couples in the Social Welfare system.

In addition to improvements in core social welfare rates, there were a number of targeted measures designed to support those most vulnerable to poverty, including increases to the Fuel Allowance and Living Alone Allowance. As energy prices were increasing, I ensured that the increase to the Fuel Allowance rate was implemented from Budget week. I also broadened eligibility for the scheme.</p>  <p>  As a result of these targeted measures, many of the most vulnerable pensioners have seen larger increases in 2022. For example, a pensioner in receipt of fuel allowance, living alone, will see an increase of &euro;13 per week during the fuel season due to measures introduced in Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department, in as targeted a manner as possible.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment are required to satisfy a means test, while recipients of non-contributory payments are accepted as satisfying the means test.</p>  <p>  The amount of means allowed to qualify for fuel allowance is the equivalent of the current maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory) (SPC) including any increases, plus &euro;120. This means for example, that a person in receipt of SPC, with a qualifying spouse, may have a total weekly income of just over &euro;600 and still qualify for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure measures costing in excess of a half a billion Euro, which will have a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.</p>  <p>  The measures include an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125, which will be paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment. It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.</p>  <p>  As such, this lump sum payment is intended to target the most vulnerable pensioners, as well as other social welfare recipients, to ensure that they are protected against rising fuel costs.</p>  <p>  This payment, in addition to the Budget increase to the Fuel Allowance, will mean low-income households see an increase of 41% this Fuel Allowance season compared to the last season.</p>  <p>  While not all pensioners will benefit from this lump sum payment, every household in the State will receive an Energy Credit of &euro;200, which will to be applied to electricity bills.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to monitor this situation carefully. </p></reply>

An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time.

Analysis conducted by the ESRI in 2021 has shown that the pandemic supports provided by the Government were effective in mitigating the poverty impacts for those with low incomes. The reduction in demand for ENPs is consistent with the ESRI analysis.</p><p>I would encourage any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an exceptional or urgent needs payment to contact their local Intreo Centre. There is a national Income Support Helpline in place - 0818-800024 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counteract the negative impact of anti-social behaviour on community morale and quality of life. This has included two subgroups established to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, in the absence of the identification of specific offences or the circumstances in which such offending occurs, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the question posed.</p><p>The primary legislation that provides for antisocial behaviour and public order offences is contained in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as amended. Many of the offences specified in that Act are &ldquo;Summary Offences&rdquo; and, while a person may be arrested in certain circumstances, there would not be a provision that permits detention for questioning of the person arrested. </p><p>Section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 2017 amended the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 by inserting Section 4A. This provided that where a person is arrested for offences under Section 24 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, or for common law breach of the peace, that person may be detained in custody for such periods not exceeding 6 hours if the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the time being in charge of the Garda station is of the opinion that the person is intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger himself or herself, or other persons. A person so detained cannot be questioned during this period, it is a detention for their own safety and the safety of others.</p><p>Certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 are deemed &ldquo;Indictable Offences&rdquo;. If the penalty on conviction for such offence is one that carries 5 years or more of imprisonment, then it also qualifies as an &ldquo;Arrestable Offence&rdquo;. Examples under the Act are the offences of Riot as contrary to Section 14, Violent Disorder as contrary to Section 15, and Affray as contrary to Section 16.  Where a person has been arrested for those offences, and where certain circumstances arise, that person can be considered for detention and questioning under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 as amended. Whether a person is so detained will rest on a number of factors to be considered by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na referred to as the &ldquo;member in charge&rdquo;.</p><p>Under current legislation, the total period for which a person may be detained under Section 4 of the 1984 Act is 24 hours. Detention for the full 24 hour period will be subject to assessment at 6 and 12 hours, and will only arise if continued detention is required for the full and proper investigation of the offence among other considerations.</p><p>The periods of detention referenced above are set out in the table below for ease of reference. <table>    <tr>       <th>Section 4 &ndash; Sanctioned by</th>       <th>Detention Period</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Member In Charge</td>       <td>6 Hours</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Superintendent</td>       <td>6 Hours</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Chief Superintendent</td>       <td>12 Hours</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>24 Hours</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that detention is a highly regulated process and that significant measures exist to protect the individual rights of a person so detained. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-24a.908.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022400077#WRW04600"><p>I condemn the recent incidents that have occurred around the country in the strongest possible terms. My thoughts are with the victims of these attacks. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, sentencing is a matter solely within the discretion of the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances of the case and of the accused and subject to any limits as may be prescribed by law for a particular offence. The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender; in that process, identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie, and then applying any mitigating factors.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the Judicial Council, which was established on 17 December 2019, is an independent body made up of all of the judges in Ireland. The Council constitutes a separate and independent branch of Government.  The Council has established a Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee which includes 5 lay people. </p><p>The Committee is focused on:</p><p>- promoting consistency in sentences imposed by the courts;</p><p>- the impact of sentencing decisions on victims;</p><p>- the need to promote public confidence in the criminal justice system;</p><p>- the relative effectiveness of them in preventing reoffending.</p><p>I understand that the Council has initiated a review of all sentencing guidelines under the Judicial Council Act 2019 and that information relating to this review is available on the Council's website at www.judicialcouncil.ie.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place in Ireland with respect to knife crime, including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned. Indeed, the maximum penalty in the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years in an amendment introduced via the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p><p>Legislative responses alone will not provide a ready solution and evidence from other jurisdictions indicate that simply adopting harsher penalties will not lead to a reduction in the incidence of these crimes. Our existing five-year sentence for knife possession is longer than in the UK, for example, where a four-year penalty applies.  It is important to note that there are no quick-fix solutions, based on international experience, and longer term, evidence-based strategies are needed. The issue of knife crime is currently being examined by a subgroup of the Antisocial Behaviour Forum, which is assessing available evidence to inform both legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices with regard to the issue. The work of this subgroup is ongoing and is expected to conclude in Q1 2022.</p><p>While the specific offences of 'serious assault' and 'grievous bodily harm' are not listed in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, (1997), the Deputy may wish to note that the Act provides for the following:</p><p>- A fine and/or in imprisonment for up to 6 months for persons convicted of assault. </p><p>- An unlimited fine and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years for persons convicted of assault causing harm.</p><p>- An unlimited fine and/or a period of life imprisonment for persons convicted of causing serious harm.</p></reply>

Furthermore, &euro;4.7 million has been provided on a recurring basis since 2021 to fund an additional 24 beds at Crumlin and Temple street, and 2 high dependency unit beds at Crumlin. These beds will facilitate the increase in activity needed to reduce paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. A further &euro;4 million has been committed for a theatre expansion programme across CHI sites to focus on paediatric orthopaedics. Capital funding of &euro;4 million has been designated to support this initiative, which is included within the 2022 Capital Plan due to be approved shortly. Finally, &euro;2 million has been provided for outsourcing initiatives for both inpatient and daycase procedures, as well as to meet radiology needs.

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to those staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites. The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (eg: nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so. </p>  <p>  There are many, many other individuals and organisations in our country who did so much during the pandemic. While I and the Government are sincerely grateful for this commitment, it is appropriate that public sector frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. They found themselves exposed to particular COVID-19 risks that did not exist in other work environments or for those working from home.

One of the central priorities for me as Minister for Health is that waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures are improved, and that children receive the care that they need and deserve in a timely and appropriate fashion. In particular, a special area of focus for me and my Department is that of paediatric orthopaedics.</p><p>In January I asked the HSE to develop a dedicated plan to tackle scoliosis waiting lists this year.  Earlier this month I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss the finalisation of the proposals to increase orthopaedic activity at CHI. The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.</p><p>This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided to a value of &euro;19 million in 2022 to support this initiative.</p><p>More specifically, &euro;3.4 million has been committed to support additional activity at Cappagh Orthopaedic hospital. This is the full year requirement associated with the &euro;1.65 million that was provided from the Access to Care Fund in 2021 to support CHI paediatric orthopaedic activity at Cappagh. Furthermore, &euro;4.7 million has been provided on a recurring basis since 2021 to fund an additional 24 beds at Crumlin and Temple street, and 2 high dependency unit beds at Crumlin. These beds will facilitate the increase in activity needed to reduce paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. A further &euro;4 million has been committed for a theatre expansion programme across CHI sites to focus on paediatric orthopaedics. Capital funding of &euro;4 million has been designated to support this initiative, which is included within the 2022 Capital Plan due to be approved shortly. Finally, &euro;2 million has been provided for outsourcing initiatives for both inpatient and daycase procedures, as well as to meet radiology needs. Plans are currently being finalised by CHI in this regard.</p><p>Further details of the breakdown of these funds are provided for the Deputy in the attached document. Some of these figures are initial estimates and as such are subject to final review, agreement and potential revision on receipt of the detailed operational plan for delivery of this important initiative.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; Parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. While there are no plans currently to extend the list of conditions covered, the LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. </p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;100 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The maximum payable under the Drugs Payment Scheme will be further reduced to &euro;80 per month from 1 March 2022. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. </p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

In addition, &euro;3.2 million of the &euro;9.1 million investment came from co-funding by the Irish charity Research Motor Neuron and European Joint Programming Initiatives, in particular the Joint Programme in Neurodegenerative Diseases which the HRB has been supporting participation in since 2011. Given the global impact of motor neuron disease, joining forces with European partners gives Irish researchers access to expertise and infrastructures outside of Ireland to advance their research.</p>  <p>  Research has variously focused on gaining a better understanding of the causes of ALS; looking for diagnostic tools and potential treatments; population-based analysis of the environmental and genetic factors in ALS; healthcare and palliative needs, services and outcomes for patients with ALS; and improving cognition and daily function. In terms of active awards, the HRB has commitments of &euro;1.4 million for research specific to ALS and plan to participate in upcoming Joint Programme in Neurodegenerative Diseases in the coming years, as well as supporting ALS research through its own schemes. </p>  <p>  The HRB has invested a further &euro;8.4 million since 2012 on research into understanding the aetiology of neurodegeneration more broadly and the most appropriate approach to services, with almost half (&euro;4.8 million) of that investment in awards that are currently active. Of this funding, &euro;6.8 million was co-funding from Wellcome Trust and European Joint funding programmes.</p>  <p>  All funding schemes are run as open, competitive calls and all eligible applications are internationally peer-reviewed by experts in the field. Only those deemed to be of high quality, and for which funding is available, are supported. Given that the HRB disburses public monies, this is a very important process to enhance the possibility of positive outcomes from the research, and guard against waste and unusable research results. The HRB does not ring-fence funding for specific conditions and applications in all disease areas are welcome.</p>  <p>  The Research Motor Neuron Ireland website (rmn.ie/current-research/) also lists an extensive list of research projects and funding sources, including the Health Research Board, through the HRB-HRCI Joint Funding Scheme. </p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. The Department is not in a position to comment on individual cases, but can offer reassurance that full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p></reply>

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Last year the Department published the NTPF Review of the Pricing System for Private Nursing Homes, as well as the Value for Money Review of nursing home care costs. Significant work is underway to deliver the recommendations of both reviews. This will involve significant research, policy analysis and development work, and an extensive input from clinical, economic, and legal sources. The implementation of the recommendations will also have regard to other recent reports, including the final report published by the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel.</p>  <p>  Following a similar review process, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, was signed into law on 22 July 2021 and became operational in October, which introduced further safeguards into the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses. It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care. This removed a disincentive against the sale of properties that might otherwise remain vacant. The Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the Housing for All Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties "in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people". </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and I remain committed to ensuring that the NHSS will continue to deliver value for money in the provision of nursing home care as well as ensuring the provision of care which is affordable for residents and their families and appropriate to the needs of nursing home residents.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>&euro;350m is being allocated in 2022 to the HSE and the NTPF to primarily provide additional public and private activity to further stabilise and reduce scheduled care waiting lists and waiting times in tandem with bringing forward much needed longer-term reforms. This will supplement the core activity of the HSE as detailed in the HSE National Service Plan (NSP) 2022.</p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The taskforce will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan. </p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in my Department.

HIQA subsequently referred these allegations to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  These referrals were in addition to the measures taken by HIQA requiring the provider to implement actions to ensure the safety of residents. All safeguarding issues are reviewed as a matter of priority to determine the most appropriate regulatory action. In situations where substantiated safeguarding issues are identified, providers are required to take action to ensure the safety of residents. If immediate risks to the safety of residents are identified, providers must take immediate action to address these issues and to prevent a recurrence. </p>  <p>  In all situations, including the six referred to above, the Chief Inspector continues to monitor the actions of the provider to ensure they are effective in addressing the safeguarding concerns. The Chief Inspector can, and has, taken further action, up to and including the cancellation of registration, where providers fail to sustain improvements to residents&rsquo; safety.</p>  <p>  Consistent with best practice and to protect the privacy of residents, it would not be appropriate for HIQA to make further comment on individual centres outside the inspection process.</p>  <p>  I would like to again acknowledge my appreciation for HIQA&rsquo;s support for, and its contribution to, my Department's ongoing work to develop national policy and legislation on adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector. </p></reply>

The new facility will accommodate up to 17,000 outpatient and 25,000 emergency care attendances per year.</p><p>  Together with the Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital, which opened in July 2019, these new facilities will improve access to urgent, emergency and outpatient care for a significant number of children. In 2021, there were over 13,300 outpatient attendances at Connolly and almost 11,400 patients presented for urgent care.</p><p>Work on the St James&rsquo;s site is ongoing and progressing well with major milestones reached in 2021, including the completion of the concrete frame with over 150,000 cubic metres of concrete poured, the topping out of the building (where the highest point on the building was completed- a significant milestone in any construction project), the infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame, the closing in of the concourse and approximately 17,000 square metres of glazing and 5,800 square metres of external fa&ccedil;ade installed. </p><p>To date, 86,000 square metres of internal partitions have been installed, with the equivalent of over 26 kilometres installed in 2021, and the fit out of most internal areas is now underway, including the south fingers comprising Outpatients, Cardiology Wards, and Therapies spaces, and the &lsquo;Hot Block&rsquo; comprising Emergency Department, Critical Care and Theatres. Work in 2022 will be focused on the progression of the internal fit-out of the over 6,000 internal spaces.</p><p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) has advised that the main contractor&rsquo;s current programme schedule outlines completion can be achieved by December 2023 which would mean the NCH at St James&rsquo;s could open in the second half of 2024, after the necessary commissioning period. The NPHDB is working to ensure that contractor will meet its own schedule.</p><p>In 2018, Government approved a capital budget of &euro;1.433bn for the NCH project. This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. The capital budget has not yet been depleted and, to date, &euro;924.4m of the &euro;1.433bn budget has been drawn down for works on the project across the three sites.</p><p>There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes, and the Employment Order.</p><p>Additional costs in relation to the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites brings the total programme cost to &euro;1.73 billion. This includes investment in ICT, including a new Electronic Health Record system, the Children's Hospital Integration Programme (the merging of three paediatric hospitals) including commissioning, and pre-2013 project expenditure relating to the former Mater project.</p><p>Brexit and the global pandemic have severely impacted supply chains and NCH project is not immune to these external challenges. Every effort is being taken to mitigate the risks but these externalities beyond the control of the contractor and the NPHDB make speculation and more definitive forecasting unwise.</p><p>The NPHDB has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building, and equipping the new children's hospital. This includes assessment and defence of claims/ disputes submitted by the contractor under the construction contract.  I have therefore referred this element of your question to the NPHDB for direct reply.</p></reply>

In the National Service Plan 2020, the affordable limit for December 2020 was identified as 121,311 WTE, excluding centrally held and development funding, and 123,701 WTE including centrally held and development funding. This equates to an increase of 1,494 WTE or 3,884 WTE over end 2019 levels. These were initial estimates of affordability limits which were to be further developed and finalised alongside the Department of Health in the finalisation of the Pay and Numbers Strategy 2020. </p>  <p>  Due to the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, there was an immediate need to increase the health sector workforce on a temporary, emergency basis. Putting a limit on recruitment was no longer appropriate, and many recruitment avenues were utilised to ensure the health service was adequately staffed. The priority for the remainder of 2020 was therefore the need to expand the workforce to meet the demands of the health service.</p>  <p>  2020 saw an increase of an additional 6,357 WTE, which is the largest annual increase in staffing since the foundation of the HSE.</p></reply>

The Pay and Numbers Strategy for 2021 identified a recruitment target of an additional 14,567 WTE across all staff categories and service areas in 2021. </p>  <p>  The National Service Plan was underpinned by the assumption that there would be no greater than Level 3 COVID-19 measures and excluded a National Vaccination Programme rollout. The COVID-19 surge in Q1, coupled with significant demand for testing and tracing and unprecedented levels of COVID-19 related absence rates, significantly impacted the HSE&rsquo;s ability to recruit in the first quarter. In addition, a National Vaccination Programme was rolled out with the immediate establishment of mass vaccination centres across the country, which required a large amount of external recruitment capacity. Through third party recruitment agencies, the HSE recruited approximately 3,000 people in COVID-19 vaccination centres and for test and trace operations. These recruits are excluded from recruitment targets as they are not directly employed by the HSE.</p>  <p>  While the target of 14,567 was pursued strongly by the HSE, it was agreed mid-year that the targets under the Pay and Numbers Strategy for 2021 should be reduced given a shortfall in the beginning months of the year. The target was revised down to an additional 7,370 WTE by the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  In 2021, there was an increase of 6,149 WTE. This is the second largest annual increase in staffing since the foundation of the HSE, after 2020. Recruitment targets not achieved in 2021 form part of recruitment targets for 2022 and are included in the upper recruitment target of approximately 10,000 in 2022.</p></reply>

However, there are a range of targets set out in the draft National Service Plan. The targeted recruitment for this year continues to address any identified staff shortages across grades and service areas.</p>  <p>  Discussions between the Department and HSE officials agreed that, due to the current challenging recruitment environment, 5,500 WTE is a more achievable target for 2022. The upper affordable limit of 10,000 WTE is not seen as undeliverable, but rather one that will be ambitious and challenging to achieve, given the risks affecting labour supply. It is worth noting that these recruitment targets are additional WTE and do not include the replacement of existing staff who retire/leave during the year.</p>  <p>  The HSE identified the more realistic recruitment target of 5,500 WTE alongside a more challenging &lsquo;stretch&rsquo; target of 10,000 WTE set out in the National Service Plan. The Department has been working closely with the HSE to assess potential savings and further decisions on how this funding will be used will be taken. Actual recruitment will, as always, be monitored by the HSE and the Department throughout the course of the year under the governance and oversight arrangements in place.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7. My officials and the HSE are already engaged in preparatory work, and I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the IMO, representing GPs, later this quarter, after which engagement can commence with the IMO.

REAP incentivises farmers to maintain and improve the environmental condition of their land while delivering an important financial support to farmers.</p>  <p>  The programme will run to the end of 2022 and there are currently 3,740 participants in REAP, none of whom applied to afforest their land in January 2022</p>  <p>  At applications stage, farmers could bring in between 2ha and 10ha of land with partnerships permitted to bring in up to 30ha.  Almost 32,000ha of land has been assessed and scored under the 2021 REAP programme to establish its environmental condition. Farmers will work with their advisers to undertake environmental improvement works on the land that can increase the environmental score in year two. REAP will focus on improving existing farm features rather than the creation of new features and habitats. Farms with higher environmental scores will receive larger payments.</p>  <p>  While parcels brought into REAP may not be converted to forestry during the term of the REAP contract, afforestation is fully compatible with REAP. REAP participants are subject to a maximum land area of 10ha for individual farmers and 30ha for partnerships of three farm holdings. The average REAP area under management per participant is 8.4ha. It is important to note that REAP is not a whole-of-farm project and that afforestation opportunities continue to exist for REAP participants on parcels that have not been selected for the project.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-24a.1288.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022400086#WRFF04300"><p>The Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities. As part of '<i>Our Rural Future'</i><b><i>,</i></b>the Government is committed to ensuring that the LIS is funded into the future. This reflects the important contribution which the scheme makes to connectivity in rural Ireland. </p><p>The allocation of funding under the Local Improvement Scheme in 2020 was based on the physical area of each county, with a maximum and minimum ceiling applied.  In 2020 Cork received the maximum allocation of &euro;900,000 and drew down a total of &euro;896,693. </p><p>The 2021 Scheme was launched in May with funding of &euro;10.5 million and each county was provided with an additional &euro;20,000 relative to their 2020 allocation.  On this basis, Cork was allocated &euro;920,000. This again represented the maximum level of funding available to any individual county.  </p><p>I was pleased to source additional funding during the year and allocated a further round of funding of &euro;10.5 million to bring the total nationally under the scheme for 2021 to &euro;21 million. This additional funding was allocated based on each local authority's view as to their capacity to deliver improvement works by year-end. Cork County Council submitted a request for funding of &euro;700,000 under this second tranche.  The second round of funding was over subscribed and consequently  each county was allocated just over 70% of the amount sought.</p><p>Cork County Council was awarded &euro;492,738 under this second round, bringing the total allocation for 2021 in Cork to &euro;1,412,738. The total funding drawn down by Cork in 2021 was &euro;1,410,172, which included a small amount of their allocation that was not utilised in 2021 but which has been claimed and is being carried over into 2022.  Claims for recoupment are based on a county and not municipal district basis.</p><p>Finally, I was also pleased, as part of Budget 2022, to announce an increase in the base funding for LIS from &euro;10.5 million in 2021 to &euro;11 million this year. I expect to launch this year's scheme in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, Galway County Council is the body responsible for development of stage three of the Caladh M&oacute;r pier development.  Users of the pier, including a number of State subsidised ferry operators, have highlighted issues with capacity within the harbour, as well as with currents around the mouth of the harbour.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and from Galway County Council met with the local committee from Inis Me&aacute;in on Friday 18th February to discuss the progress to date and to update them on the next steps of this development. Galway County Council provided a clear step by step guide of how this development will progress, along with estimated timelines for the current stage of the project. This involves a further marine survey that will feed into the development of a model simulation of the harbour by the National Marine College of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The other issues raised by the Deputy were also discussed at the meeting.  It was agreed to convene a further meeting with the group in a number of months in order to update them on the progress of the project.</p></reply>
