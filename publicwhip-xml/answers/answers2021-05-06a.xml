The first phase of SBASC closed for applications through the local authorities on 21 April 2021.  Phase 1 of the scheme is currently being reviewed and details of Phase 2 are due to be announced in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  I want to assure you, that I and my Government colleagues are keeping all the current business support schemes under review.</p></reply>

The Regulations transpose the EU requirements of Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information. The Directive is underpinned by non-binding guidelines for disclosure prepared by the EU Commission.</p><p>Failure to comply with the obligation to disclose information under the Regulations is an offence in Irish law. The maximum penalty on conviction is a fine of up to &euro; 5,000 and/ or a term of imprisonment of no more than 6 months. Enforcement is a matter for the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p><p>As one of the actions under the European Green Deal, to enhance further the disclosure by companies on climate and environmental data, the EU Commission initiated a review of the Directive 2014/95/EU. A proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive was published on 21 April 2021. The Deputy can find further detail on the EU Commission proposal on the Commission&rsquo;s website. </p><p>The proposal will revise the existing Directive and includes in scope all large companies and listed SMEs except microenterprises. It is also proposed that EFRAG, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, will be responsible for developing new standards for EU sustainability reporting. </p><p>I understand it is anticipated that EU Council negotiations at working party level will commence in the near future. The final proposal will depend on EU Parliament and Council agreement and I understand that this is hoped for in the first half of 2022. </p></reply>

Membership of the CLRG, a statutory body, is representative of a broad range of stakeholder experts, making it uniquely well positioned to advise on company law. The CLRG completed its work within an accelerated timeframe reporting back to the T&aacute;naiste and I in October 2020.  The report set out its recommendation for a proposed new process for the rescue of small companies, distinct from the existing examinership legislation. Since then my Department has been developing a General Scheme of Bill and which was also informed by a public consultation in February.</p>  <p>  The Companies (Amendment) Bill providing for a dedicated rescue process for small companies is included in the priority summer legislative programme. Given the urgency of the proposed legislation to assist viable companies remain in business, I will bring the General Scheme of Bill to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  In so far as personal insolvency is concerned, the Programme for Government committed to introduce the necessary reforms to our personal insolvency legislation and ensure that sufficient supports are in place for mortgage holders with repayment difficulties.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice has brought forward the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill 2020 which seeks to make it easier for insolvent persons, including those in financial difficulties arising from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to avail of the Personal Insolvency Act effectively. The Bill has completed all stages in the Seanad and is currently awaiting Second Stage in the Dail.</p>  <p>  A further Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill is included in the Government&rsquo;s summer legislation programme. That is a larger Bill to address comprehensively the recommendations arising from the statutory review of the Personal Insolvency Acts which is currently being carried out by my colleague the Minister for Justice. Among the issues raised by submissions to the review are proposals to simplify and streamline the overall personal insolvency process. The report of the review is expected to be completed this summer, and work will then begin on the General Scheme of that Bill, with a view to submitting proposals to Government before the end of the year as set out in the Justice Plan 2021.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-06a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021050600070#WRB00400"><p>LEO Dublin City like many of the Local Enterprise Offices experienced an unprecedented increase in activity and engagement with clients and stakeholders across 2020 and this has continued into the current year. Last year, for example, the Local Enterprise Offices network approved 12,946 Trading Online Vouchers to assist businesses get online to trade or improve their existing online offering.  This represented a 950% increase on 2019 activity and proved to be a vital resource for many businesses helping to reach their customers. The Dublin City Local Enterprise Office received almost 1,100 applications for the TOV scheme in 2020, a 9-fold increase on the number of vouchers approved the previous year.</p>  <p>  In addition to the demands associated with the Trading Online Voucher Scheme, the Local Enterprise Offices received almost 15,000 application for the Business Continuity Voucher and provided significant training and mentoring to small businesses in 2020 to help them navigate the particularly difficult trading environment created by COVID-19 and Brexit.  The Local Enterprise Offices trained over 77,000 entrepreneurs and business representatives, more than double the 37,000 from the year previous.  Furthermore, the LEOs completed 16,231 business mentoring assignments up from 10,756 in 2019. This significant increase in activity has inevitably led to an increased administrative burden on Local Enterprise Office staff across the entire network over the past year and this demand for services has continued into 2021. </p>  <p>  In 2020, My Department secured an additional &euro;1.3m to support the Local Enterprise Office staff across the network to deliver their additional workload through and beyond the COVID-19 Crisis. This additional funding provided for an increase in headcount across the network of 63 additional temporary staff for the period 1st September to 31st December 2020.  I am pleased to advise that a further &euro;1.3m was secured for 2021 to retain those staff for a further 6 months.  An extension of this arrangement is now being considered subject to ongoing budgetary pressures.  </p>  <p>  This additional funding has provided 4 additional staff members for LEO Dublin City, of whom three are specifically assigned to the administration of the Trading Online Voucher scheme.  I understand that Dublin City is still experiencing a backlog in processing Trading Online Voucher applications, but I am assured that this matter is being addressed appropriately and that Dublin City Local Enterprise Office is taking all appropriate steps to reduce the timelines to a more acceptable level.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-06a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021050600070#WRB00700"><p>In 1981, the European Commission took infringement proceedings against a Buy Irish campaign then in operation. In its subsequent judgment (<i>Commission v Ireland</i>, case C-249/81), the European Court of Justice held that the campaign was a reflection of the Irish Government&rsquo;s intention to substitute domestic products for imported products on the Irish market and thereby to check the flow of imports from other Member States. Accordingly, under Single Market rules, Ireland cannot advocate a specific &lsquo;Guaranteed Irish&rsquo; or &lsquo;Buy Irish&rsquo; campaign, but we can however encourage our citizens to buy local.</p><p>Buying locally sustains local economies and the growth of jobs and vibrant communities throughout Ireland, regardless of the source of those goods.</p><p>In November 2020, I launched the #LookForLocal campaign, the aim of this national, local and digital campaign was to support local economies and SMEs by encouraging consumers to &lsquo;look for local&rsquo; when buying goods and services, on-line or off-line, especially in the run-up to Christmas 2020.</p><p>The &lsquo;Look for Local&rsquo; campaign undertaken by the Local Enterprise Offices was run in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities and drove consumer and SME traffic to website listings on Local Enterprise Office websites. This resulted in over 4,500 local companies listing on the &quot;Look for Local&quot; campaign webpages, covering every business sector and local authority area. The results of a customer survey undertaken during this period showed that Irish consumers were 80% more likely to shop local through online portals.</p><p>Also, in 2020, The Design and Crafts Council Ireland (DCCI) launched the &lsquo;Made Local&rsquo; campaign aimed at sustaining Ireland&rsquo;s design and craft sector. It celebrated Irish creativity and aimed to inspire consumers, craftspeople, retailers and media to continue to contribute to their local economies.  The &lsquo;Made Local&rsquo; campaign ran throughout the summer with 100 retailers involved in the campaign, supporting the work of DCCI&rsquo;s 3,000 registered clients.</p><p>Following on from the success of these campaigns, consideration is being given to running similar local promotional campaigns to showcase the goods and services available in our localities and to encourage people to continue to support their local economies throughout this recovery period and beyond as we look to regenerate our towns and villages nationwide.</p></reply>

The initiative relies on the participation of those researchers, developers and manufacturers who hold such intellectual property to voluntarily suspend their patent rights.  I am not aware that any of the leading pharmaceutical companies have endorsed the initiative, although several have independently undertaken licensing agreements regarding vaccines outside of the initiative.  I understand that there has been limited engagement by WHO Member States with the initiative to date, which as I said primarily focusses on researchers, developers and manufacturers.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently championed collaborative responses to the pandemic, with a focus on ensuring that the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are served by our collective effort. The sharing of technology on vaccines, diagnostics, and treatment, is part of a broader suite of responses by Ireland to COVID-19. Ireland has shown support for sharing COVID-19 related knowledge and research outputs through many fora including, inter alia, the National Open Research Forum, Non-exclusive Royalty Free licenses through Knowledge Transfer Ireland, and SFI&rsquo;s alignment with Plan S, an initiative to ensure publicly funded research is openly available, immediately, without embargo for the betterment of societal needs.</p>  <p>  Ireland as part of Team Europe has pointed to the COVAX facility as the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p>  <p>  As part of our response, the Government, via Irish Aid has channeled &euro;5 million to direct supports to COVID-19 vaccination, including through the COVAX mechanism, which has to date delivered over 49 million vaccines already to 121 participant countries.</p></reply>

In exercising that competence at the WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland through a variety of Committees and Working Parties/Groups, including on intellectual property.</p>  <p>  The EU position is that the challenges raised by the proponents of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) waiver can be addressed through the existing flexibilities within the WTO TRIPS Agreement which allows governments to grant compulsory licences without the permission of the patent holder. The EU Commission also points out that the IP system incentivises and enables the stakeholders to share their innovations, to exchange knowledge and data, and to license.  </p>  <p>  The EU position is that manufacturing capacity, access to raw materials and distribution networks are the main obstacles that need to be overcome in the supply of vaccines and that increasing manufacturing capacity may be better attained through voluntary licensing arrangements by disseminating the technology and know-how of those who developed the vaccines.  The EU Commission has set up a Task Force for Industrial Scale-up of COVID-19 vaccine production which aims to support the ramp-up of production capacity and address supply chain bottlenecks.</p>  <p>  The EU is committed and open to trying to reach agreement with all members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on how to achieve the shared goal of providing timely and secure access to safe and affordable vaccines and medicines for all through the multilateral rules-based trading system.  Discussions are continuing at the WTO, including in relation to how the TRIPS Agreement can support fast and effective vaccine availability. Ireland is represented in those discussions by the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global supply and access to COVID-19 vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p></reply>

However, Enterprise Ireland does not provide such training to businesses on becoming authorised consignees.</p>  <p>  As this is very much a freight, transport and logistics sectoral issue, there are various representative associations providing services to and for their memberships and running training programmes covering all aspects of customs procedures including the role of the authorised consignee. </p>  <p>  The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) Skillnet is also currently developing a programme to support businesses in becoming an authorised consignee, with the programme expected to be available by mid Q3 2021. The programme is focused on the practical aspects of operating as an authorised consignee and aimed at companies of all sizes in the transport and logistics sectors. CILT Skillnet intends to liaise with Revenue to ensure that the content meets Revenue standards and requirements as they relate to acting as an authorised consignee. The &lsquo;Authorised Consignee&rsquo; programme will complement the ongoing work of CILT Skillnet in providing programmes to aid Irish Companies with post-Brexit trading.</p></reply>

Last year, Ireland signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the Clean Energy for EU Islands Initiative, recognising the important role islands can play in realising the objectives of the European Green Deal. It sets out the objective to establish a long-term framework for cooperation to advance the energy transition for islands. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is the main government support to help deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s 70% renewable electricity target by 2030. The scheme has a number of community features designed to ensure community participation. Of particular interest to island communities are the provisions of the Community Benefit Fund and the Community-led category. The former provides for all RESS projects, including offshore projects, to share project revenues with local communities for sustainable purposes and the latter provides a route to market for community-led projects. To better support communities in bringing forward community-led projects, an enabling framework is currently under development by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, and to this end I have allocated a &euro;3 million capital supports budget this year.</p></reply>

The NBP contract provides that the maximum cost to the State of delivering the NBP network over the 25 year period of the contract is &euro;2.7bn and this subsidy includes the cost of bringing fibre connectivity to our offshore islands.  </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the homenetwork. As of 29 April, 11 BCP sites on islands have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and by the Department of Education for schools. Further details can be found at .</p><p>My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband as part of the BCP initiative, including the islands within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP.

Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established at that time to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

In 2020, SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes supported the upgrading of over 17,600 homes. This included over 3,200 homes upgraded to BER rating of B2 or better. The number of retrofits last year were unfortunately, negatively impacted by COVID-19 related restrictions. We need to ramp up to at least 56,000 B2 retrofits per year by 2024.   The development of the national retrofit programme to achieve these targets is well underway. Some &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes. This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes. This allocation has facilitated the expansion and improvement of existing SEAI grant schemes and the introduction of new initiatives. The funding has already supported calls for projects under the new National Retrofit (One-Stop-Shop Development) scheme and the Community Energy Grant Scheme as well as a &euro;47 million increase in funding for energy poverty schemes. Further SEAI administered retrofit initiatives will be launched in the coming months. The programme will be implemented through a range of schemes and initiatives, which will be developed and evolve over time, and therefore a county by county annual schedule for the next nine years has not been prepared.</p></reply>

This rehabilitation will take place over a period of 5 years. All of the lands being rehabilitated are operated under Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licences granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. The scheme will build on, and complement, the measures required under Integrated Pollution Control licences. This funding will support a just transition by maintaining jobs in the Midlands, as well as laying the foundation for more substantial and sustainable job creation into the future. The enhanced rehabilitation scheme will protect the storage of 100 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, deliver benefits in terms of increasing biodiversity, supporting bog amenity and eco-system services, as well as improved water quality and water attenuation relating to flood risk management to the benefit communities locally and nationally. Through the implementation of the scheme, it is also estimated that over the period to 2050, 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions will be avoided (including an amount of future carbon sequestration), in comparison to a standard rehabilitation scenario.</p><p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service will act as the scheme regulator. Bord na M&oacute;na must develop detailed work programmes for each bog based on its specific needs and site characteristics, including a hydrological assessment. These will ensure that the works not only optimise the benefits to the former peatlands but also mitigate negative impacts on the local communities. Consultation also forms a key element of the roll out of the Scheme and Bord na M&oacute;na are consulting with stakeholders and landowners that may be impacted. Bord Na Mona has in place, and has committed to maintain, a care and maintenance team who will be responsible, among other things for boundary management on the Bord na M&oacute;na land banks. Bord Na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s obligations as a property owner are not affected by the provision of this funding.</p></reply>

These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  The ESD allows Member States to meet their targets using surplus emissions credits from earlier years or through purchasing credits from other Member States or on international markets. Ireland has already met its emissions targets from 2013 to 2018. However, the latest greenhouse gas emissions report, published by the Environmental Protection Agency in January 2021, indicates that Ireland will cumulatively exceed the 2019 and 2020 annual targets by approximately 11 to 12Mt. Ireland will, therefore, need to purchase additional allowances to meet the projected shortfall. </p>  <p>  Any requirement to use already purchased or additional credits for compliance under the ESD will be undertaken in accordance with all relevant regulations as set out by the European Union, the European Commission, the United Nations and all relevant international agreements.</p></reply>

The Bill establishes a system of carbon budgeting with three 5-year economy-wide budgets included in each carbon budget programme. Each carbon budget represents the total amount of greenhouse gases that may be emitted in the State during each 5 year period, measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The first carbon budget programme will comprise carbon budgets for the following periods: 2021 to 2025; 2026 to 2030; and 2031 to 2035.</p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the Climate Change Advisory Council will propose a programme of three successive 5-year carbon budgets to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. The Minister will, after consideration and consultation, present the budgets to the Government. Once approved by Government, the Minister will propose a motion in both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval of the carbon budget. The carbon budget shall have effect on and from the date on which a motion approving the carbon budget has been passed by both Houses. These budgets have not been set as yet.</p>  <p>  After the carbon budget has been approved, the Minister will prepare sectoral emissions ceilings for each relevant sector in consultation with other Ministers. These sectoral emissions ceilings must also be approved by the Government.  </p>  <p>  The sectors of the economy to which each sectoral emissions ceiling will apply will be determined by the Government. The process will build on the approach established for the 2019 Climate Action Plan, whereby actions and measures will be developed for each sector on the basis of technical and scientific analysis, but also now taking account of the detailed set of principles set out in the Bill in order to determine what the appropriate range of contribution is for each sector. These ceilings will be set at sectoral level and not on individual companies. </p>  <p>  It is noted that approximately 70% of Ireland's enterprise sector greenhouse gas emissions are also subject to a separate target in the form of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The EU ETS sets a price for carbon emissions, thereby making low emissions alternatives more attractive to enterprise. The ETS will function in a complementary manner to the forthcoming carbon budgets and sectoral ceilings.</p></reply>

The proposed support mechanism was outlined in a public consultation launched in January (now closed) and the submissions received are currently being reviewed. While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all micro-generators in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive.  </p><p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published an updated Roadmap for the Clean Energy Package&rsquo;s Electricity and Renewables Directives in February, which provides for a public consultation on the regulatory framework for prosumer development later this year.

For this reason, aviation policy has, for decades, placed a priority on international connectivity. The sector is currently experiencing its most challenging crisis in its history. Many analysts are predicting that it will take several years for the sector to return to 2019 levels of activity. Traffic in 2020 was down around 80% on 2019, and revenue has fallen away dramatically as COVID-19 related restrictions on international travel continue to heavily constrain passenger traffic. </p>  <p>  A sub-group of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, specifically tasked with developing an Aviation Restart Plan, submitted a report dated 14 April with proposals that they believe will best provide for the restart and recovery of the aviation sector in Ireland. This report and its proposals are under review by the Department of Transport, in consultation with all relevant Government Departments. Additional clarity has been sought by the Department of Transport on operational matters.</p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, an aviation sub-group chaired by Minister of State Naughton, has also been charged with looking at the needs of the aviation sector in Ireland in the context of the impact of COVID-19. This sub-group is attended by delegations from labour and employer representative bodies, and is chaired by myself.</p>  <p>  We are not yet positioned to restart aviation but are preparing the ground for when we can. Until then, Government will continue to provide support to the aviation industry through a range of measures - most notably the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, the objective of which is to maintain the link between the employer and employee, insofar as is possible. Over &euro;200 million has already been made available in COVID-19 business supports for Irish airlines and airports.  </p>  <p>  We look forward to progressing our engagement with the aviation sector in Ireland and to working together to get international travel back on a strong footing when circumstances allow.</p></reply>

For this reason the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement schemes. In this context 12 regional and local road improvement projects were identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP and the construction of a Distributor Road to the south of Athy connecting to the N78 is one of those schemes. </p>  <p>  Under the Public Spending Code and the terms and conditions applying to regional and local road grants, capital projects are subject to review and approval at a number of stages.

Though a protracted recovery is likely, the progress of our national vaccination programme and those of our European and other international partners will be key to recovery. My Department is monitoring the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Irish aviation sector on an ongoing basis, in consultation with all key stakeholders and relevant Government Departments. Though we are not yet positioned to restart aviation, we are preparing the ground for when we can. Until then, Government will continue to provide support to the aviation sector.

However, this can only be accomplished at a time that is safe to do so, and with public health advice fully considered.</p>  <p>  The Government therefore welcomes the recent restart and recovery report produced by the aviation industry participants of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum (NCADF). The report contains many recommendations for consideration across Government and requires engagement across all relevant Government Departments and consultation with public health authorities, which is now underway.

Neither the NTA nor the Minister are bound by any advice provided. To ensure that the Committee can provide an informed view on relevant policy and regulatory matters, its composition is prescribed by legislation to ensure that it represents a broad range of interests, and insofar as is practicable, ensures an equitable gender balance between men and women, and equitable representation from both urban and rural areas. </p><p>Drivers are an important part of the Committee&rsquo;s membership, and four positions on the Committee are reserved for members who can represent driver interests. All four of these positions are filled by licenced SPSV drivers from across the country and I am satisfied that this ensures the Committee&rsquo;s advice is informed by the perspective of drivers. The Committee also features dispatch operators, representatives of disabled passengers and older passengers, and members from the tourist industry, local government and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am of the view that one of the strengths of the Committee is this broad and diverse representation. The perspective of passengers is of particular importance in considering SPSV policy issues.</p><p>As mentioned, the role of the Advisory Committee is to provide advice to the Minister and the NTA on matters relating to the small public service vehicle sector. It is not a lobby group.  As such, the agenda of this forum is not dictated solely by the concerns of driver representatives and meetings of the Advisory Committee do not replace the normal interactions that occur between taxi driver representative groups and the industry&rsquo;s statutory regulator, the NTA. As Minister for Transport, I will continue to meet from time to time with representative groups as I would meet with any lobby group or interest group, and officials in my Department will continue to listen to their perspective. However, the focus of my engagement will continue to be the Advisory Committee given its statutory role. I have met with the Committee twice as Minister for Transport and I would hope to meet with the Committee again at least one more time this year.</p><p>Although the legislation prescribes the composition of the Advisory Committee, it does not provide for a specific method for filling vacancies on the Committee and, accordingly, the approach taken over the years has varied. The unpaid nature of positions on the Committee has posed a challenge in recruiting suitable candidates through open competition. </p><p>Last September I met with representatives of four taxi representative groups and invited them to put forward candidates to fill driver vacancies on the Committee. These groups, after lengthy consideration, advised the NTA in March that they would not take up these positions. As a result, officials in my Department and the NTA engaged with stakeholder groups to identify suitable candidates for the remaining vacancies with reference to the gender and regional balance requirements of the legislation. In appointing these candidates, I left open one vacancy on the Committee for the time being. I have done so because, although I respect the decision of the four taxi representative groups not to participate in the Committee, I nevertheless hope that they reconsider their position in time.</p><p>The current membership of the Committee is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Name</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cornelius O&rsquo;Donohoe (Chairperson) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fiona Brady</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ann Campbell</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Joan Carthy (Irish Wheelchair Association)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>James Cawley</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shajedul Chowdhury</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Francis Doheny</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Noel Ebbs</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kevin Finn</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Peter Fleming  (Beaufort Centre)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mary Henchy (Local Authorities)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>John Murphy</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Supt Thomas Murphy  (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>James O&rsquo;Brien</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Martin Plummer</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Michelle Reid</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Al Ryan</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Driving tests will also gradually recommence for those who are eligible to take the test, with those waiting longest being contacted first.  First invitations will be issued later this month.</p>  <p>  The RSA and the Department plan to reduce the waiting times and backlog of those waiting for driving tests as quickly as possible. In addition to recently recruiting 40 temporary testers, the RSA is looking to increase the number of tests to 7 per tester per day as well as extending operating hours when restrictions are lifted. </p>  <p>  Under Level 5 Restrictions, no Essential Driving Training (EDT) sessions were permitted.  However, EDT will now recommence for essential workers  and for those who had not completed their EDT before the restrictions came into place.  EDT will also commence for motorcyclists.</p>  <p>  The Driver Theory Test is considered a non-essential service and remains closed. Because the service was closed for long periods of time over the last year, a large backlog of customers has built up. We recognise that it will take time to meet this demand and restore pre-COVID-19 waiting times when the service does reopen. </p>  <p>  In response to this, the RSA will introduce an increase in capacity within the service when it is allowed to re-open.  This additional capacity will see the number of tests increase from an average pre Covid19 output of 15,000 tests per month to 50,000 per month when the service resumes. This will help significantly to tackle the backlog of customers waiting for a driver theory test and shorten waiting times.</p>  <p>  A pilot online driver theory test is underway for trucks and buses. This will be extended to car drivers later this month, initially with 3,200 tests being available per month. Online services will be made more widely available towards the end of 2021.</p></reply>

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.</p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. The NTA, following consultation with operators, has recently finalised a review of the scheme and as a result some changes to services are expected to be implemented later this month.</p>  <p>  As is the case in many other sectors of the economy, despite these Government supports, Covid-19 has resulted in significant financial pressures for public transport operators.  As you will be aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway business operates on a commercial basis in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market.  Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020.  This was a commercial decision by the company.  The decision affects four routes:  the Dublin/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020): and services on the Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Galway routes.  </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement public service obligation (PSO) service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public.

It was intended that the capability would be introduced on a phased basis once funds were available and within safety and operational parameters. Once the equipment was installed, a training programme for all CHC crew was developed by the operator. For a variety of reasons, this programme has been interrupted and delayed, most recently owing to Covid restrictions. Once operational over the coming months, it will be a significant enhancement to the SAR service.</p></reply>

The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Strategic Grant Programme are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF).

Following consideration of this submission by the Department, Cork County Council has been advised that further work is required on the project appraisal.  The application for funding will be further considered once a revised appraisal is received. As part of the project funding appraisal form local authorities are required to outline proposed sources of funding for a scheme. In the case of the Adrigole scheme Cork County Council has indicated that it is seeking 100% funding from my Department.  Possible alternative sources of funding would be for the Council to explore but as regards the regional and local roads grant programme operated by my Department, there is no funding available under an EU funding programme at present.</p></reply>

Under that Scheme, funding can be provided to local authorities for the construction and improvement of non-public roads (that is roads not taken in charge by local authorities) which meet the criteria set out in the Act. A contribution from the beneficiaries is required in all cases. </p>  <p>  Up to 2012 my Department did provide ring-fenced funding for this scheme. However, due to the major cutbacks in roads funding arising from the post 2008 financial crisis, it was necessary for the Department to stop providing dedicated funding for LIS in 2012 and there was no funding for LIS in that year. </p>  <p>  After that from 2013 to 2017, while there was no separate allocation for the Local Improvement Scheme, local authorities could use a proportion of their Discretionary grant for the Local Improvement Scheme if they chose to do so. The reason this approach was taken was that it was considered that Councils were best placed to decide whether to concentrate the limited grant funding available on public roads or to operate a local improvement scheme for non public roads.</p>  <p>  In September 2017, my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development reintroduced dedicated funding for the LIS and is continuing to fund the scheme. In light of the significant funding being put into LIS by the Department of Rural and Community Development and the need to direct resources into maintaining and renewing public roads, it was decided that the option of allocating a proportion of my Department's Discretionary grant to LIS would no longer apply from 2018. This remains the position. </p>  <p>  While the National Development Plan 2018-2027 provides for a gradual increase in funding for regional and local roads, investment is not yet at the level needed to ensure that the public road network is being maintained adequately. For this reason, I consider that I need to continue to concentrate funding on the maintenance and renewal of the public regional and local road network together with some targeted investment in road improvement projects.  </p>  <p>  The funding for the LIS will continue to be available from the Department of Rural and Community Development in 2021.</p></reply>

This Act sets out the roles and responsibilities of a number of bodies.</p>  <p>  Section 51 places the initial responsibility for removing a wreck on the owner of the vessel. However, if the appropriate authority, in this case Cork County Council, considers the wreck is or is likely to become an obstruction or danger to navigation or a threat of harm to the marine environment, or to related interests, which includes the health of the public, it shall proceed to raise and remove the wreck or otherwise render it harmless.</p>  <p>  Section 40 of the Act provides that the Minister for Transport has the &ldquo;general superintendence&rdquo; of matters relating to wrecked or stranded vessels. However, further provisions outline the responsibilities from an operational perspective for other bodies. </p>  <p>  Separate provisions apply regarding ownership, sale and proceeds for wrecks and a Receiver of Wrecks appointed under the Act deals with these matters.</p>  <p>  As the appropriate authority under the Act, Cork County Council has taken the lead in dealing with the case in question and has taken a number of steps to date in their duties under the Act. </p>  <p>  While the Act does allow for the removal of a wreck, it does not contain provisions in relation to the costs associated with the removal of a wreck where the sale of that wreck is not possible, and the owners of the vessel cannot be located. It is understood that no evidence of ownership or insurance has come to light yet in the case referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Act provides for an offence for a person to board or attempt to board any wrecked or stranded vessel without permission and also provides for an offence if a person interferes with a wreck in any way.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been represented by the Coast Guard at a number of inter-agency meetings on the matter. Furthermore, on foot of a recommendation in a report published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) on the grounding of the wreck concerned, my Department has established a working group to explore the risks and potential costs to the State presented by derelict ships entering Irish territorial waters and coming ashore in Ireland and make proposals for means to identify, monitor, track and interdict derelict ships before they endanger other ships and seafarers in the vicinity.</p>  <p>  My Department is available to attend operational inter-agency meetings on this issue. Furthermore, in light of the recent fire at the site of the wreck concerned, I have asked my officials to engage directly with Cork County Council as the appropriate authority, with a view to assessing appropriate next steps.</p></reply>

It is fair to say that that taxpayers' interests would not have been best served by such an extension in circumstances where it is likely that we will all be staying at home and hopefully holidaying in Ireland. It may be more appropriate to take stock again after a further period and assess then if the position needs to be reconsidered.</p>  <p>  While in operation, the purpose of the Stay and Spend scheme was to provide indirect support to service providers. This included, amongst others, hotels, guest houses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, caravan and camping parks and self-catering properties registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  As regards the question raised by the Deputy, annual fees payable by owners of mobile homes would not have fallen within the ambit of qualifying expenditure. </p>  <p>  With regard to the possibility of other tax reliefs on fees payable by owners of mobile homes to service providers, I do not believe it would be equitable to introduce such a relief. </p>  <p>  More generally also, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer; tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, changes to measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Insurance Reform sets out 66 actions across several policy areas, with 95 per cent due to be completed by the end of 2021. Progress continues to be made across many areas, and the adoption of the Personal Injuries Guidelines is a key milestone in this regard.  The wide-ranging reforms under the Action Plan for Insurance Reform should help improve both the cost and availability of all types of cover, including property insurance.</p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is primarily focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. The Government is investing almost &euro;1 billion in flood relief measures over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018-2027 with an expectation that insurers will provide cover where this has occurred. This approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Office of Public Works (OPW) and industry representatives Insurance Ireland. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should, in turn, provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in these areas.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that as Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal and policy framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  That being said, I am conscious of the challenges that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses. I acknowledge that while there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2020, some householders are still experiencing difficulties. This is particularly the case for households in areas with demountable flood defences. My officials are engaging with both Insurance Ireland, the OPW and other stakeholders regarding flood defence schemes and how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will also continue to engage on all aspects of insurance reform, including flood cover, and that every effort is being made to encourage a responsive approach from the industry.</p></reply>

Payments made to employees through the scheme are liable to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC). The scheme was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.</p>  <p>  On 15 January 2021, Revenue made a Preliminary End of Year Statement for 2020 available to all PAYE taxpayers through the online myAccount facility, including those who received TWSS payments and Pandemic Unemployment Payments (PUP) from the Department of Social Protection. The statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of their tax position for the year before any additional incomes are declared or additional credits or reliefs are claimed.</p>  <p>  To establish their final tax position for 2020, PAYE taxpayers should complete an income tax return, claiming any additional credits or reliefs due, for example health expenses. Once the income tax return is completed, a Statement of Liability will issue to the taxpayer(s) setting out the final position for the year. Any outstanding tax liability remaining after all credits and reliefs have been allocated can be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing tax credits. The quickest and easiest way to submit the income tax return is through Revenue&rsquo;s myAccount service. Further information regarding the end of year process can be found at: www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/end-of-year-process/income-tax-return.aspx, which may be of assistance to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In jointly assessed situations where one spouse is self-employed, any review of liabilities arising from TWSS are determined when the self-assessed spouse submits his/her income tax return for 2020. This return is due by 31 October 2021 (with an extension to 17 November 2021 provided for taxpayers who file and pay electronically). Any balances due in such cases are generally settled by direct payment at that point. However, the self-assessed spouse may qualify for the Debt Warehousing Scheme, which provides the option to defer the payment of COVID-19 related tax debts, including any tax and USC liabilities arising from TWSS payments to the other spouse. Further information on the Debt Warehousing Scheme is available at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/documents/debt-warehousing-reduced-interest-measures.pdf.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that some employers have agreed to pay, on behalf of its employees, underpayments of tax and USC for 2020 that have arisen due to the non-taxation in real-time of TWSS payments. Revenue has facilitated this arrangement by disapplying the benefit in kind rules, in respect of such payments, on an administrative basis. Further details are available at: www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/twss/employers/index.aspx, which may be of interest to the Deputy. This facility applies also to employers who wish to settle the TWSS related debts of an employee who is jointly assessed and his/her spouse is subject to self-assessment.</p>  <p>  However, Revenue has previously stated that for certain employees where their employer paid net weekly earnings of between &euro;586 and &euro;960 pre-COVID, the full amount of the subsidy due to such employees may not have been paid through the payroll process during the period the TWSS was in operation. The process of identifying those employees who qualify for an additional subsidy is currently in progress. Revenue intends to offset any additional amount against an individual&rsquo;s outstanding income tax/Universal Social Charge (USC) due for 2020, or by way of direct refund if the person has no 2020 arrears. It is expected that this process will be implemented by the middle of this year when all the relevant data from employers has been reconciled and the required IT systems developments have been completed.</p></reply>

The Code states that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation, it makes full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer.  Where a regulated entity intends to introduce new charges or increase any existing charges, under provision 6.18 of the Code, it must give notice to affected consumers of the introduction of any new charges or of increases in charges, specifying the old and new charge, at least 30 days prior to the charge taking effect.  The regulated entity&rsquo;s &lsquo;terms of business&rsquo; document as required by the Code must include a general statement of the charges imposed directly by the regulated entity. Prior to providing a product or service to a consumer, a regulated entity must provide the consumer, on paper or another durable medium, with a breakdown of all charges which will be passed on to the consumer. A regulated entity must display in its public offices a schedule of their fees and charges, and this schedule must also be placed on its website.</p><p>The EU (Payment Accounts) Regulations 2016, transposing the Payment Accounts Directive, introduced new rules in relation to transparency and comparability of fees connected to payment accounts. These include a requirement to give consumers a fee information document before they open an account as well as a requirement to give consumers, free of charge and at least once a year, a statement of fees for the services linked to the consumer&rsquo;s payment account.</p><p>I would encourage all bank customers, particularly those adversely affected by changes in bank charges, to shop around and compare the fees and benefits of the different current accounts available.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website provides useful information to assist customers to compare and switch accounts. My Department has also run two media campaigns as part of a range of competition measures agreed with the European Commission to raise awareness and promote customer switching in the retail financial product area and the campaign website <i>www.switchyourbank.ie</i>provides straightforward practical information and support on switching and I would strongly encourage people to visit it. The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on the Switching of Payment Accounts with Payment Service Providers sets out protections for consumers who switch payment accounts.</p><p>The Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group, chaired by my Department, published its Report on supplementary pensions in November 2020. This provides a number of recommendations and conclusions to help advance the aim of simplifying and harmonising the supplementary pension landscape in Ireland. It seeks to improve regulatory oversight and reduce costs which in turn should lead to better retirement outcomes for pension savers. The complexity of pension products, which currently requires a high level of intermediation between the consumer and supplementary pension providers, drives up costs for some consumers through payments of fees and commissions for intermediation and advice services. Reducing the number of schemes and rationalising pension products will help diminish such complexity, enhance market competitiveness, drive product efficiencies and in turn should lead to better retirement outcomes for pension savers. The Group is actively working on implementing a number of those recommendations with a view to addressing some of those highlighted issues.</p><p>Section 92 of the Pensions Act 1990 provides for the approval process for PRSAs. The Pensions Authority and Revenue are jointly responsible for approving PRSA products. Potential new PRSA product providers must meet with the Authority prior to submitting an application for PRSA product approval. The Pensions Authority supervises the activities of PRSA providers in relation to their approved products and monitors compliance with PRSA legislation. The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the prudential supervision of PRSA providers and the supervision of the sales process of approved PRSA products. The Pensions Authority publishes on its website a list of all PRSA providers, the products offered by each provider, and the charges (contribution and fund) related to each PRSA product.</p><p>Separately, at the European level, my Department is supportive of the Pan-European Personal Pension Product regulation which will introduce standardisation and harmonisation of key information on costs and fees on such products across the Union. Work on this has commenced and is ongoing in my department.</p></reply>

However, in preparation for the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU, Revenue did engage extensively and directly over a 2 year period with businesses, customs agents,  representative organisations as well as individual truck drivers to help them navigate the challenges in terms of getting familiar with and completing customs formalities. This level of support ranged from briefing seminars, involving physical attendance when that was possible, webinars, online guidance  and targeted, sector-specific advice and the operation of a 24/7 Customs Operations Helpline.</p><p>  I am further advised that Revenue continues to work with trade and business, on both a collective and individual basis, to assist them in addressing the challenges and issues arising from the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. Customs and other State agency officials work on a 24/7 basis at Dublin and Rosslare ports and in Dublin Airport, and will work with businesses to resolve issues as quickly as possible.</p><p>  There are a range of Government supports available, including training and grants, to help business deal with these changes resulting from the UKs departure from the EU. More information is available on the, &lsquo;Government Brexit Advisory, Financial and Upskilling Supports&rsquo; page of the Gov.ie website.  With regard to becoming an authorised consignee, I am advised that the specific steps required are clearly outlined on the Revenue website . Where an economic operator has specific questions as to their application or indeed the legal aspects of the role of Authorised Consignee they may contact the Transit Unit at centraltransitofficenenagh@revenue.ie. Where a business has a specific IT related question they may contact E-Customs at ecustoms@revenue.ie.</p></reply>

These include procurement websites, policy information, and relevant Departmental Circulars, guidance documents, information notes, template documentation, helpdesk services, framework agreements and procurement support services.  There are an estimated 8,000 public bodies who can make use of OGP services, across central and local government, and in the health and education sectors.  Some of these bodies have have significant procurement expertise themselves, whereas others have limited procurement knowledge and experience.  This breadth requires the OGP to have delivery strategies that target supports accordingly.  Therefore, as part of its commitment to continuous improvement and providing an excellent customer experience, the OGP regularly engages with its client base to gauge their awareness of and satisfaction with its service provision, and to identify areas for improvement.  In addition to the day-to-day feedback during and after client engagements, the OGP also undertakes formal independent client satisfaction surveys.  </p><p>The two surveys conducted in 2018 and in late 2020 were facilitated by a expert research firm.  Clients in central government, government agencies, local authorities and higher education institutions were surveyed. The 2020 survey achieved 386 respondents and its results indicate high levels of client satisfaction. Importantly gains were made across the majority of areas measured since 2018.  Most notably, the OGP staff scored highly throughout, in terms of professionalism, responsiveness, expertise, communication and understanding of client needs. </p><p>A number of key areas for further development were also identified, including the OGP website, procurement timelines, complexity, communicating the benefits of using OGP arrangements and ensuring future frameworks are targeted to meet needs and widely communicated to potential users.</p><p>A detailed summary of the results from both the 2018 and 2020 Client Satisfaction Survey are available on the OGP website via the following link - .</p></reply>

The Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  The Directives have been transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, the Planning Acts and the Wildlife Acts.</p><p>When lands are being proposed for inclusion within a special area of conservation, identified landowners are notified of the proposed designation and are sent an information pack on the relevant site. The information pack explains the scientific reasons for the proposed designation, sets out the activities requiring the prior consent of the Minister or of another public authority for that site and includes information on how to appeal against the proposed designation. A map showing the boundaries and extent of the site is also sent to landowners to help them to determine whether or not their land is located within the site proposed for designation.  </p><p>Notice of the proposed designation is also published in at least one newspaper with circulation covering the area in which the site is located, in one national newspaper and on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department. Adverts in relation to the proposed designation are broadcast on a radio channel generally available in the area in which the site is located and provided for display in local Garda stations, local authority offices, public libraries, local offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and offices of Teagasc.</p><p>A three-month period is provided for lodging an appeal against the inclusion of land within a site proposed for designation as a special area of conservation. Initially a Departmental review is undertaken in respect of an appeal. Where an appeal is unsuccessful/partly unsuccessful at the Departmental review stage, an appeal may be made to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board.  This board is comprised of representatives of landowners and of Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations, under an independent chairperson.</p><p>Following an appeal hearing, the board makes a recommendation to the Minister. This recommendation is based on scientific grounds as to whether the land should be included in the site proposed for designation. The recommendation of the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board may be accepted in full, in part or rejected and the appellant is informed of the decision of the Minister.</p><p>The process is completed with the formal designation of a site by Statutory Instrument.  Statutory Instruments made, to date, formally designating sites as special areas of conservation may be viewed at .</p><p>Each Statutory Instrument sets out the area of the special area of conservation, the activities requiring the prior consent of the Minister or of another public authority for that site, the qualifying Interests of the site (the natural habitats and/or species listed in Annex I and II of the Habitats Directive for which the site is protected) and the offence provisions.</p><p>After a site has been formally designated, landowners known to the Department are notified in writing of the formal designation of the site by Statutory Instrument. </p><p>Notice of the formal designation of the site is also published in at least one newspaper with circulation covering the area in which the site is located, in one national newspaper and on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department. Notices in relation to the formal designation are provided for display in local Garda stations, local authority offices, public libraries, local offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and offices of Teagasc.</p></reply>

The Programme commits us to expanding the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) and in this regard I have recently confirmed that a review of the funds operation is being undertaken.</p><p>Currently, the maximum funding allowable under the SSF is &euro;50,000 per unit. With &euro;310 million allocated to the SSF in 2019, this will provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on Local Authority lands. At least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated in this way. A further &euro;50 million has been allocated to the SSF in 2021. To date, SSF grants of &euro;198 million has been approved in principle in support of 39 projects in 14 Local Authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of over 4,200 homes.</p><p>Dublin City Council has been granted approval in principle for an SSF grant of &euro;18,750,000 in respect of the proposed development of its site at Emmet Road, Dublin 8 (the former St Michael's Estate). This infrastructure funding will support the delivery of approximately 375 homes for Cost Rental, which will form 70% of the total homes in the development. The remaining 30% of homes will be social housing and will be fully funded by my Department subject to the normal approval process.</p><p>In terms of direct funding for the Cost Rental units, in addition to my Department&rsquo;s SSF grant, Dublin City Council has indicated an intention to secure funding support to deliver these homes. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has expressed strong interest in supporting Cost Rental at Emmet Road, given the EIB's track record of supporting similar public housing projects across Europe. </p><p>I am fully aware that the loan period for debt funding is a key element in making Cost Rental more affordable for tenants, since it allows the initial capital costs of a development to be spread over decades. For example, the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, under which my Department is supporting Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver new homes for Cost Rental, involves forty-year Government loans to fund 30% of development costs. The AHBs concerned are pairing these very favourable CREL loans with forty-year loans on commercial terms from the Housing Finance Agency to fund the remaining capital costs.</p><p>Loan funding for the development of new Cost Rental homes at Emmet Road is primarily a matter for DCC, since the Council will be borrower, owner, and landlord, but there is a clear consensus about the benefits of long loan periods. I am aware that a representative from the EIB is supporting the work of the Council and engages on an ongoing basis with the Project Board overseeing the development.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-06a.194.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021050600072#WRD06300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 65 together.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended (the Act), all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.  Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, thereby facilitating more widespread generation of renewable energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.</p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for "glint and glare" impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department is presently engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. As such, these maps, which are a fundamental aspect of any amendments to the exemptions, are expected to be finalised in Q3 2021.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the length of time that it is expected to take to complete the aviation safeguarding maps, my Department has decided to adopt an interim measure which would allow revised regulations to be introduced prior to the completion of these maps, but with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations. My Department is consulting with the Irish Aviation Authority on this matter, and is working towards the development of the draft interim regulations in this regard, the precise details of which have yet to be finalised. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. The draft regulations will also be subject to screening under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC to determine whether they are likely to have significant environmental effects. If there are significant effects, the undertaking of an SEA will be required, which will include public consultation.</p>  <p>  The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in Q2 2021. These interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  The overall process for updating the solar panel planning exemptions to include the completed aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is still expected to be completed by Q4 2021.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government includes a commitment to deliver 50,000 new social homes with a focus on new build homes.  This commitment was underpinned by investment of &euro;3.3bn towards housing programmes in Budget 2021. Subject to the impact of COVID-19, this investment will fund delivery of 12,750 new social homes. Later this year we will be publishing a new Housing Strategy, Housing for All, to set out our ambition to deliver more homes across all tenures. The delivery of more affordable and social homes will be a key focus in the Plan. </p>  <p>  The High Level Housing Delivery Group provides a forum for engagement with key housing delivery partners and to provide input on the implementation of the commitments on housing delivery in the Programme for Government. The membership of the Group consists of representatives from the City and County Management Association, the Housing Agency, the Housing Delivery Coordination Office, Approved Housing Bodies and the Irish Council for Social Housing.

The CSO would provide statistical data on the mean and median prices of homes by local authority area. Typically, spending on housing of between 30% and 40% of net household income are used by policy makers and commentators as &lsquo;rule of thumb&rsquo; measures of affordability.   </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo;, clearly lays out our commitment to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through a number of measures, with &euro;468 million in affordable housing measures in Budget 2021 alone.</p>  <p>  Government has recently approved the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 and I intend to bring this before the Oireachtas in the very near future as part of the summer legislative programme. This Bill includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities, (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental.</p>  <p>  The Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) is available to local authorities, in areas where an affordability challenge exists, to provide affordable housing to buy or rent on their land. SSF funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 39 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of some 4,200 affordable homes. While the majority of SSF projects are currently at the planning and design stage, my Department continues to engage and meet with local authorities in order to progress approved projects, and to have preliminary discussions on potential future projects.</p>  <p>  The first two SSF projects that will deliver affordable housing are in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Cork. Fifty homes will be provided later in the year at the Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the first &lsquo;Cost Rental&rsquo; pilot programme. The first project that will deliver affordable homes to purchase is at Boherboy Road in Cork City, where 116 new energy efficient 2- and 3-bedroom homes will be delivered in six phases; with the first phase to be delivered by Q2 2021. Homes will range in price from &euro;198,000 to &euro;223,000.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Cost Rental project at Enniskerry Road, a further two projects are underway. Dublin City Council is progressing a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate) and the Land Development Agency is collaborating with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a site at Shanganagh, Shankill. Both of these projects have received approval in principle for SSF funding.</p>  <p>  The provision of Cost Rental housing is also being implemented through the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, with a Budget 2021 allocation of &euro;35 million. I have approved in principle the financing this year of 390 new homes across eight sites, located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork. CREL support and careful cost management has generated initial rents which are at least 25% below comparable open market prices, delivering significantly improved affordability for renters.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. The equity stake will fill the gap between the mortgage people have, and the price of a new home. In so doing, it will build confidence in the construction sector to increase housing supply. The proposed price caps for the equity scheme are reflective of the median price of a new home bought by first-time buyers, and are targeted to address the affordability gap in different places.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Land Development Agency is tasked with working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, state agencies, and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On its establishment, the LDA had access to an initial portfolio of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. Whilst the tenure mix for these homes has not been finalised, the LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation, on the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land, as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes.</p>  <p>  These measures are designed to increase housing supply at a time when needed most. They will get families into new homes at a price they can afford.</p>  <p>  Additional affordability measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (RIHL), are already available to eligible applicants.</p>  <p>  The Help to Buy Scheme has had 23,545 approvals by the end of February 2021, with the estimated total value of approved Help to Buy claims to date in the order of &euro;389.2 million.</p>  <p>  The RIHL is available for both new and second-hand homes. At the end of February 2021, the RIHL has had 3,817 approvals. Budget 2021 confirmed that &euro;210 million has been sanctioned for RIHL lending in 2021.</p></reply>

The issue of sale and of purchase of land or housing are matters for the Minister for Justice.  I am working with my Government colleagues to bring forward comprehensive proposals to address this issue as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  I would note that institutional investors occupy a relatively small share of the housing market which based on the last census in 2016 was more than 2 million houses and apartments.  Industry estimates suggest that the total number of residential units under institutional ownership in Ireland was approximately 15,550 at the end of 2020, less than 1% of the total housing stock.</p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. Data provided by the Residential Tenancies Board in November 2020 reports that the majority (over 70%) of landlords registered a single rental tenancy. </p>  <p>  The presence of such institutional investors in the market helps to increase the supply of housing, particularly of urban apartments, through forward-funding of development. This is essential to reaching the National Planning Framework targets and to support more sustainable living generally. However the possibility of a trend of investment emerging where already or nearly completed traditional family home estates are purchased in bulk is deeply concerning and not in line with Government policy. </p>  <p>  On Tuesday, 4 May last, I received Government approval for the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which I will shortly be bringing before the Oireachtas.  A key aspect of this Bill is the reform of Part V of the Planning and Development Act by increasing the existing 10% obligation for social housing in residential developments to a 20% obligation for social and affordable housing.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to prioritise the increase in the supply of homes and supports which enable first time buyers access their own home.</p></reply>

To date approximately 600 new social homes have been made available under Buy &amp;amp; Renew and I am keen that local authorities utilise this opportunity alongside the delivery of social homes through new build projects.  Full capital funding is available to the local authorities for all these delivery options.  </p>  <p>  The Repair &amp;amp; Leasing Scheme was also developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or approved housing bodies (AHBs), to harness the accommodation potential that exists in vacant dwellings across Ireland.  The cost of the necessary repairs are met upfront by the local authority or an AHB, with the cost of the repairs being recovered from the property owner by offsetting it against the lease payment, subject to the suitability of the dwelling for social housing.</p>  <p>  At end-2020, a total of 234 dwellings had been brought back into use under the scheme across a range of dwelling types, including over the shop properties, former bedsits, city centre terraced houses, and one-off rural dwellings.

This represents a decrease of 6,813 households or 9.9% on the last assessment in June 2019. Since 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 61,880, a reduction of 32.4%.</p><p>In relation to the question posed by the Deputy regarding the number of families that have in the year to date applied for local authority or special needs housing, information of this specific type is not held by my Department. </p><p>Below is the link to the summary report for 2020 which includes breakdowns by each local authority, across a range of categories, including details on households with a specific accommodation requirement arising from a disability. It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time snapshot of the demand for social housing support in each local authority area and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the housing waiting lists.</p><p><b>2020 Report</b></p><p>Each local authority has a Housing and Disability Steering Group to plan for and oversee the implementation of the local authority&rsquo;s five-year Strategic Plan under the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability (NHSPWD) 2016-2021. These groups were established in 31 local authorities to enhance the existing ad hoc inter-agency cooperation and to bring a more coordinated approach to the delivery of housing and related services.  They are made up of representatives from the local authority, Approved Housing Bodies, the HSE (with a representative from both Disability Services and Mental Health), and sectoral representatives&rsquo; groups from the areas of the four disability categories. </p><p>The Groups are also tasked with reviewing the targets in the local authorities&rsquo; Strategic Plans to ensure that they are realistic yet challenging and that they result in increased delivery of appropriate/varied types of housing for people with disabilities, and to also ensure that while the targets are based on the identified need (Housing Waiting List) that they take cognisance of emerging need as well. Since 2016, allocations of homes to persons with a disability has ranged from 10-12% of all allocations. The existing strategy is under review and public consultation and research has begun. It is intended that a new strategy will be published by the end of 2021.</p><p>In relation to affordable housing, the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 was approved by cabinet on the 4th of May 2021 &ndash; it is the first ever comprehensive standalone legislation providing for affordable housing measures. This will give a statutory basis for the introduction of the Affordable Purchase and Cost Rental schemes.</p></reply>

For 2021, I have set targets for Kildare County Council of 558 new social homes via build programmes and 153 homes through leasing.  The precise projects that will be advanced over the course of 2021, are a matter for Kildare County Council who have direct authority in this area.  The Council will be fully supported with funding from my Department based on the delivery they achieve this year and any additional delivery beyond these targets, will also be funded.</p><p>In recognition of the likely impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on all but a limited number of social housing sites, I recently announced additional measures to support the delivery of social housing in 2021 including a programme of targeted acquisitions by local authorities and an increased focus on Buy and Renew construction with a particular emphasis on rundown vacant properties that local authorities can repurpose as social housing units.</p><p>To provide transparency on new social housing projects being advanced, my Department publishes a Social Housing Construction Status Report each quarter with details of all social housing developments completed or under construction in each local authority area, including Kildare. The report for Quarter 4 of 2020 is available at the following link: .</p><p>The Government will be publishing a new housing strategy this year, which will set out details of social housing delivery out to 2025, including social housing targets for 2022 onwards. While Kildare County Council already has a social housing construction programme in train, I am keen that they are proactive in adding to this pipeline and in working with Approved Housing Bodies to advance their existing projects as speedily as possible. It is also important that the Council housing team has the continued support of Councillors and public representatives in advancing their social housing delivery projects.</p></reply>

The Act aims to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants and to support the Government's efforts to restrict the movement of people in order to suppress the spread of this virus.</p>  <p>  The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence. These tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations.</p>  <p>  Once the Minister for Health makes regulations restricting movement outside a 5 km radius of one's place of residence, the moratorium on evictions taking place takes effect. </p>  <p>  A moratorium on evictions taking place was in operation throughout the country from 31 December 2020 until midnight 22 April 2021 (12 April plus the 10 day grace period), with limited exceptions.</p>  <p>  Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (the PDRTA) provides for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January to 12 July 2021 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 July 2021. Rent increases are also prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 July 2021, with no back-dating allowed. These protections are designed to better balance the legal rights of landlords and tenant; a guidance document on the PDRTA is available on the RTB's website - www.rtb.ie.</p></reply>

The most recent data received in respect of the number of inspections of all private rental properties and those with HAP tenancies is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>HAP Inspections    carried out in 2019</th>       <th>Total Inspections carried out in 2019</th>       <th>HAP On-site Inspections carried out in 2020</th>       <th>Total On-site Inspections carried out in 2020</th>       <th>HAP Virtual Inspections    carried out in 2020</th>       <th>Total Virtual Inspections carried out in 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>23,424</td>       <td>40,728</td>       <td>12,031</td>       <td>24,315</td>       <td>991</td>       <td>1,388</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The following is the breakdown for the Cork Local authorities: <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>HAP Inspections carried     out in 2019</th>       <th>Total Inspections carried out in 2019</th>       <th>HAP On-site Inspections    carried out  in 2020</th>       <th>Total On-site     Inspections carried out in 2020</th>       <th>HAP Virtual Inspections carried   out in 2020</th>       <th>Total Virtual     Inspections carried out in 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City</td>       <td>441</td>       <td>1,042</td>       <td>176</td>       <td>473</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County</td>       <td>1,142</td>       <td>1,410</td>       <td>657</td>       <td>756</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Cork council boundaries changed on 31 May 2019. As a result any direct comparisons of year on year performance for the two councils would need to be cognisant of this fact.  </p><p>Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings &ndash; including those with HAP tenancies. The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s Local Authority Resilience and Recovery Plan for living with Covid-19 (October 2020) and its subsequent Local Authority Services Framework for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response (January 2021) do not permit rental inspections in Levels 4 and 5. This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and rental inspectors.</p><p>In response to the difficulties caused by pandemic restrictions, some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. Dublin City Council has led this initiative which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and being asked to confirm that any remedial works requested by the local authority have been completed, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so.</p><p>While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. I support these initiatives and my Department is encouraging local authorities not already involved in the pilots to consider adopting them. I have committed to providing Exchequer funding for those that do. Cork County Council committed to joining the pilot in January 2021 and Cork City Council have carried out  some virtual inspections.</p><p>Annual data in respect of the level of inspections carried out by each local authority is available on my Department's website at</p></reply>

In these areas, called Rent Pressure Zones (RPZ), rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% per annum. The annual rent increase restriction applies to both new and existing tenancies, irrespective of a change of landlord.</p><p>Not all properties in RPZs are subject to the 4% restriction.</p><p>An exemption applies to the first rent setting of a tenancy of a dwelling where:</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling during the two years immediately prior to this current tenancy beginning;</p><p>or</p><p>- no tenancy existed in respect of the dwelling where the dwelling is a protected structure, or is in a protected structure or is a proposed protected structure during the 12 months immediately prior to the current tenancy beginning. A protected structure is defined in the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 Act provides a legal definition of &lsquo;substantial change in the nature of rental accommodation&rsquo; to illustrate the type of works to be carried out to a rental property to qualify for an exemption from the annual rent increase restriction applicable in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs).</p><p>Such works shall result in:</p><p>- a permanent extension increasing the floor  area by 25%; or</p><p>- an improvement in the Building Energy Rating (BER) by at least 7 ratings; or</p><p>- at least 3 of the following:</p><p>- a permanent alteration of the internal layout;</p><p>- adaptations for a person with a disability;</p><p>- a permanent increase in the number of rooms;</p><p>- an improvement in the BER by 3 or more ratings where the original BER was D1 or lower; or</p><p>- an improvement in the BER by 2 or more ratings where the original BER was C3 or higher.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 do not stipulate a maximum or minimum rent amount to be charged in an area and places no obligation on a landlord to charge a rent. Section 19 of the Acts prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds the prevailing market rent. There is no legal obstacle to landlords reducing rents in an RPZ or elsewhere in the country.</p><p>During the pandemic, landlords are being urged to show forbearance to tenants with regard to the levels of rent payable and any arrangements that might be made should rent arrears arise. It is open to the parties to agree informal temporary rental arrangements during the pandemic and this does not contravene RPZ legislation. Such arrangements are viewed as a pragmatic response to the temporary impacts of Covid-19, lowering rents for tenants when most needed.</p><p>In order to better enforce RPZ legislation, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provided the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with enhanced powers and resources to carry out investigations and to sanction landlords if required, for any contravention of the 4% rent increase restriction in RPZs. The maximum sanction is &euro;30,000.  Alternatively, a tenant may wish to refer a dispute for resolution to the RTB and a lawful rent can be enforced and damages of up to &euro;20,000 can be awarded.</p><p>My Department, the Housing Agency and the RTB keep the operation of the rental market under review.  It is important to have rent transparency and a rental system with fair rent and certainty for tenants.  I intend to bring forward comprehensive rental legislation in the Autumn with provisions to address long term security of tenure, rent levels and the impact of on-line platforms taking units out of the rental market.  The matter raised will be examined in the context of that legislation.</p></reply>

The issue of sale and of purchase of land or housing are matters for the Minister for Justice.  I have serious concerns of instances, recently reported, where investors are inappropriately purchasing entire completed houses estates, preventing their sale to families and first time buyers.  I am working with my Government colleagues to bring forward comprehensive proposals to address this issue as a matter of urgency. </p><p>I would note that institutional investors occupy a relatively small share of the housing market which based on the last census in 2016 was more than 2 million houses and apartments.  Industry estimates suggest that the total number of residential units under institutional ownership in Ireland was approximately 15,550 at the end of 2020, less than 1% of the total housing stock.</p><p>Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. Data provided by the Residential Tenancies Board in November 2020 reports that the majority (over 70%) of landlords registered a single rental tenancy. </p><p>The presence of such institutional investors in the market helps to increase the supply of housing, particularly of urban apartments, through forward-funding of development. This is essential to reaching the National Planning Framework targets and to support more sustainable living generally. However the possibility of a trend of investment emerging where already or nearly completed traditional family home estates are purchased in bulk is deeply concerning and not in line with Government policy. </p><p>Over &euro;3.3 billion has been made available in 2021 for housing - the largest budget in the history of the State.  This year alone we are providing Capital funding of &euro;468 million specifically to cover affordability measures including:</p><p>- &euro;110 million for a new Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme and a new<b></b>Equity Loan Facility<b></b>to deliver Cost Rental homes;</p><p>- &euro;50 million in Services Sites Funding to deliver affordable purchase homes on Local Authority  lands;</p><p>- &euro;38 million in Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Funding which will support the delivery of homes on private lands including many discounted prices;</p><p>- &euro;210m for lending under  the Rebuilding Ireland Home loan for those who cannot secure the necessary commercial loan.</p><p>- &euro;205m to be spent by the Land Development Agency in its progression of housing including affordable homes.</p><p>- In addition, the Help To Buy scheme is also available via the Department of Finance.</p><p>The Government has recently approved the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 which will give a statutory basis for the introduction of the Affordable Purchase and Cost Rental schemes. I intend to publish the Bill very shortly bring it to the Oireachtas to allow its commencement this year.  The Bill will also reform of Part V of the Planning and Development Act by increasing the existing 10% obligation for social housing in residential developments to a 20% obligation for social and affordable housing.  </p><p>The new National Affordable Purchases Shared Equity scheme is currently being designed for private developments.  My intention is that this measure will be available nationally.  It will help bridge the gap, by means of an equity stake purchased by the State, between the maximum mortgage available to eligible households and the price of the new home they wish to buy.  The objective of the scheme will be to increase housing supply by activating viable planning permissions and to enable First Time Buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford sooner than would otherwise be the case.</p><p>In relation to Cost Rental, a range of work is ongoing to deliver this new form of housing. My Department is utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA), and the Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver projects in a variety of ways, in order to prove the concept of this new sector. This is in conjunction with the policy development for the sector that is set out in the forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill.</p><p>Cost Rental will be informed by National Planning Framework priorities.  It will be focused, at least initially, in densely populated urban areas where rental affordability pressures are particularly acute and where State resources can have the biggest impact. It is important that the State targets its affordability measures towards the parts of the country that are experiencing the most extreme affordability challenges.</p><p>One of the main sources of State funding for Cost Rental homes is the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, which was allocated &euro;35m in funding in Budget 2021. It gives Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) access to Government loans on favourable terms to cover up to 30% of the cost of new Cost Rental homes. Following the detailed assessment of submitted proposals, approval was granted for the funding this year of 390 new Cost Rental homes, located in Dublin, Kildare, and Cork. Cost-covering rents for these homes will be at least 25% below comparable open market prices. Further details of these homes, including precise locations, will be published when the successful AHBs have completed necessary commercial arrangements. I intend seeking an expansion to this scheme through the review of the National Development Plan and the Budgetary process, in order to give AHBs certainty of funding on a multi-annual basis and allow them to plan developments into the longer term.</p><p>In the meantime both the Help to Buy scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan remain available to eligible purchasers to make the cost of housing more affordable.</p></reply>

This new form of rental tenure will see rents linked to the cost of provision of homes, rather than being subject to the pressures of the open market. Rents will increase only in line with consumer inflation, remaining stable in real terms while continuing to cover management and maintenance costs. The growth of Cost Rental will mean a substantial continuing stock of more affordable rental homes becoming a feature of housing in Ireland over the longer term.</p>  <p>  Cost Rental homes will be operated and allocated in line with provisions in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 which was recently approved by Government. The Bill, which will be published shortly, defines Cost Rental in Ireland for the first time and will allow the Minister to regulate tenancies in which the rents only cover clearly defined costs. The primary eligibility condition intended for Cost Rental is the setting by the Minister of a maximum household income for new tenants. This will ensure that Cost Rental benefits the target cohort of moderate-income households, who have incomes above the limits for social housing supports and who are facing affordability pressures in the private rental market without any State support.</p>  <p>  The 14 December 2020 Call for Proposals for the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) invited applications from Approved Housing Bodies under certain conditions, one of which was that homes would have a cost-covering rent at least 25% below comparable open market prices in the local area. The CREL projects for which I announced approval in principle on 8 February 2021 meet this requirement. This is unrelated to the actual rents for the 390 new CREL-funded homes, which are calculated from the capital and current costs of delivering these dwellings. The 25% market discount benchmark was used primarily to screen applications at the assessment stage, in order to target limited State investment, in the form of the favourable terms of the CREL loans, at those projects which demonstrated significant impact.</p></reply>

With a view to giving effect to this commitment and the actions outlined in the PFG, a TCF Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) was established in November 2020 to consider the regeneration of our towns and villages. The IDG is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p><p>In parallel, a Town Centre First Advisory Group was also established to enable the experiences of a broader group of stakeholders to be brought to bear in informing the process of policy development, and will support the work of the IDG.  Following the initial development stages through the forum of the IDG and Advisory Group, four key pillar areas are now in development as part of a TCF framework, via the support of dedicated working groups tasked with addressing the following:</p><p>- Governance &amp;amp; Enabling Structures;</p><p>- Economic &amp;amp; Social Purpose;</p><p>- Living Towns Approach;</p><p>- Investment &amp;amp; Resources.</p><p>Work has progressed well and draft working group papers are currently being developed for discussion, initially with the IDG, in the coming weeks.</p><p>There is general consensus among all the groups that there is no one solution or issue that can or should be addressed in isolation but rather that a TCF framework should be holistic and capable of being tailored to address the individual needs, size and characteristics of a town.  Until such time as this work is further progressed and measures developed and agreed, it would be premature to comment on the specific matters raised.</p><p>The aim is that the Inter-Departmental Group will provide recommendations for consideration by Government in June.  It is envisaged that recommendations will cover the short, medium and longer-term out to 2040, to align with Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

Two outdoor ballcourts are also to be provided, one at ground level and the second at rooftop level.  My Department has aimed to provide as much play space as possible in the context of the restricted nature of this urban site and the level of school accommodation to be delivered.</p>  <p>  Due to the scarcity of land in urban areas it is not always possible to achieve the ideal site size for school buildings. Where some of the elements required for a school site can be provided outside the designated site area (e.g. traffic management, parking, playing fields, etc.), where it is possible to provide multi-storey (above two storey) buildings and where separation areas can be reduced due to the nature of permitted development on and adjacent to the site, smaller sites can be considered. Constraints in site sizes in urban areas mean that the full suite of external accommodation may not be provided in all cases. In such circumstances, priority is given to the provision of accommodation and services specific to the pedagogical requirements of the school. In many cases this will be in line with Local Authorities&rsquo; own development policies, e.g. encouraging sustainable transport methods thus reducing parking and set down requirements.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school  year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged. </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here: </p><p>The arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year are currently under review. An announcement on the matter will be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  Based on the public health advice published in July 2020, and the updated advice received from the HPSC on 7th August and from NPHET on the 18th August 2020, the Department has engaged with Bus &Eacute;ireann to ensure  that school transprt services fully operated in the current school year, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing using 50% of passenger capacity.  This requirement for 50% of passenger capacity applies to post-primary services only.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department has published guidance for schools in relation to school activities that traditionally take place in the last term, for example activities involving school tours sports days etc.  The private hire of transport services by schools for such activities are not within the remit of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme and any such arrangements are a matter for schools to organise and manage locally. The Department advises that any private transport arrangements organised by a school should comply with the general guidelines for children using School Transport Scheme Services and have appropriate infection control measures in place.  </p>  <p>  The Department has also published guidance for schools that provide various teaching and learning approaches, including bringing pupils outdoors and to local amenities to enhance learning, support social distancing, promote physical activity and help positive wellbeing. While from 10 May the easing of public health restriction provides for travel between counties, schools are encouraged to minimise the use of buses for school tours this year, to keep it local and avoid long trips. Where buses are involved in a school trip, it would be better to avoid whole year groups going on the same trip.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to educational trips are a matter for each individual school authority and it is the responsibility of each school authority to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place while children are participating in school trips and that all such activities are in line with public health guidelines.</p></reply>

To mitigate this, the Department provided a number of additional supports for children with Special Educational Needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage in 2020/21 school year. Additional guidance was provided for schools on how to provide for the continuity of schooling for these learners.  Extensive support and advice for schools regarding the provision of remote learning was also made available through the Department&rsquo;s support services and agencies, including for those pupils attending DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools is the main policy initiative of my Department of Education to address educational disadvantage at school level. My Department will spend over &euro;150million on supports for schools under the DEIS programme in 2021, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). This also includes in the region of &euro;16.2 million which will be provided to schools in the form of a DEIS grant for the 2021/22 school year. It is a matter for each individual school to determine how best to use this funding, but it is intended to support the objectives of the DEIS programme, including retention, attendance, literacy and numeracy. </p>  <p>  In March I announced an increase in the budget of the School Completion Programme and a reduction in the enrolment threshold for the allocation of an additional deputy principal in DEIS post-primary schools, from 700 to 600 students.</p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Service (TESS), which includes Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, Educational Welfare Officers and School Completion Programme staff, play a key role in supporting learners at risk of educational disadvantage and on supporting the return to school of all students. TESS staff continue to engage with students and families identified by schools as needing additional support, and will remain in ongoing contact with school principals to identify students who may need support.</p>  <p>  Guidance documents have been provided by the Department to support teachers on the re-opening of schools. These documents advise teachers to take time to identify where students are at in their learning and to build on this as a starting point. Schools have been advised to use all available supports, both in-school and community-based, to promote a positive, solution-oriented approach that will support all pupils to engage in learning, to achieve, to learn and to progress in their education and to help minimise the impact on those at risk of educational disadvantage or arising from a special educational need.</p>  <p>  Promoting wellbeing is a fundamental element of the Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support school communities as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities at this time. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  A whole-school team approach to planning is recommended in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response is aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope. </p>  <p>  Now that our schools have reopened and are settling back into their routines NEPS psychologists have an increased focus on both consultation and casework in schools with particular attention to the needs of individual students. Psychologists take a blended approach to the provision of casework to schools, working both remotely, and where appropriate in-school, depending on school protocols/plans and of the nature of need. This recognises that some aspects of casework will require the psychologist to work in the school, while other aspects of the work may be done remotely in order to minimise risk and maximise safety. </p>  <p>  In order to support the alleviation of learning loss and the transition of learners back to in-class education an enhanced programme of summer provision for children with additional needs and those who are experiencing educational disadvantage, similar to what was provided in summer 2020 is being developed and the details of how it will operate will be worked through with the education partners in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued engage with public health and the education partners to ensure that all schools, including DEIS schools, are supported as schools have reopened and learners have returned to the classroom.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school  year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here: </p><p>The arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year are currently under review. An announcement on the matter will be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Education Act 1998 recognises the particular responsibility of the education system with regard to supporting the Irish language. The language has particular social, historical and educational importance and is part of the unique cultural heritage of the Irish people. It is an aim of Government to increase on an incremental basis the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language.</p><p>In recognising the linguistic, social and cultural importance of Irish and English in Ireland, both languages are included as core subjects in the national curricula for recognised primary and post-primary schools and centres for education in Ireland.  This has been the case since the foundation of the State and the importance of the teaching of both languages in this way has been re-affirmed on a number of occasions by the State, including most recently in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.  </p><p>The only exceptional circumstances in which consideration may be given to granting an exemption from the study of Irish in the case of primary schools are set out in Section 2.2a, 2.2b, 2.2c and 2.2d of Circular 0052/2019 and in Section 2.2a, 2.2b and 2.2c of Circular 0053/2019 for post-primary schools. In line with the Department&rsquo;s policy however, schools are expected and encouraged to provide all pupils (including those granted an exemption), to the greatest extent possible and in a meaningful way, with opportunities to participate in Irish language and cultural activities at a level appropriate to their learning needs. In keeping with the status and cultural importance of Irish an exemption from the study of Irish is not intended to prevent a pupil/student from learning Irish and therefore A pupil/student holding an exemption has the option not to exercise the exemption granted, without any loss of the right to exercise it at a future time. This provides for the department&rsquo;s obligations to allow pupils/students with special needs equal access to the same curriculum as all pupils/students in keeping with The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act (2004)</p><p>In line with other department policies in the area of special educational needs, the circulars on the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish have moved away from a diagnostic categorical model to a needs-based model.  Therefore a psychological report or medical professional&rsquo;s report is no longer a requirement for granting an exemption from the study of Irish. When schools receive reports from a psychologist or other specialist recommending an exemption from the study of Irish  the onus is on the school to consider it in the context of their own testing and record of the pupil&rsquo;s performance in school. This is the evidence required by the circular.</p><p>An external report which recommends an exemption from a psychologists, speech and language therapist (SLT), Psychiatrist, GP or other practitioner, may be helpful to the school in considering how they are meeting an individual pupil/student&rsquo;s needs BUT is not the deciding factor for the Principal to grant an exemption. The circular requires the school to demonstrate evidence of intervention and differentiated support for those children/students who struggle with literacy, as well as the current level of in-school testing on discrete tests of word reading, reading comprehension or spelling.  This includes using evidence of needs over time.  As part of this process the school will administer discrete tests to identify the needs of the student.  It is these test results which inform intervention and need for any additional support.</p><p>For pupils with significant literacy needs, such as those where there are concerns that literacy attainments remain, despite intervention, at/below the 10<sup>th</sup>percentile, the school will most likely be providing support through the SET Teacher.  These teachers undertake assessment and identification of need as part of their problem solving approach and development of Student Support Plans.  The granting of an Irish exemption emerges from this process.  Therefore the school will have evidence on an individual&rsquo;s Student Support file to support the application.</p><p>The circulars apply to recognised English-medium primary and post-primary schools only therefore the record of the pupil&rsquo;s/student&rsquo;s  performance and any testing will be done in relation to English literacy skills, since English is the language of instruction of the pupil/student. Testing in Irish in this circumstance does not indicate the pupil&rsquo;s/student&rsquo;s ability to engage with learning across the whole curriculum and is not sufficient to meet the criteria outlined in the circulars. The exceptional criteria outlined in subsection 2.2.c of the circulars are for pupil&rsquo;s/student&rsquo;s with significant literacy needs which impact on their learning across the curriculum. An exemption from the study of Irish is not meant to address the needs of a student who is encountering difficulty with the study of Irish only.</p><p>In addition to a test score at/below the 10th percentile in one test (Word Reading, Reading Comprehension or Spelling), the pupil/student must have reached at least 2nd class and must also present with significant and persistent learning difficulties despite having had access to a differentiated approach to language and literacy learning over time. Documentary evidence to this effect is required including a Student Support Plan detailing:</p><p>- Regular reviews of learning needs as part of an ongoing cycle of assessment</p><p>- Target setting</p><p>- Evidence informed intervention and review, including test scores (word reading, reading comprehension, spelling, other scores of language/literacy) at key points of review.</p><p>At post-primary level an exemption from the study of Irish is an exemption from the requirements set out in Rule 21 of the Rules and Programmes for Schools, which states that the approved course for recognised senior pupils must include not less than five subjects, of which one shall be Irish.  </p><p>There is no requirement to sit or pass an Irish examination in order to achieve a Junior or Leaving Certificate.  The study of Irish is mandatory for all students except for those holding an exemption from the study of Irish.  However, as with any subject in the state examinations, a candidate may decide not to sit the examination for Irish.  The reasons for this will vary according to the candidate&rsquo;s own particular circumstances.  There are no plans to require students to pass Irish in order to achieve a Junior or Leaving Certificate. </p><p>Any decision not to present for examination in Irish should be made carefully and following detailed discussion between the candidate, their teachers and school principal.  When making a decision it is important to remember that the study of Irish is a common entry requirement for many third level courses and parents/guardians and students are advised to contact their school&rsquo;s guidance counsellor  to seek advice on how best to proceed.  Indeed, it is possible that a Reasonable Accommodation for State Examinations (RACE) might be a better route than an exemption from the study of Irish.  Further information on RACE  is provided by the State Examinations Commission on their website:  .</p><p>Entry requirements for third level programmes are set down by individual higher education institutions and there are requirements to achieve a certain standard of Irish as an entry requirement for National University of Ireland matriculation and entry for certain courses of study such as primary teacher education. A language exemption at third level is a matter for the individual third level institution.</p></reply>

For this reason and in recognition of the unique challenges faced by island schools my Department has provided additional supports to such schools.</p><p>As provided for in Circular 0012/2021 on the Gaeltacht School Recogntion Scheme and in previous circulars from 2017, each of the 8 primary schools on the islands in the Scheme have access to additional resources and supports to strengthen immersion education.  Most of the island primary schools are allocated an additional 5 hours or 7.5 hours per week, in line with pupil enrolment as set out in Circular 0012/2021.  These schools are also in receipt of an annual grant to purchase Irish-medium resources.</p><p>Each of the 5 island post-primary schools are also participating in the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme and are in receipt of 7 additional teaching hours per week, in line with school enrolment, for additional Irish-language support.  From 2018 onwards, a grant of &euro;1200 has been paid to each post-primary Gaeltacht school to purchase Irish-language teaching resources.</p><p>From 2019 onwards, the 5 island post-primary Gaeltacht schools have been given an opportunity to participate in the e-hub pilot project that utilises an online blended-learning provision to provide access to students to Leaving Certificate Physics. </p><p>3 island post-primary schools opted to participate in the e-Hub project  schools and these schools have been provided with additional resources including once-off funding (&euro;5,000) for each school to purchase technology equipment. An additional allocation of 4 teaching hours per week has been provided for each of the three participating post-primary schools where an e-mentor is required to support students.</p><p>The Digital Strategy for schools 2015-2020 sets out the Department&rsquo;s current policy on the use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment across the school sector. The implementation of the strategy in schools is supported by a Digital Learning Framework (DLF) and comprehensive digital learning planning guidelines, extensive CPD, resources and supports for teachers and school leaders. These supports are available to all schools.  In 2020, &euro;100m in grant funding issued to schools for ICT Infrastructure including some &euro;70,000 that issued to the Island schools. All schools have broadband connectivity funded directly by the Department through its Schools Broadband Access Programme.  The development of a new digital strategy is underway.</p><p>Following the submission of correspondence to the Department, including the Oireachtas report identifying the unique challenges facing island schools,<b></b>an intradepartmental<b></b>working group was established in the Department of Education to explore the options for addressing these challenges and to set out recommendations to support post-primary schools located on islands in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>A package of additional supports was provided for each of the five island post-primary schools from September 2018 onwards.  These supports are available in addition to the supports schools receive as part of the Gaeltacht Schools Recognition Scheme. The package of supports comprises:</p><p>- an additional teacher allocation for each of the island post-primary schools from an allocation of 1  full-time equivalent post to 1.5 full-time equivalent posts</p><p>- an additional ring-fenced budget of &euro;15,000 per annum for each school </p><p>- the establishment of Col&aacute;iste Naomh Eoin, that previously had the status of an Aonad Teanga, as an independent stand-alone post-primary school on Inis Me&aacute;in, County Galway.</p><p>While Budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small primary schools (i.e., schools with up to four classroom teachers), improvements to the staffing of these schools have been made in the last number of years.  Improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for two-teacher schools, situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction were introduced for the 2015/16 school year.  Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools.  </p><p>Where the school is the sole primary school on an island, the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  An additional appeal option was introduced for single teacher schools with pupils across 6 or more class groups, allowing them to apply for the appointment or retention of a second teacher on reduced enrolment thresholds.  Small schools have also benefitted from the improvements to the staffing schedule introduced in 2016 and 2018.</p><p>For the 2021/22 school year, an improvement of one point in the appointment threshold in primary schools has been introduced and schools will be provided with class teachers on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils which is a historical low ratio.  In addition, a three point reduction in the retention scale has also been introduced for September 2021.  These measures will help to ensure that less pupils are required to recruit or retain a teacher.</p><p>Below in tabular format is an overview of the payments that have been made from my Department to the <i>12 primary island schools</i>in 2020 and 2021 to date.  These grant payments are administered from various areas within my Department. </p><p>My Department provides each Educational Training Board (ETB) with pay and non-pay budgets to support its individual ETB schools, colleges, head office and other centres of education, which would include the 5 Post-Primary island schools. It is a matter for each ETB how best to utilise such resources across the schools in their region. In the 2020/2021 school year, Galway Roscommon ETB was allocated 15 teaching posts and Donegal ETB was allocated 9 teaching posts in respect of island schools, small schools, Gaeltacht schools and co-ed schools in single catchment areas.</p><p>The Department of Education  will continue to be represented on the Inter-Departmental Committee for the Development of the Islands, which was established by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2019.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-06a.311.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021050600074#WRF04900"><p>As the deputy is aware, the Irish language is accorded special status in Ireland and is protected by various pieces of Legislation and in particular Article 8 of our Constitution which states that &ldquo;The Irish Language as the national language is the first official language&rdquo;. The Education Act 1998 recognises the particular responsibility of the education system with regard to supporting the Irish language. The language has particular social, historical and educational importance and is part of the unique cultural heritage of the Irish people. It is an aim of Government to increase on an incremental basis the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language.</p><p>In recognising the linguistic, social and cultural importance of Irish and English in Ireland, both languages are included as core subjects in the national curricula for recognised primary and post-primary schools and centres for education in Ireland.  This has been the case since the foundation of the State and the importance of the teaching of both languages in this way has been re-affirmed on a number of occasions by the State, including most recently in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.  </p><p>The only exceptional circumstances in which consideration may be given to granting an exemption from the study of Irish in the case of primary schools are set out in Section 2.2a, 2.2b, 2.2c and 2.2d of Circular 0052/2019 and in Section 2.2a, 2.2b and 2.2c of Circular 0053/2019 for post-primary schools. In line with the Department&rsquo;s policy however, schools are expected and encouraged to provide all pupils (including those granted an exemption), to the greatest extent possible and in a meaningful way, with opportunities to participate in Irish language and cultural activities at a level appropriate to their learning needs. In keeping with the status and cultural importance of Irish an exemption from the study of Irish is not intended to prevent a pupil/student from learning Irish and therefore A pupil/student holding an exemption has the option not to exercise the exemption granted, without any loss of the right to exercise it at a future time. This provides for the department&rsquo;s obligations to allow pupils/students with special needs equal access to the same curriculum as all pupils/students in keeping with The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act (2004)</p><p>In line with other department policies in the area of special educational needs, the circulars on the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish have moved away from a diagnostic categorical model to a needs-based model.  Therefore a psychological report or medical professional&rsquo;s report is no longer a requirement for granting an exemption from the study of Irish. When schools receive reports from a psychologist or other specialist recommending an exemption from the study of Irish  the onus is on the school to consider it in the context of their own testing and record of the pupil&rsquo;s performance in school.  This is the evidence required by the circular.</p><p>An external report which recommends an exemption from a psychologist, speech and language therapist (SLT), Psychiatrist, GP or other practitioner, may be helpful to the school in considering how they are meeting an individual pupil/student&rsquo;s needs BUT is not the deciding factor for the Principal to grant an exemption. The circular requires the school to demonstrate evidence of intervention and differentiated support for those children/students who struggle with literacy, as well as the current level of in-school testing on discrete tests of word reading, reading comprehension or spelling.  This includes using evidence of needs over time.  As part of this process the school will administer discrete tests to identify the needs of the student.  It is these test results which inform intervention and need for any additional support.</p><p>For pupils with significant literacy needs, such as those where there are concerns that literacy attainments remain, despite intervention, at/below the 10<sup>th</sup>percentile, the school will most likely be providing support through the SET Teacher.  These teachers undertake assessment and identification of need as part of their problem solving approach and development of Student Support Plans.  The granting of an Irish exemption emerges from this process.  Therefore the school will have evidence on an individual&rsquo;s Student Support file to support the application.</p><p>The circulars apply to recognised English-medium primary and post-primary schools only therefore the record of the pupil&rsquo;s/student&rsquo;s  performance and any testing will be done in relation to English literacy skills, since English is the language of instruction of the pupil/student. Testing in Irish in this circumstance does not indicate the pupil&rsquo;s/student&rsquo;s ability to engage with learning across the whole curriculum and is not sufficient to meet the criteria outlined in the circulars. The exceptional criteria outlined in subsection 2.2.c of the circulars are for pupil&rsquo;s/student&rsquo;s with significant literacy needs which impact on their learning across the curriculum. An exemption from the study of Irish is not meant to address the needs of a student who is encountering difficulty with the study of Irish only.</p><p>In addition to a test score at/below the 10th percentile in one test (Word Reading, Reading Comprehension or Spelling), the pupil/student must have reached at least 2nd class and must also present with significant and persistent learning difficulties despite having had access to a differentiated approach to language and literacy learning over time. Documentary evidence to this effect is required including a Student Support Plan detailing:</p><p>- Regular reviews of learning needs as part of an ongoing cycle of assessment</p><p>- Target setting</p><p>- Evidence informed intervention and review, including test scores (word reading, reading comprehension, spelling, other scores of language/literacy) at key points of review.</p><p>At post-primary level an exemption from the study of Irish is an exemption from the requirements set out in Rule 21 of the Rules and Programmes for Schools, which states that the approved course for recognised senior pupils must include not less than five subjects, of which one shall be Irish.  </p><p>There is no requirement to sit or pass an Irish examination in order to achieve a Junior or Leaving Certificate.  The study of Irish is mandatory for all students except for those holding an exemption from the study of Irish.  However, as with any subject in the state examinations, a candidate may decide not to sit the examination for Irish.  The reasons for this will vary according to the candidate&rsquo;s own particular circumstances.  There are no plans to require students to pass Irish in order to achieve a Junior or Leaving Certificate. </p><p>Any decision not to present for examination in Irish should be made carefully and following detailed discussion between the candidate, their teachers and school principal.  When making a decision it is important to remember that the study of Irish is a common entry requirement for many third level courses and parents/guardians and students are advised to contact their school&rsquo;s guidance counsellor  to seek advice on how best to proceed.  Indeed, it is possible that a Reasonable Accommodation for State Examinations (RACE) might be a better route than an exemption from the study of Irish.  Further information on RACE  is provided by the State Examinations Commission on their website:  .</p><p>Entry requirements for third level programmes are set down by individual higher education institutions and there are requirements to achieve a certain standard of Irish as an entry requirement for National University of Ireland matriculation and entry for certain courses of study such as primary teacher education. A language exemption at third level is a matter for the individual third level institution.</p></reply>

With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  In most areas, school planning areas were based on traditional school catchment areas where all primary schools were assigned to an area (typically a population centre or town), containing one or more post-primary schools. With the introduction of Small Areas in Census 2011, these areas were amended to align with Census Small Areas. The current school planning areas take account not only of local groupings of schools, but also of natural boundaries, Census Small Areas and other local conditions.</p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required to accommodate oncoming demographics in that particular school planning area. There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.</p>  <p>  In relation to the development referred to by the Deputy, I can confirm that this area is predominantly located in the Sallynoggin_Killiney_DLR school planning area rather than the D&uacute;n Laoghaire school planning area or Booterstown_Blackrock school planning area. Only parents of eligible children that reside in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire or Booterstown_Blackrock school planning areas are eligible to submit a parental preference for schools being established in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire or Booterstown_Blackrock school planning areas. </p>  <p>  An expression of a parental preference for patronage of a school is not an application for enrolment and does not confer any entitlement to a school place. Once the school has been established, parents may apply directly to the school in relation to their child&rsquo;s enrolment.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise the enrolment of children from within the school planning area which the school was established to serve. It is important to note that this does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established. Where there are places available, applicants for enrolment should be admitted by the school (in accordance with any further prioritisation determined by the school).</p></reply>

The CMO has made it very clear in his advices to Government which are published on gov.ie, that schools are safe environments, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections of children and adolescents occurs outside the school setting.</p>  <p>  Schools have put significant infection prevention control measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to/within the school and funding of almost &euro;650 million has been put in place by my Department to fund COVID-19 related measures, including funding for PPE, sanitation and additional cleaning etc.  </p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of COVID-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the infection control measures promoted by HPSC.</p>  <p>  The HPSC advice advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc.</p></reply>

It is important to note that entitlement to DA is not contingent on the nature of the disability but, subject to a number of other conditions, on the extent to which a particular disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity for work.</p>  <p>  The system of social assistance supports provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.</p>  <p>  Disability allowance is a means-tested payment, legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse/partner, if applicable) applying for the scheme.  The means assessment reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those who need it most.  </p>  <p>  The Department is not currently considering a universal payment approach to replace  the means testing of income supports, such as disability allowance.  </p>  <p>Any change to the assessment of means for schemes, including for disability allowance, can only be considered within an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 994,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  </p>  <p>  While I have sympathy for all persons who incur significant travel expense in their daily lives because of a disability, extending the free travel scheme to the cohort of people highlighted by the Deputy on the basis that their disability prevents them from holding a driving licence cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  The total combined spending on the above payments to carers in 2020 was &euro;1.2 billion.</p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant will be paid to carers this year at an estimated cost of over &euro;265 million. This is a payment for carers throughout the State and is paid in June each year, not just to people in receipt of a carers payment, but also to other carers who may not be dependent on State income supports.  An estimated 123,100 carers will receive the grant in respect of 141,200 care recipients.  In recognition of the vital role that carers provide in our society, the Carers Support Grant was increased by &euro;150 in Budget 2021 to bring the rate up to &euro;1,850 &ndash; the highest ever rate at which it will have been paid since its introduction. </p>  <p>  Disability Allowance (DA) is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability who are aged between 16 and 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.</p>  <p>  The annual expenditure on DA for 2020 was over &euro;1.8 billion. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that any increases in Carer's Allowance or Disability Allowance can only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources.</p></reply>

To that end this Government committed to ending the Direct Provision system and to replacing it with a new International Protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach. The Government also committed to developing a White Paper to set out how the new system will be structured and the steps to achieving it.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I published the White Paper to End Direct Provision and to establish a New International Protection Support Service on 26 February 2021. My Department is currently now working to implement the proposals cointained therein.  </p>  <p>  As part of the White Paper process we listened to the voices of children in Direct Provision and to the OCO. The new model has the human rights of children at its core. The new International Protection system will respect the rights of children and will provide child-friendly services, including a child-friendly vulnerability assessments. This was agreed with the OCO during the development of the White Paper.  The new model will combat isolation and help children to integrate into their new communities by promoting English language support and other school-based supports. Furthermore, by promoting an own-door accommodation model for families, a child&rsquo;s right to privacy will be more fully respected under the new system. </p>  <p>  In launching the report referred to by the Deputy, the Ombudsman for Children, Dr Niall Muldoon, noted the very positive engagement of the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department and I can assure him and this House that my Department  will continue to engage with the OCO to address the issues identified in his report.</p>  <p>  Although the report was only recently published the Ombudsman's investigation leading to its publication was commenced in 2018.  Work has been undertaken since then by IPAS on some of the issues raised in the report.  IPAS has developed a series of actions, planned for the short to medium term, to ensure the recommendations in the OCO report are implemented in full and as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  A new dedicated Customer Service unit is now in place and part of its remit will be proactively to engage with residents in IPAS accommodation centres to establish effective methods of communication, including as regards children living in IPAS accommodation.  Any resident may contact the IPAS customer service unit by email at: ipasinbox@equality.gov.ie with any issues and my officials in IPAS will work to resolve them without delay.  </p>  <p>  In addition, a confidential Freephone telephone support service, funded by, but independent of, my Department, was established in May 2020 to provide further support to residents who are being accommodated by my Department. This Freephone confidential support helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS).  Any complaint made through this service may be passed in confidence to IPAS for investigation and resolution.</p>  <p>  International Protection applicants will have the right to pursue a grievance or complaint about any aspect of the services that they receive through the accommodation process.   International Protection applicants will continue to have recourse to the Ombudsman and to the Ombudsman for Children, to pursue an issue of concern about their experiences in the system.</p>  <p>  The existing Child and Family Services Unit will be enhanced and incorporated into a new Resident Welfare Team that will develop a case management system for families and children identified as having special reception needs at the vulnerability assessment stage.  The Unit will review family needs regularly to ensure that those needs continue to be met as a family progresses through their application.  The Resident Welfare Team will be a multi-disciplinary team with experts from the fields of education, health and childcare seconded.</p>  <p>  The IPAS has also engaged Barnardos to provide training to all centres and emergency accommodation locations, on 'Understanding Child Development through a Trauma Informed Lens'. This training began rolling out last year and will assist with ensuring that centre staff and managers are aware of the impact of trauma on children and understand how that may inform the behaviour of any child or indeed adult who has been impacted by trauma.</p>  <p>  The key priority will be to move all remaining children and families still in residing in congregated hotel style living, to own door or independent living accommodation. Therefore a public procurement process will take place in 2021 with the aim of securing the additional spaces required to enable IPAS to end the use of emergency accommodation.  The procurement will have a specific focus on the provision of child friendly accommodation that will allow parents and children to enjoy a normal private family life.  </p>  <p>  A new Vulnerability Assessment process is currently being piloted by the IPAS.  The pilot commenced in December 2020 and was extended to all new applicants for International Protection from the beginning of February. The purpose of these assessments is to determine if an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, what those needs are and what actions are required to address those needs. Assessment questions are based on the various categories of vulnerability identified within the EU Reception Conditions Directive 2013/33/EU, and have been refined within the Irish context with the help of the HSE.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of years, Tusla has seconded a social work team leader to IPAS. The secondee manages the Child and Family Services Unit in IPAS and provides Children First and associated training to accommodation centre staff and maps out with the centre manager how to engage with local family support services. There are many examples of projects established in local areas to assist families, living in IPAS accommodation, integrate into local culture and to support parenting.  </p>  <p>  The Children and Family Services Unit manager also assists Tusla social workers and families if a child welfare or protection concern arises while a family is living in an accommodation centre. The Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees (CYPSC) National Coordinator and the manager of the Child and Family Services Unit work closely on liaising with other third party services who provide supports to children and families living in centres around the country. </p>  <p>  Since the recent publication of the OCO report, Tusla has committed to publishing their Direct Provision Policy, 2021, for all staff working with children and families living in direct provision accommodation. The policy states that each Direct Provision accommodation centre will have a named point of contact within the relevant Tusla area. The policy also clarifies the ongoing  role of the Children and Young Persons Services Committees (CYPSCs) in co-ordinating services and ensuring that children in direct provision are included in these services.</p>  <p>  All existing centres and all new centres are required to develop a child safeguarding statement.  An IPAS Audit of compliance will take place this year in cooperation with Tusla.  Safeguarding Statements will be translated and made available to all residents. Additional child safety training will also be rolled out to all centre managers as COVID restrictions allow.   </p>  <p>  IPAS will continue to work with Tusla during 2021 to develop interagency protocols and operating procedures that will support the sharing of case information between Tusla and IPAS and to track and monitor referrals and cases from beginning to end.  </p>  <p>  All of this activity will be supported through the provision of additional human resources to IPAS and the transition team to help meet the parallel challenges of addressing identified weaknesses in the current system in the short term and implementing the White Paper proposals for a not-for-profit service delivery model to replace the current system in the longer term.  I understand that recruitment in this regard has already commenced. </p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla is reviewing its IT system to plan for the next stage of the development of the National Child Care Information System (NCCIS) and consideration will be given to enable referrals children living in IPAS accommodation, along with other specified groups of children, to be tracked on a national basis.</p></reply>

In advance of its dissolution, the Commission deposited a very large archive relating to in excess of 100,000 individuals which includes audio recordings and witness statements of individuals who provided evidence and engaged with the different elements of the infrastructure of the Commission including the Confidential Committee and the Investigation Commission. </p><p>The report of the Commission at pages 10 and 11 of the Chapter on the Confidential Committee provides statistical information on the engagement of individuals with different elements of the infrastructure of the Commission.  The table below includes a summary of the data published in that chapter:- <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of people</th>       <th>Detail</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>886 </td>       <td>Who seemed to be within the Commission&rsquo;s remit, contacted the Commission and were sent information about the Confidential Committee. </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>673 </td>       <td>Completed the application form </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>19 </td>       <td>Gave evidence to the Commission and not to the Confidential Committee </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>550 </td>       <td>Met the Confidential Committee. (Some people who met the Confidential Committee also gave evidence to the Commission.) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>104 </td>       <td>Completed the application form but did not meet the Confidential Committee </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>304 </td>       <td>Were resident as mothers </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>228 </td>       <td>Were resident as babies/children </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17 </td>       <td>Were involved in other ways. </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Unfortunately, the information requested by the Deputy is not immediately available and would require extensive work to extract it from the voluminous records received from the Commission. </p><p>The archive now in the possession of my Department is organised by reference to individuals. Seeking to provide the information requested would require the expenditure of a very significant amount of staff time and resources, searching by reference to each individual in the many archive databases, and searching hard copy records.</p><p>My Department is focusing at present on putting systems and resources in place to manage the archive, respond to Subject Access Requests (SARs), arrange for the transfer of appropriate content to the National Archives, and meet all the legal obligations and commitments made.  The Department is making good progress in this regard, and is very keen to deal with the applications for information from the archive as quickly as possible.</p><p>A new Unit has been established to look after this hugely important and significant volume of work. This work has included ensuring that there is a range of expertise including data protection expertise within the Unit.  In addition, the Department has engaged external data protection expertise to support the processing of requests from data subjects and to appropriately vindicate the rights of data subjects.</p><p>Officials in my Department who process SARs from individuals completed data protection training delivered by external consultants to ensure that they are appropriately equipped to respond to requests in respect of the archive.  The training provided by external consultants is supplemented by in-house data protection expertise.  </p><p>Access to the archive is restricted to officials who need to have access for the purposes of their work.  Currently, 27 officials have access to the archive. </p><p>As of 30 April last my Department has received and is processing 158 SARs relating to the archive.</p><p>Given the sensitive nature of the personal data, my Department must validate the identity of every requester seeking their personal data. My Department engages with data subjects to request proof of identity, in the form of a scanned copy of a passport, driving license, or other photo ID. This is a reasonable measure for a data controller to take, to satisfy itself that the requestor is who they say they are, and that the personal data is being provided to the person it relates to. </p><p>My Department is seeking to provide individuals with a copy of their personal data within one month of the identity of the requestor being validated. The General Data Protection Regulation provides that the one month period may be extended by a further two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity of the request. The data controller is obliged to inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of the receipt of the request including the reasons for the delay. In accordance with GDPR requirements, in situations where my Department is unable to provide individuals with the data within this timeframe due to the complexity of the request, my Department informs individuals within one month of receipt of their request, explaining the reason for the delay, and my Department commits to delivery of the data within a further two months. My Department is responding to each data subject in accordance with its GDPR obligations and engages with each data subject in relation to the progress of their request.</p></reply>

When permissible, face to face training is operating at approximately 50% normal capacity to ensure adherence to public health guidance.  This has exacerbated the increasing pressure on craft apprentice off-the-job training facilities which was growing as a result of the 90% increase in apprentice population over the past 6 years, a situation which has impacted on waiting lists for electrical, plumbing and carpentry and joinery in particular.</p>  <p>  &euro;20M in capital expenditure has been allocated to SOLAS and the HEA to facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places across the system in the coming period in addition to &euro;12M already allocated to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures.  SOLAS and the HEA are working with the education and training providers to tackle waiting lists for off-the-job elements of programmes to ensure that apprentices complete their training as quickly as possible once COVID-19 restrictions allow.</p>  <p>  In the interim, education and training providers have front-loaded remote training on theoretical aspects of apprenticeship for craft apprentices to ensure that apprentices are facilitated to continue with their programme.  A phased return to face to face training has commenced for those apprentices who had been undertaking remote teaching and learning or who were close to completion of phase 2, 4 or 6 when training was suspended in January 2021.</p>  <p>  SOLAS and further and higher education providers are providing regular updates for apprentices and employers of apprentices who are assigned to off-the-job training phases.

Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes.</p>  <p>  Under the Department's Free Fees Initiative, the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible first time undergraduate students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses (including medicine courses). In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including previous education attainment.</p>  <p>  Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants.</p>  <p>  However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the HEA. In academic year 20/21 the state contribution is &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p>  <p>  The HEA is currently collecting details of student numbers for GEM for the academic year 2020/21 &ndash; and therefore the final numbers for GEM students for 2020/21 are not readily available.</p>  <p>  Based on the 2019/20 GEM student numbers:</p>  <p>  - The estimated cost of increasing the HEA contribution towards GEM (grant per student) by &euro;5,000 per student is an additional c.&euro;4.7m</p>  <p>  - The estimated cost of increasing the HEA contribution towards GEM (grant per student) by &euro;10,000 per student is an additional c.&euro;9.5m</p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of fees to be charged in the case of GEM fees are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p></reply>

As such, in addition to standard academic requirements for entry to an apprenticeship, eligibility criteria are in place to ensure that the programme reaches its target population.  Applicants must therefore meet a minimum of three of the following criteria: </p><p>- Family income under &euro;45,790. </p><p>- Parents in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment. </p><p>- Parents or applicant in receipt of a medical card. </p><p>- Attended a DEIS School. </p><p>- Come from an area of designated disadvantage. </p><p>- Parents have not attended higher education. </p><p>- Have been in the care of the State.  </p><p>An interim review of the programme by Quality Matters, which was published in September 2020 did not recommend any changes to the eligibility criteria. The final evaluation report, which will cover the period from January 2019 to April 2021, will examine opportunities and challenges for the programme in greater detail. </p><p>The Further Education sector provides a range of pre-apprenticeship programmes for learners who wish to undertake a short course in subject areas relevant to apprenticeship to assess their interest and aptitude for apprenticeship careers. These may be accessed at www.fetchcourses.ie.</p><p>Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, the impacts of and outcomes from the TU Dublin Access to Apprenticeship programme, pre apprenticeship programmes and other interventions across the sector such as apprentice bursaries will be examined to provide an evidence base for best practice and future interventions.</p></reply>

The licensing of property services providers ensures that licensees comply with certain standards aimed at ensuring protection for their clients and users of their services. For example, licensees must possess specified minimum qualifications, have available to them professional indemnity insurance, pay an annual contribution to the Compensation Fund, and keep records of all offers received in respect of land which is offered for sale.    </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Compensation Fund is to provide compensation to clients of licensees who have sustained a loss as a result of the dishonesty of a licensee as well as individuals to whom a refund of a deposit is due from the licensee. </p>  <p>  Professional indemnity insurance provides cover in respect of any description of civil liability on the part of a licensee arising from any provision of property services.  </p>  <p>  The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers (including complaints made by purchasers or potential purchasers of property), and to carry out investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations.  Improper conduct is defined in the Act as the commission by a licensee of an act which renders him or her no longer a fit and proper person to provide property services, the commission of a contravention of a specified provision of the Act or of a provision of regulations made under the Act, or the giving by the licensee of a statement of advised market value or advised letting value of land (including buildings) which is clearly unreasonable. </p>  <p>  It is open to a purchaser or potential purchaser of property to engage any professional assistance that he or she considers necessary. </p>  <p>  While my Department keeps the operation of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 under review, I have no plans at present to amend the Act in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease public health measures, the approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services. </p>  <p>  As part of the plans announced by Government last week, a phased reopening of the hospitality sector is envisaged. From 2 June, accommodation services can reopen and from 7 June outdoor services in restaurants and bars can resume. The resumption of indoor hospitality more broadly will be considered at the end of June. As set out above, there is still a high level of infection nationally, therefore this phased approach is recommended to ensure that reopening is sustainable.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that indoor restaurant and bar services within hotels and other accommodation facilities must be restricted to overnight guests/residents only. This is currently the case for those staying in these facilities for essential purposes and is also in line with previous practice for these facilities during periods of Level 3 restrictions. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.</p>  <p>  Under this roadmap, it is envisaged that gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres will reopen from the 7 June for individual training. At present, restrictions are being eased at a national level and not at a regional or county level. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, the approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

A person seeking international protection can apply for and be assessed for a medical card.  Services provided include access to a GP, medical prescriptions, dental care, optician care, pregnancy services and children&rsquo;s health.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my colleague Minister O&rsquo;Gorman published A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to establish a New International Protection Support Service on 26 February 2021.  The new International Protection system will respect the rights of children and will provide child-friendly services, including a child-friendly vulnerability assessment.</p>  <p>  As part of the white paper, the Department of Health and the HSE have proposed an enhanced model of health care for international protection applicants.  It responds to the main issues facing this population group, covering public health, mental health and physical health. The model is in line with the HSE intercultural health strategy and the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s approach to intercultural health as outlined in the &lsquo;Second National Intercultural Health Strategy 2018- 2023&rsquo; is to support the diverse ethnic and cultural groups in obtaining equal access and opportunities across the Irish health care services.  The HSE recognise that a coordinated approach is important in the planning of new accommodation centres and agree that health services need to be involved at an early stage to assess local capacity to meet increased demand. Existing primary care services must be supported when new centres are opened.</p>  <p>  A new Vulnerability Assessment process is being piloted by IPAS.  The purpose of these assessments is to determine if an applicant is deemed to have special reception needs, to identify those needs and to identify what actions might be required to address those needs. Assessment questions are based on the various categories of vulnerability identified within the EU Reception Conditions Directive 2013/33/EU.</p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of the Report of the Ombudsman for Children on the Safety and Welfare of Children in Direct Provision and have considered its findings as they relate to the health services. I am committed to working with the HSE to meet the health needs of people seeking international protection in direct provision centres, in collaboration with IPAS and other service providers.</p></reply>

There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community. Under the provisions of the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012, a GP can enter into a State contract to provide GP services provided he/she is on the Medical Council's Specialist Register in the Speciality of General Practice, irrespective of the number of GPs who are already established in an area.</p>  <p>  Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.

There are currently no GMS GP vacancies in the counties concerned.</p>  <p>  While there are no plans to carry out an audit of the GP services in these locations, the Government, aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. </p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) over the period 2019 - 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GP Agreement on contractual reform and service development. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 213 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021.  The ICGP noted a record number of applications for the 2021 GP training programme.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p><p>The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to improve access to care, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.

However, a number of legal issues were identified which necessitated further consideration. Given the large volume of priority legislative work which has arisen within the Department of Health during the last year as part of the response to Covid-19, as well as the additional workload across Government, it has been necessary to place work on several areas on hold due to the diversion of resources. </p>  <p>  Since services under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced in January 2019, there has been a limited number of reports of protests or other actions relating to termination of pregnancy.  This is an extremely positive development, suggesting that termination of pregnancy services have bedded in relatively smoothly to date and are becoming a normal part of the Irish healthcare system, in line with Government policy. </p>  <p>  However, where problems do arise with protests outside health care services, there is existing public order legislation in place to protect people accessing services, employees working in the service and local residents. The Department of Health has previously liaised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na around safe access to termination of pregnancy services, and the Garda National Protective Services Bureau issued a notice to all Garda Stations raising awareness about the issue. The notice directed that any protests be monitored, and breaches of existing law dealt with. The Department has provided information on existing public order and other relevant legislation to the HSE for appropriate distribution.  </p>  <p>  Services for termination of pregnancy under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 have continued to function during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is regular ongoing engagement between my Department and the HSE to facilitate the smooth-running of the service and to resolve any issues that may arise.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by: </p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most; </p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country; </p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p><p><i></i></p><p>It is important to note that the NIAC has advised that there is no evidence to show a significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease, independent of age and other comorbidities, in any occupational group other than frontline healthcare workers to prioritise them for vaccination abovetheir age-cohort.</p></reply>

Cancer services continue to operate in line with guidance issued by the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP).</p>  <p>  The NCCP is continuing to closely monitor trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment. The total number of patients seen across all Rapid Access Clinics (RACs) in 2020 (44,233) amounted to 88% of the 2019 figure (50,249). GP e-referrals to RACs for weeks 2-17 (up to 25th April) this year stand at 153% of the activity in the corresponding weeks in 2020, and 126% for the corresponding weeks in 2019.</p>  <p>  Medical and radiation and oncology services are continuing, utilising the safeguards of social distancing and infection prevention &amp;amp; control measures built up in the past year.  The number of patients receiving chemotherapy up to end-2020 was at approximately 88% of 2019 activity, while radiation oncology was operating at >90% of 2019 activity. </p>  <p>  An important message to everyone now is that, if you have any concerns about cancer please go to your GP, who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. Our cancer diagnostic and treatment services are open, and our healthcare staff will provide any necessary care.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;12m has been allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels. This funding will support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support. It will also support virtual clinics and more accurate triage, and facilitate infrastructure and minor equipment purchases to increase capacity across Rapid Access Clinics and surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology services. </p>  <p>  In addition, as part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year. This funding will facilitate developments across prevention, diagnosis, treatment and patient supports.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time. </p>  <p>  The announcement made last week include the following changes to the measures applying to weddings: as of May 10, there can be an increase in the number of guests attending wedding services to 50 which brings this figure in line with the numbers permitted at religious services.  </p>  <p>  This increase to 50 guests relates to the service (both religious or civil) only. The number of guests attending a wedding celebration or reception should remain at 6 guests for indoor gatherings and 15 guests for outdoor gatherings. From 7 June, subject to the epidemiological situation at the time, it is envisaged that the numbers of guests attending a wedding celebration or reception will increase to 25. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.</p>  <p>  Under this roadmap, it is envisaged that gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres will reopen from the 7 June for individual training.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;vaccine bonus/dividend&rdquo; provisions currently in place are guided by public health advice and are specifically focused on social visits to private homes to alleviate the impacts of social isolation. From 10 May, those that are fully vaccinated may visit with other fully vaccinated people, providing there is no more than 3 households present and those that are fully vaccinated may visit with unvaccinated people from a single household, provided that they are not at risk of severe illness and there is no more than 3 households present. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, the approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

In the health sector, the HSE has deployed rapid antigen tests for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from rapid antigen tests undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Operational planning is also underway in the HSE in relation to the piloting of testing using RADTs in education and childcare settings. This includes development of guidance documentation, a training programme and other related templates and resources to support the testing pathway for educational facilities. The antigen assay to use for the pilot has been selected and stakeholder engagement is ongoing. I am also aware that a further rapid testing partnership initiative by a number of universities, supported by partners including the HSE and HIQA, is also being scoped for piloting in the near future.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Antigen Validation Project Team has conducted a validation study of antigen testing in meat processing facilities. A further pilot of rapid antigen testing in this sector is being overseen by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, supported by the HSE. At the request of the HSE Antigen Test Working Group, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was requested to examine the impact on transmission risk and resource requirements of different approaches to serial testing using rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) in meat processing plants. The result of this analysis was published on 30 April 2021. HIQA modelled the impact of different serial testing scenarios using RADTS in these settings both in addition to, and as an alternative to, the current practice of monthly RT-PCR-based serial testing. HIQA found the preferred testing strategy used RADT-based serial testing once weekly with positive antigen tests confirmed by RT-PCR. It should be noted that HIQA has stated that, as the data collected is specific to the environment of meat processing plants, it would be inappropriate to apply the results of this analysis to other settings.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Report of the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Group&rdquo; which was chaired at my request by the Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, and published on 1 April 2021, made a number of recommendations for sectors outside the health sector and these are a matter for the Ministers and Departments with responsibility for the sectors concerned.</p></reply>

Development of the plan involves a number of stages, including SWOT analysis, needs assessment, intervention design, financial allocations, target setting (including monitoring) and governance systems. The draft CSP will also be subject to an ex-ante evaluation, Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment including a public consultation on the draft CSP and draft Environmental Report.</p>  <p>  I have, with my officials, continued to engage extensively with stakeholders on the future of CAP. Consultations on the development of the CSP will continue via the CAP Consultative Committee, which comprises representatives of the main stakeholders including farm bodies, NGOs (including the Environmental Pillar), industry representatives and academia. It also includes representatives from Government Departments including DPER, DRCD, DECC, DHLGH (NPWS), and Government Agencies, including Bord Bia, Teagasc and the EPA. The Committee has met on 17 occasions with further meetings planned throughout 2021.</p>  <p>  Further public consultations on the development of the CSP are being considered. I will also continue to engage with stakeholders as we develop our CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 to meet the deadline of submission to the Commission by 1st January 2023.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently opened the innovative and ambitious Results-Based Environmental Agri Pilot Project (REAP) for applications. The aim of this pilot is to trial an agri-environment results-based scoring system at a national level with a view to identifying up scaling potential for possible inclusion in the next flagship national agri-environment scheme. This model makes it worthwhile for participants to gain an understanding of the conditions required for the delivery of optimum biodiversity and environmental benefits.  Similar to the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) projects, REAP is designed to focus on key learning objectives.</p>  <p>  REAP is a step towards the development of our next national agri-environment scheme which, subject to EU approval, will be in place by early 2023.</p></reply>

Within the current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), significant levels of support have been provided under Ireland's Rural Development Programme (RDP) in this regard as part of the development of our Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS).</p>  <p>  For example, the RDP includes support for 23 projects across a range of key areas under the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) initiative. These projects are designed to increase the sharing of knowledge and innovative approaches in a way that incorporates a wide range of stakeholders. Further  EIP tranches have also subsequently been launched in areas such as farm health, safety and wellbeing and the rewetting of peatlands.  In addition, the RDP included significant investment in the Knowledge Transfer Programme, which saw support for the training of over 18,000 farmers over three years in a range of key areas.</p>  <p>  While the negotiation of the regulations to underpin the new CAP programming period are still ongoing, it is intended that our new CAP Strategic Plan will also include a range of initiatives aimed at developing our national AKIS through support for high quality knowledge exchange and training, and ensuring the flow of research and innovation between all the key stakeholders. The Department is also developing targeted high quality training interventions for the cohort of agricultural advisors in a range of priority areas, including the areas of biodiversity and water quality.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department's most recent call for research proposals which closed in Quarter 1 of 2021 offered the opportunity to develop multi-actor approaches and knowledge transfer and exchange within research projects including the funding of innovation intermediaries. This development offers each project that will be  funded the opportunity to develop a proportionate knowledge transfer plan with a focus on engagement with stakeholders to co-create research solutions and disseminate research outputs.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Agri-Food Strategy to 2030 outlines the intention to develop a dynamic knowledge exchange environment.  Action 4 (of Mission 4, Goal 3) proposes to develop an enhanced enabling environment to support on farm innovation and diversification, and facilitate peer-to-peer learning and knowledge transfer through  development, testing and sharing of knowledge and experiences through for example focus groups, living labs, incubators, and other co-operative activities. The draft strategy also sets out the intention of prioritising more farmer engagement and peer to peer learning and advice tailored to the primary producers in their local area and capitalising on the expertise and communication skills of farmers through more farmer-led talks, videos and other outreach activities. A public consultation on the Strategic Environmental Assessment of this draft strategy is currently underway.</p></reply>

The measure provides support for artisan, micro and small food and beverage businesses including for the renovation and extension of production facilities, the purchasing of processing equipment, as well as market development, competitiveness, and innovation.</p><p>The LEADER Food Initiative is implemented through the LEADER Local Action Groups under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development. Recently, <i>'Our Rural Future</i>', the Government&rsquo;s ambitious new policy for the development of rural Ireland, launched in March 2021, outlines the importance of the Agri-food sector and in particular the role that the LEADER Food Initiative continues to play to support artisan, micro and small food producers, (new or existing) to develop and innovative their businesses.</p><p>Food and farmers' markets have experienced considerable growth in recent years. I am pleased that Bord Bia has developed webinars on farmers&rsquo; market skills training workshops to support new and existing members of the food market network. The workshops provide practical solutions to the challenges most frequently faced by market sellers. A guide to selling through farmers markets, farm shops and box schemes in Ireland is also available.</p><p>The Programme for Government includes commitments to encourage and support local authorities to expand the number of farmers&rsquo; markets, farm shops and food emporiums, and to support the formation of community-owned markets in all towns, showcasing local food produce from local farmers, growers and food producers. In addition to the supports outlined above, my Department is engaging with other relevant Departments to explore further options.</p><p>The Draft 2030 Agri-Food Strategy embraces a food systems approach. The draft Strategy is now the subject of an Environmental Assessment Public Consultation, open until 15<sup>th</sup>June. The draft Strategy has a high ambition for primary producers, focusing on the premiumisation of output, increased integration of certain sectors, diversification of activity and income streams as well as enhancing consumer trust in our food system, providing evidence of a safe, ethical and environmentally sustainable food supply.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current measures in place, along with those proposed in the Draft Agri Food 2030 strategy, will provide a sound basis for the future development of local food and innovative food production initiatives.</p></reply>

The EU regulations which govern the relevant schemes do allow for coupled schemes in a range of sectors. However, the Department has only taken up this option to implement a coupled scheme via the Protein Aid Scheme. This scheme provides a coupled payment for farmers who grow the eligible crops of peas, beans and lupins.</p>  <p>  Under the &euro;250 million Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme, there is a requirement for farmers to meet a minimum stocking density requirement of 0.15 livestock units per hectare.  Given the aim of this scheme in supporting farmers on marginal lands, this minimum stocking requirement is set at a low level and derogations are available for lower requirements to apply in certain circumstances linked to the nature of the land and environmental issues.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of this minimum stocking density is to maintain an extensive level of grazing on the marginal lands in question, thus helping to mitigate the risk of land abandonment and under grazing. Substituting beehives for livestock unit in this instance would thus run counter to the design of the scheme in this regard.</p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge the important contribution bees make to agriculture and biodiversity as both pollinators and honey producers. In this regard, the Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations. These supports include funding to carry out applied research through the National Apiculture Programme, grants to national beekeeping associations and grant aid to fund capital investments for beekeepers.  My Department is also a partner in the All Ireland Pollinator Plan 2021 &ndash; 2025 and is a member of the All-Ireland Honeybee Strategy Steering Group.</p></reply>

DAFM Circular 18/2020 confirms that for sites that are screened in for Appropriate Assessment, a well-developed Harvest Plan (or equivalent) is essential, as it is likely to inform part or all of the site level mitigation associated with the appropriate assessment. This applies equally to Coillte and private applicants.  Many private sector applications, screened out for appropriate assessment, have been approved in the absence of a Harvest Plan.</p>  <p>  Harvest plans or equivalent that are submitted to the Department tend to be prepared to varying standards. In all cases, decision makers assess the information that is available to them on a case by case basis to decide if this information is sufficient for them to either issue the licence or seek further information.  For Coillte applications submitted in March this year, the Department has requested that Coillte submit further information in support of these applications. This includes a site specific harvest plan map for individual sites with an appropriate level of further detail that will allow the Department to reach a decision on whether or not to issue the licence. </p>  <p>  There are specific staff assigned to processing Coillte licences comprising both forestry inspectors, ecologists and administrative staff. The Department keeps these figures under continuous review as we do all staffing to ensure that we can meet the needs of all applicants. In 2020, the issuing of licences was relatively balanced with 52% of felling licences issuing to Coillte and 48% to private applicants (in volume terms). To date this year in 2021, the breakdown is 60% to Coillte, 40% to the private sector.</p></reply>

Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature are exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am expressly precluded from getting involved in operational matters such as this.</p>  <p>  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) will set out new procedures in relation to this changed position. The Authority has, I understand, already written to industry representatives to make them aware of the situation and also met with the Sea Fisheries Protection Consultative Committee, Industry Representatives and operators on the matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s queries as to the implications, if any, of the Commission&rsquo;s revocation of the control plan on operational matters such as safety, costs etc are matters for the SFPA.  I have accordingly referred the queries on these matters to SFPA for attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

The Action Plan will build on significant work already underway by the Department, including:</p><p>1. Continuing to provide vital supports to the farmers, fishers and foresters which are the lifeblood of a balanced rural and coastal economy and community.</p><p>2. Finalising and publishing a new 10-year Strategy for the agri-food sector - delivering on a key commitment of the Programme for Government, which called for an ambitious blueprint for the sector for the years ahead, taking into account our climate action and environmental obligations.</p><p>3. Developing Ireland's CAP Strategic Plan.</p><p>4. Designing, developing and commencing new transitional schemes for 2021 including an Agri-Environment results-based Pilot Project which rewards farmers for committed environmental effort by linking payments to the quality of environmental outcomes delivered.</p><p>5. Implementing Ireland&rsquo;s first over-arching Animal Welfare Strategy.</p><p>6. Working to develop initiatives and policies to underpin and support farm and fisher incomes.</p><p>  The Department makes direct payments to Irish farmers of almost &euro;1.9 billion annually, under CAP and national schemes. In addition, it funds research, advisory and training supports which directly benefit Irish farmers, and, along with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, co-funds a number of preferential loan schemes to the benefit of primary producers. Farmers also benefit significantly from a range of agri-taxation measures, which are particularly focused to support land mobility and generational renewal.</p></reply>

Depending on the overall result of a farmer's annual herd test, the overall result of neighbouring farmers' annual herd test along with possible other causes of TB within an area, further TB testing may be required. The causes for the outbreaks of TB cases across the country are various and require a range of actions to address the problem - there is no one-size fits all approach.</p>  <p>  Within each county, the TB programme focuses on wildlife, how disease is distributed in the area, contiguous programmes, gamma interferon testing, cleansing and disinfection, testing compliance and frequency, and isolation of reactors. Each TB outbreak is investigated by a Veterinary Inspector (VI) to identify the source of infection. In the case of every outbreak involving two or more standard reactors, there is a VI visit to advise the herd owner on how to eliminate infection and necessary measures to assist in reducing the risk of recurrence. This occurs in all relevant cases in Wicklow.</p>  <p>  It has been a challenging year in terms of TB in Wicklow West. As of 2nd May 2021, herd incidence there is 15.79% compared to 4.26% nationally. As increased number of herds are identified as being infected, additional testing follows in a systematic way. The Department continues to implement a badger removal programme in West Wicklow as it does in other relevant areas where an epidemiological link has been established between badgers and serious cattle TB breakdowns. In order to eradicate TB in West Wicklow, the Department has engaged with farmers via a Newsletter issued in January 2021 to provide advice on steps farmers can take to reduce TB risk.</p>  <p>  The Department is engaged with all stakeholders through the TB Forum to ensure all aspects of recently launched new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030 are addressed to move forward towards eradication of the disease. This new TB Strategy and further information is available on www.bovinetb.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-06a.771.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021050600082#WRO03800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266, 267, 268, 269, 271, 272, 273 and 274 together.</p><p>I am working to ensure that sustainable vibrant communities continue to live on the islands, and I have made this one of the key elements of <i>Our Rural Future</i>, the Government&rsquo;s new Rural Development Policy.  Furthermore, my Department is currently developing a new National Islands Policy, a central objective of which is to ensure that sustainable vibrant communities continue to live on the offshore islands.</p><p>In order to inform the policy, a consultation process has taken place with the island communities and is ongoing with other relevant stakeholders. This work has assisted in identifying the main challenges faced by communities living on the offshore islands. Many of the issues raised by the Deputy have featured in the responses to the consultation process.  Figures from the Central Statistics Office show a decline in population on many of the offshore Islands, with an older than average population, and a higher proportion of retired people living on islands compared to national figures. There are challenges in terms of employment, education and access to services. </p><p>These and other issues have been, or will be, the subject of bilateral meetings with the relevant Departments and Agencies in the context of the policy development, and they in turn will be providing their own input and expertise on elements of the policy. </p><p>My Department provides funding for island supports such as transport services, capital and infrastructural work and local development support.  My Department works with the relevant Local Authorities to address infrastructural projects identified by them. These works, which are jointly funded by the Department and the Local Authorities, include road improvements, works to combat coastal erosion, works on piers and slipways to improve access, and the provision of public facilities.  In the coming days, I will be announcing funding allocations under this programme, which will see funding being provided to Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Cork County Councils. Additional projects have been submitted for consideration, and I look forward to being able to announce additional funding very shortly. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, many of the supports available to island communities are delivered through the relevant Departments or State Agencies. Islands are free to avail of national schemes &ndash; such as economic and employment supports, funding for research, education, training and other such schemes run by agencies, local authorities etc.  </p><p>The Department of Social Protection does provide an island specific allowance (Island Increase) to recipients on specific islands. The objective of the scheme is to compensate for the additional costs of living on these specified islands when compared to people resident on the mainland. This payment is an increase to the weekly payment of certain social welfare payments, to recipients who are aged 66 or over and are ordinarily resident on an island off the coast of Ireland. It is also paid to people who are aged under 66 and in receipt of Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance, Incapacity Supplement or Blind Pension. I announced an increase in this payment as part of the 2021 budget.</p><p>In terms of repairs to housing stock, I am informed that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage supports local authorities for a range of stock improvement programmes, such as, the Voids programme, the Energy Efficiency programme, Disabled Person Grants, and also programmes of Regeneration. Funding is also provided for housing adaptation grants on privately owned dwellings for Older People and People with a Disability to allow them stay in their own home and within their own communities as long as possible. These programmes are not island specific and it is a matter for each local authority to submit a work programme in this regard. </p><p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage does however provide funding towards the necessary work to renew or repair thatched roofs of applicable properties. &euro;3,810 or two thirds of the approved cost (whichever lesser) is payable towards necessary works under this programme. A higher grant (up to &euro;5,714) may be payable for houses on specified Islands. For Medical Card holders, the maximum grant is &euro;6,350, or up to 80% of the approved cost (&euro;8,252 for Islands). This grant scheme is administered directly to the public by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p><p>Once completed, the National Islands Policy will provide a series of actions, across Government, to support, promote and empower our island communities. The policy will provide a basis for the development of an action plan to address the challenges identified, and to foster the future development and sustainability of communities on the offshore islands.</p></reply>

The programme supports private enterprises and community groups in rural areas including the islands. </p>  <p>  The programme is delivered to the off-shore islands by the Donegal, Mayo and West Cork LAGs through its Implementing Partner, Comhar na nOile&aacute;n CTR, while the Galway West LAG, Forum Connemara CLG, covers the Islands off the coast of County Galway.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I launched the Transitional LEADER Programme which came into effect from 1 April 2021 and will run to the end of 2022. A total of &euro;70 million is being made available over this programming period. &euro;65 million of this budget is available to Local Action Groups (LAGs) who deliver the programme and approve projects at local level. This allocation covers both core project expenditure and the administration costs of the LAGs.   </p>  <p>  The funding distributed between the LAGs is on a pro-rata basis, commensurate with the allocations made at the start of the 2014-2020 LEADER programme.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;3 million of the funding is being allocated to support Co-operation projects and innovation between LAGs, while the remaining &euro;2 million is being provided to support strategy development for the next LEADER programme. Further funding opportunities under the LEADER Food Initiative remain in place until the entirety of funds are exhausted.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I also approved an increase in the rate of aid for private enterprises, including those on the islands, and commercial community projects, from a maximum of 50% to a maximum of 75% for projects approved on or after the 1 April 2021.  </p>  <p>  This increased rate of aid will help stimulate the rural economy and sustain jobs within rural and Island communities, particularly in a post-COVID recovery scenario.</p></reply>

The road transport portion of this service is fully wheelchair accessible and all staff are fully trained in assisting with patrons with reduced mobility.</p><p>These measures form part of the transport contracts that are funded by the Department and are in place to ensure reliable year round access routes to and from the islands for all patrons.</p></reply>
