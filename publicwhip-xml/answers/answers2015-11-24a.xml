In respect of the Air Corps, the principal aim over the lifetime of the White Paper will be to ensure that the Air Corps can continue to undertake the required military operations and to deliver a broad range of air supports to other Government Departments and agencies in line with Memoranda of Understanding and Service Level Agreements.  These supports include:</p><p>-  Provision of a general helicopter capability for a variety of tasks, including support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>-  Provision of a fixed wing maritime patrol service.</p><p>-  Provision of a Ministerial air transport service.</p><p>-  Provision of an emergency inter-hospital air ambulance service and an emergency aeromedical support service on the basis of agreed arrangements between my Department and the Department of Health and the HSE.</p><p>-  Provision of aeronautical support to other Government Departments and Agencies, including the Irish Coast Guard.</p><p>In relation to the Air Corps&rsquo; military operations, the White Paper provides for periodic updates to consider progress made and any revisions required in the light of the security situation pertaining at that time.  These matters are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

I have previously outlined to the Deputy and the House the position with regard to the procurement of defensive equipment by the Department of Defence. </p>  <p>  I have also explained the scale and type of such equipment that the Department has acquired from Israeli companies in recent years and the purpose of such acquisitions which is to afford the greatest possible force protection and operational effectiveness to Irish Defence Forces personnel particularly on overseas service.   </p>  <p>  The matter of barring Israeli companies from entering tender competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo on such goods from Israel and this raises, inter alia, serious implications for Irish foreign policy which are outside my remit as Minister for Defence.  As the Deputy is aware, trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level.    </p>  <p>  As I have said in the past, the manner in which the Department of Defence procures both goods and services remains constant with international best practice and is in line with EU and UN decisions on trade embargoes.  I do not, therefore, envisage any change to our current procurement practices.</p></reply>

In addition to bilateral contacts, two meetings of EU Defence Minister&rsquo;s are held during each six month EU Presidency.  I attended the meeting of Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers, which took place in Brussels on 17th   November 2015.  Discussions at the meeting covered a wide range of European Defence and Security issues and associated challenges. </p>  <p>  Following the recent appalling events in France, I extended my condolences to the French Defence Minister and the French people, and pledged Ireland&rsquo;s support for France at this difficult time.  I stated that Ireland will support France in any way it can and will engage with France on a bilateral basis as to how Ireland might be of further assistance.   </p>  <p>  We are engaging with the French Authorities and I expect that the framework within which the request for aid and assistance, military and otherwise, will be clarified in the coming days.  I will report to Government in due course on the potential Defence Forces contribution to address the areas for aid and assistance specified by the French authorities. </p>  <p>  I am also kept fully appraised of issues arising from meetings which officials from my Department and the Defence Forces attend in the area of European Defence and Security.  As with the formulation of any policy, best practice and lessons learnt in other jurisdictions will always inform EU policy formulation to ensure that it is robust, coherent and meets the needs of member States.</p></reply>

At the time of the decision, the Defence Forces were already engaged with Irish enterprise and various consortia in support of research on a range of capabilities.  This engagement included EU funded research projects under framework 7 and Horizon 2020 and projects being undertaken within the framework of the European Defence Agency.  The Government decision allowed for greater engagement with EI and EI supported companies which could contribute to Defence Forces capabilities across the full range of its activities.  Subject to the provisions of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 2009, the Defence Forces participate in relevant capability development projects at European level under the umbrella of the European Defence Agency.  Enterprise Ireland also support Irish based enterprise and research institutes in accessing research opportunities in the European Defence Agency.    </p>  <p>  Through the Irish Maritime Energy and Resource Cluster (IMERC), which is a partnership of the Naval Service, University College Cork, and Cork Institute of Technology, the Naval Service has been involved in various initiatives with Enterprise Ireland within its capability requirements sphere.  Essentially these are dual use projects where the technologies have application in both the civil and military field. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are a military force.  Given the nature of their role on robust overseas operations, they need access to the latest communications and surveillance technologies and weapons systems in order to carry out their duties safely and effectively.  This means having weapons guidance systems, simulators, surveillance systems, communications, robots and drones along with all the other elements of force protection.   </p>  <p>  I can confirm that there are no proposals to support the development of an armaments industry in Ireland.  However, there are opportunities to develop new technologies and to further develop and enhance existing systems and capabilities which will have dual military and civil application through engagement between Irish enterprise and research centres and the Defence Forces.  The aim is to maximise synergies across both the civil and military domains and to develop leading edge technology and systems here in Ireland.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may request assistance from the Defence Forces in the context of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP).  Significant and continuous effort is put into ensuring that the Defence Forces remain up-to-date with regard to best national and international practice in terms of military thinking and practice. </p>  <p>  Significant training expertise exists within the Defence Forces and this expertise is continually benchmarked against best international practice.  Where the capability exists, relevant training is delivered in-house by highly trained and knowledgeable training instructors.     </p>  <p>  Where appropriate, Defence Forces personnel are also sent on relevant external courses, both within Ireland and internationally.  In this regard, Defence Forces personnel have attended courses run by armed forces in the United Kingdom, the USA, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey, amongst others.  These courses include topics such as anti-terrorism, Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (CIED) and Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN).   </p>  <p>  Ireland participates in NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) which has provided the Defence Forces with the opportunities to enhance their capabilities for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates. Membership of the Partnership for Peace has allowed the Defence Forces to gain access to NATO standards - which are internationally-recognised as representing best military practice.  The scope of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multi-national environment.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the Defence Forces, including access to training and up-to- date technology, enables the Defence Forces to carry out their numerous roles both at home and overseas, including any roles that are assigned to them by Government in any emergency situations that may arise in the role of Aid to the Civil Power.   </p></reply>

Explosive Ordnance Disposal is also a task assigned to the Defence Forces by Government and is provided in Aid to the Civil Power.  Within the Defence Forces, the Explosive Ordnance Disposal function is assigned to the Ordnance Corps.    </p>  <p>  I am informed by the military authorities that there are a number of vacancies within the Ordnance Corps at present.  However, the Defence Forces do not disclose the exact number of vacancies in the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit as this information is operationally sensitive.  That said, I can advise the Deputy that I am assured by the Chief of Staff that he has the necessary resources to undertake all roles assigned by Government, including Explosive Ordnance Disposal.  In addition, the number of callouts has fallen significantly over the past three years from 250 callouts in 2013 to 126 to date in 2015. </p>  <p>  While a number of Ordnance Officers have left the Defence Forces over the past 12 months to pursue professional opportunities outside of the Defence Forces, new staff are currently being recruited to the Ordnance Corps and a number of officers are currently undergoing the requisite training programme to fill current vacancies.  A planned programme of ongoing recruitment and training of Ordnance Officers to address current and future vacancies is also being put in place. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-24a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015112400060#WRB00300"><p>Rates of remuneration and conditions of employment in the Irish public sector have traditionally been set by reference to relative levels of pay across the various parts of the Irish public sector.  In this regard, the level of remuneration in the Defence sector has maintained relativity with the levels available in other related public sector employments.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2013 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 define current pay policy.  I believe that measures contained in the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) and the recently introduced Budget 2016 will be of benefit generally to members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).</p>  <p>  The LRA proposals apply to all public servants, including members of the PDF, who accept the terms of the Agreement. I understand that members of the PDF who are represented by the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO) have already voted to accept the LRA proposals.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) are due to ballot on the Agreement in December. </p>  <p>  The LRA proposes to increase salaries during 2016 and 2017 in a manner which will disproportionately benefit the lower paid.  These benefits come in the form of increases in gross pay in 2016 for those earning up to &euro;31,000 and in 2017 for all those earning up to &euro;65,000. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Pensions Related Deduction (PRD), which is commonly referred to as the &lsquo;Pension Levy&rsquo;, the exemption threshold for payment of the &lsquo;Levy&rsquo; will increase substantially during the course of 2015 and 2016 from &euro;15,000 to &euro;28,750 which means that annual income subject to the levy below &euro;28,750 will no longer be liable to the deduction.</p>  <p>  In regard to Budget 2016, various measures will be introduced which will reduce the Universal Social Charge (USC) burden on the lower paid through reductions in rates and increases in exemption limits. Budget 2016 also provides for the introduction of a weekly PRSI credit for certain Classes of PRSI whose weekly earnings are between &euro;352 and &euro;424. </p>  <p>  The tax implications of the various measures outlined in the LRA and Budget 2016 will vary depending on individual circumstances but the measures are weighted in favour of the lower paid who will receive a disproportionately higher percentage pay increase.</p></reply>

I have asked the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff to submit a joint implementation plan which will identify priorities, responsibilities and timescales in relation to implementing the White Paper.  Work on development of the implementation plan is ongoing.  With regard to the development of a new Institute for Peace and Leadership at the Curragh, the Government has committed to evaluating and developing this concept over the coming months.  It is foreseen that the new Institute would have international standing and contribute to the overall development of knowledge and experience in the areas of peace support and conflict resolution.</p>  <p>  Initial scoping work in relation to the development of the concept for the Institute has commenced within the Defence Organisation however it is too early in the process to identify specific timescales for the establishment and roll out of the proposal.</p></reply>

Going forward, the equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service will be considered in the context of the lifetime of the recently published White Paper.  The White Paper recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured.   </p>  <p>  In the context of the Air Corps fleet, this includes the replacement of the Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  In addition it is intended that the two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft will also be replaced.  The current EC 135 and AW 139 helicopter fleet in the Air Corps will continue to deliver the required Defence Forces support and other support capabilities over the lifetime of the White Paper.  The existing Pilatus PC9 training aircraft are not due for replacement until 2025. </p>  <p>  The current Naval Service ship replacement programme will have replaced three Naval Service vessels when completed by July 2016.  The White Paper recognises that a minimum eight ship flotilla will be required.   </p>  <p>  The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas.  There will be a focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles and the most cost effective option of upgrading or replacing the current fleet will be identified.  A small number of armoured logistical vehicles will be procured for force protection overseas. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will ensure that the Defence Forces are fully equipped to meet the roles placed on them.</p></reply>

As I stated at that meeting, I am committed to the future of Custume Barracks as an important, operational military Barracks.

There are also plans for a major refurbishment of the Barracks&rsquo; Dining Hall in 2017.</p>  <p>  At the time of the re-organisation there was some speculation that the number of PDF personnel serving in Custume Barracks would be reduced by figures that varied from 400 to 600 personnel.  This was based on an incorrect assumption that there were approximately 1,400 personnel permanently based in Custume Barracks at that time.  The figure of 1,400 personnel appears to be based on the number of personnel that would have been permanently posted to Custume Barracks if the PDF strength was at 11,500 personnel.  This PDF strength level has not been seen since the 1990&rsquo;s. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the establishment strength for units based in Custume Barracks is 995.  The military authorities have advised that the strength of personnel in Custume Barracks, Athlone as at 31st October, 2015 was 919.  Recruitment is ongoing.</p></reply>

Ireland's continuing active engagement in EU Battlegroups enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the EU, in particular, the role Battlegroups can play in reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN operations.  The United Nations strongly supports the development of Battlegroups as a capability that could be made available in support of UN mandated missions.  It also supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with like-minded States.  Participation in EU Battlegroups further supports Ireland&rsquo;s international security and defence policy and enhances our bilateral relations with contributing Member States. </p>  <p>  The 2016 German led Battlegroup will comprise Germany, acting as Framework Nation, Ireland, Luxembourg, Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.  The total number of Irish Defence Forces personnel involved in this Battlegroup will be approximately 175 personnel.  The Defence Forces contribution will involve a Recce/ISTAR Company together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force headquarters.  The role of a Recce/ISTAR Company is to generate and deliver specific information and intelligence to decision makers in support of the planning and conduct of operations. ISTAR can be characterised as the co-ordinated direction, collection, processing and dissemination of timely, accurate, relevant and reliable information and intelligence. </p>  <p>  As is the case in all Battlegroups, each participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a Battlegroup operation.  Equally, each Battlegroup participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  Accordingly, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the German Battlegroup will be subject to the &ldquo;Triple-Lock&rdquo;.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence identifies the priorities for the investment of these funds over the coming years.

He requested that consideration be given to the contribution of women soldiers to UN operations and that Ireland might factor this into its approach to such operations.  The recent White Paper on Defence highlights the importance of UNSCR 1325 in setting out the vital role that women can play in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, peace building, post-conflict reconstruction, reform and governance.  This, and subsequent UN Women, Peace and Security (WPS) resolutions, call on nations to ensure that a gender perspective is included in the planning and conduct of all military operations, something that is particularly relevant in circumstances where gender based violence has occurred.</p>  <p>  In the continuing development of the State&rsquo;s approach to overseas peace support and in response to the Secretary General&rsquo;s comments, the Department is examining the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s request in consultation with the UN and will engage in due course with other stakeholders involved, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to explore the contribution of gender focused measures, particularly in relation to the appropriate formation and deployment of female personnel.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that the Government remains committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and that the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties, including in respect of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.</p></reply>

The Irish contingent comprising 197 personnel is based primarily in Camp 2-45 as part of a joint battalion with Finland.  The decision by Government to send troops overseas is never taken lightly.  The safety of all Irish Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions is always a concern to me, my Government colleagues and to the military authorities.  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of mission specific training.  Such training, which is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of increased threat, has been designed to allow Defence Forces personnel to carry out their tasks and to provide for their protection. </p>  <p>  Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment to carry out their mission.  This equipment enables troops to fulfill the roles assigned to them, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission.  In addition to training and equipment, ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and both equipment and force assets are continually reviewed to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfill their roles. </p>  <p>  The reality is that no peacekeeping mission is without danger.

Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to further participation of Defence Forces personnel in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis having regard to the objectives of the mission, clarity of mandate, the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved.</p></reply>

Samuel Beckett is the third Irish Naval vessel deployed to the Mediterranean to assist the Italian Authorities with the migrant crisis, in line with the Government Decision on 12 May 2015.  L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett is continuing the excellent work undertaken by L.&Eacute;. Eithne and L.&Eacute;. Niamh in the Mediterranean.  The role of the Irish Naval vessel is to provide a search and rescue capability and to undertake humanitarian rescue operations at sea in the Mediterranean.  Assistance to persons in distress at sea is being provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of international conventions governing search and rescue situations.  Co-ordination of search and rescue efforts and the provision of humanitarian assistance is being achieved through close co-operation with the relevant Italian authorities.   </p>  <p>  During her deployment in the Mediterranean, L.&Eacute;. Eithne rescued a total of 3,377 migrants.  She was replaced in the mission on 18 July by L.&Eacute;. Niamh who rescued a total of 4,127 migrants during her deployment.  Tragically, 39 bodies were also recovered by L.&Eacute;. Niamh. </p>  <p>  L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett, commenced patrolling duties on the waters between Libya and Sicily on 01 October 2015.  To date L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett has rescued 1,088 migrants.   </p>  <p>  The success of the operations carried out to date by L.&Eacute;. Eithne, L.&Eacute;. Niamh and L.&Eacute;.  Samuel Beckett involving the rescue of 8,592 migrants demonstrates clearly the value of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in this important humanitarian response.   </p>  <p>  During my recent visit to L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett on 08 November, I met with Lieutenant Commander Geraghty and his crew and commended them on providing an invaluable service in assisting with the crisis in this region.  I thanked them on behalf of the Government for the outstanding role they have played, in what can be very difficult circumstances, in saving the lives of men, women and children, some of whom are fleeing desperate circumstances.   </p>  <p>  L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett is scheduled to complete its deployment in early December 2015 subject to ongoing assessment of the crisis and the operational need to continue to provide such assistance. </p>  <p>  The question of a further deployment to the operation in the Mediterranean next year will be evaluated over the coming months and will be considered in the context of the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response thereto, the demands on the Defence Forces, our overseas commitments and available resources.</p></reply>

The Irish contingent comprising 197 personnel is based primarily in Camp 2-45 as part of a joint battalion with Finland.  The decision by Government to send troops overseas is never taken lightly.  The safety of all Irish Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions is always a concern to me, my Government colleagues and to the military authorities.  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of mission specific training.  Such training, which is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of increased threat, has been designed to allow Defence Forces personnel to carry out their tasks and to provide for their protection. </p>  <p>  Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment to carry out their mission.  This equipment enables troops to fulfill the roles assigned to them, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission.  In addition to training and equipment, ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and both equipment and force assets are continually reviewed to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfill their roles. </p>  <p>  The reality is that no peacekeeping mission is without danger. I am confident, however that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel currently serving overseas.  I am advised by the Defence Forces that Commanders in the mission, at all levels, liaise with the Host Nation, the Lebanese Armed Forces and local stakeholders to ensure that all aspects of the mission, including Freedom of Movement, are achievable.</p></reply>

Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.</p><p>The social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners who have been less attached to the workforce.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, may allow up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p><p>Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a <i>means-tested</i>State pension (non-contributory), which amounts to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p><p>The difference between the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory) and the maximum rate of the State pension (non-contributory) is &euro;11.30, therefore if the State pension is the only source of income, it would not generally be reduced by &euro;45 unless the person concerned had other means, and/or they have not made a claim for the non-contributory pension.If a person is in receipt of a contributory pension reduced by &euro;45 and they have no other means, they should contact my Department with a view to making a claim for the State pension (non-contributory).</p><p>Work is under way to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the number of contributions recorded over a working life.  It is expected that this will replace the current system for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.</p></reply>

This programme has led to the re-structuring of CE childcare provision which will improve the career path for participants who wish to pursue a career in childcare.  These improvements provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community childcare.  The FETAC Major 5 Award is the entry level requirement to work as a basic practitioner in childcare. </p>  <p>  From the Department&rsquo;s perspective, the status of a CE participant attached to a community childcare centre is, in the first instance, that of a jobseeker seeking a qualification in early childhood education.  CE participants are not deemed to be qualified staff but learners in childcare settings. </p></reply>

JobPath was designed following an open consultation process (a number of open fora were attended by a wide range of participants), with input from labour market experts in Ireland and abroad and taking account of international experience.  The Department was also advised by the Centre for Social and Economic Inclusion in the design of JobPath.</p>  <p>  Participants on JobPath will receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding jobs.  They are also provided with a range of training and development supports including online modules, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills and where a need is identified, a client may be referred for further education and training opportunities provided by ETBs and others.  These training and development supports may be accredited by FETAC or lead to an industry recognised certification.</p>  <p>  JobPath providers are paid based on outcomes &ndash; they receive a fee for each thirteen week period of full time employment (30 hours per week) secured for a client.  The fee is paid in arrears and a maximum of four fees are paid (i.e. 12 months employment).  This fee structure ensures that the providers are incentivised to find sustained employment for JobPath clients and to work with JobPath clients to help them transition into, and remain in, employment.</p>  <p>  Participants are selected by the Department &ndash; the companies have no say in the selection process.  Jobseekers will spend a year on JobPath and if they are placed into a job they will continue to receive support from a Personal Advisor for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.  Should a client lose a job while on JobPath, their Personal Advisor will continue to work with them to help them obtain further employment and the department&rsquo;s Intreo Centres will expedite payment of their welfare entitlements. </p>  <p>  JobPath is one of a range of activation supports, including schemes such as CE and T&Uacute;S, catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers.  In general, and JobPath is not an exception, it is not possible for clients to participate in two separate schemes at the same time.  In addition, given the need to manage the allocation of places effectively, the Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another scheme.  This approach is particularly relevant in the case of JobPath whereby providers are paid on the basis of outcomes; it is important that the service providers have the opportunity and the time to achieve the outcome &ndash; which is to help the jobseeker secure and sustain full-time employment.  On completion of JobPath, participation in other schemes and programmes remains an option that will be assessed by the Department&rsquo;s case officers.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that all decisions regarding a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements while on JobPath will be taken only by Department officials and not by the JobPath companies.  In addition the process for sanctioning clients, who do not engage with the JobPath activation process, is exactly the same as the process for clients who fail to engage with any of the Department&rsquo;s other activation programmes.  Again this process is operated by the Department&rsquo;s own staff and not by the JobPath providers.</p>  <p>  Significant safeguards have been built into JobPath.  These include a service guarantee to ensure that all participants receive a baseline level of service as well as penalties for the companies if service performance or service quality does not meet set standards.  JobPath is also structured such that the companies cannot recover their costs or make any profit unless and until they get people into sustainable jobs.  The rates paid to contractors are also linked to performance in the wider economy.  Automatic discounts apply if employment growth exceeds our medium term forecasts.  In addition, both companies will be subject to regular on-site inspections and audits to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations.  Payments are also subject to the results of independent customer satisfaction surveys that will be commissioned by the Department.</p>  <p>  Seetec was accused of fraudulent activity by former staff members in 2013.  This alleged fraud related to claims that Seetec inflated employment outcomes for people with disabilities under the 'Work Choices' programme in the UK.  The DWP has publicly refuted these claims and advised the UK&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee that it has investigated the claims and found no wrongdoing.  The potential for inflating figures has been taken into consideration in the design of JobPath.  The Department is satisfied that artificial inflation of employment outcomes will be controlled in Ireland though the use of data matching with Revenue Commencement of Employment records and the Department&rsquo;s own welfare payment systems. </p>  <p>  Turas Nua is a new joint venture between FRS recruitment, based in Roscrea, and Working Links, a not for profit UK service provider.  It has been acknowledged by Working Links that some members of its staff incorrectly recorded employment and training placement for jobseekers under the 'New Deal', the precursor programme in the UK to the Work Programme.  However the DWP has publicly stated that the errors occurred in 2008 as a consequence of its heavy reliance on paper-based transactions and that it is satisfied that these cases were investigated thoroughly by Working Links (the amount involved represented less than 0.05% of the payments at the time) and that appropriate actions were taken, with the associated amounts being repaid.  DWP has subsequently awarded additional contracts to Working Links. </p>  <p>  It is important to note, that neither of the above companies has been sanctioned by the DWP for any fraudulent activity.</p>  <p>  JobPath is being rolled out in offices across the country and is expected to be fully implemented in the first quarter of 2016.  The cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of jobseekers who are referred and the number who secure sustainable employment.  Finally, Turas Nua has confirmed that the questions asked of clients regarding criminality are in the process of being removed from their diagnostic assessment.</p></reply>

The cost of increasing SPNC by an additional &euro;6 to &euro;228 per week is &euro;30.1 million in a full year, including proportional increases for qualified adults.</p>  <p>  The maximum personal rate of the State Pension Contributory (SPC) is also increasing by &euro;3 in January 2016, from &euro;230.30 per week to &euro;233.30 per week.  The cost of increasing SPC by a further &euro;11.70 is &euro;249.4 million in a full year (including proportional increases for qualified adults, and for those on reduced rates).</p>  <p>  One of the aims of the social welfare Budget package for 2016 was to increase supports for pensioners aged 66 and over.  More than 676,500 pensioners and their dependents will benefit from the &euro;3 increase in the weekly rate of payments to all social welfare recipients aged 66 and over.  This is the first weekly rate increase for pensioners since 2009 and builds on the increase in the Living Alone Allowance last year.  This is the first general rate increase for pensioners since 2009.</p>  <p>  I was also pleased to reintroduce a Christmas Bonus payable at 25% of the weekly rate last year.  This year I am in a position to provide a 75% Christmas Bonus payment for all welfare recipients, including pensioners.  For example, in the case of a pensioner couple, both in receipt of the non-contributory State Pension, it will mean a bonus payment of &euro;328.50. </p>  <p>  In addition, pensioners eligible for the Fuel Allowance will gain from the increase in January of &euro;2.50 per week, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week over the fuel season.</p>  <p>  Funding for the Free Travel scheme, which benefits a large number of pensioners, is being increased by &euro;3m, from &euro;77m to &euro;80m, to meet increased numbers eligible for the scheme and therefore fully protect entitlements under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Finally, pensioners who have income over and above their social welfare pension may also benefit from the USC changes introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;3 million was allocated to the programme as part of Budget 2016, bringing the total allocation to &euro;42 million in 2016. </p><p>There are two schemes operated under the school meals programme. The first scheme is the urban school meals scheme which is operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department. The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects. There were over 1,390 schools, preschools and other groups participating in the school meals local projects scheme in the academic year 2014/2015 and a county breakdown is provided in the tabular statement below.  </p><p>The aim of the scheme is to provide regular nutritious food to children who are unable, by reason of lack of food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them. Applicants to the scheme are directed to the Department&rsquo;s website which states that funding is for healthy nutritious food only and examples of food items are provided. Applicants are informed that information regarding healthy eating for children is also available from the Health Promotion Unit of the Health Services Executive and in &lsquo;A Good Practice Guide for School Food Initiative&rsquo; produced by the organisation Healthy Food for All. </p><p>Schools/groups must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of each school year. Any expenditure on non-food items and unhealthy foods is deducted from the following year&rsquo;s allocation. </p><p>In addition, the Department initiated an inspection programme in 2012 consisting of on-site inspections in participating schools to ensure that the scheme rules are being adhered to. This inspection process will be rolled out to all schools over the next 3 year period and the Department has assigned additional resources to facilitate this work. </p><p><b>Tabular Statement: Breakdown of schools and preschools by county in the school meals local projects scheme</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>No. of schools &amp;amp; preschools</th></tr><tr><td>Co Carlow</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Co Cavan</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Co Clare</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Co Cork</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>Co Donegal</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Co Dublin</td><td>344</td></tr><tr><td>Co Galway</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Co Kerry</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Co Kildare</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Co Kilkenny</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Co Laois</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Co Leitrim</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Co Limerick</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Co Longford</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Co Louth</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Co Mayo</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>Co Meath</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Co Monaghan</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>Co Offaly</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Co Roscommon</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Co Sligo</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Co Tipperary</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Co Waterford</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Co Westmeath</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Co Wexford</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Co Wicklow</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>1,394</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Class A employees with weekly earnings of &euro;352.01 or more make a 4% contribution charged on all of their earnings.  This creates a "step effect" as net income reduces immediately by the full 4% PRSI charge applied to all earnings. </p>  <p>  From 1 January 2016 a new PRSI Credit is being introduced and will reduce the amount of PRSI paid for those with weekly gross earnings between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424. The maximum weekly PRSI Credit of &euro;12 applies at weekly earnings of &euro;352.01.  This will reduce the current weekly PRSI charge from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08 at this level of earnings.  Where weekly earnings exceed &euro;352.01 and are less than &euro;424.01 per week, the maximum weekly PRSI Credit applying is reduced on a tapered basis.  The new arrangements will ensure that all employees earning between &euro;352 and &euro;424 per week will pay less PRSI each week, effective from January next and the employee will always be better off as earnings increase. </p>  <p>  Increasing the threshold to &euro;377 with a &euro;12 credit tapering as suggested would cost an additional &euro;13.3 million in a full year (over and above the cost of the measure announced in the Budget) and affect 112,646 employments.</p></reply>

Over 17,200 rent supplement tenancies have been awarded this year showing that landlords are accommodating significant numbers under the scheme. </p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the findings of the recent Daft.ie rental report and the difficulties that people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market, including in the South East region.</p>  <p>  A review of the rent limits undertaken earlier this year found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients. </p>  <p>  Rather than increasing limits at this time, rent supplement policy will continue to allow for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of current limits.  Flexibility is provided under the National Framework for Tenancy Sustainment for both existing customers of the scheme and new applicants.  Under this measure, the circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  This flexible approach has already assisted over 5,000 households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation, including over 20 households in receipt of rent supplement in Waterford.  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), administered by the local authorities, has been rolled out in Waterford city and county since September 2014 and there are currently over 610 HAP tenancies in place.  Of the 610 cases, approximately 390 are new customers and the remaining 220 represent households with long term housing needs that have transferred from rent supplement.</p>  <p>  I believe that these measures and the recently announced reforms to the private rental sector, will provide increased certainty for both tenants and landlords in the current market.  I am continuing to keep this matter under close review. </p></reply>

In its role of supporting the sustainable and prudent development of the sector, the Central Bank wants to ensure that proposed changes to the business model are prudently structured and implemented.  Given a number of areas identified in feedback received on CP88 and through other engagements with sector stakeholders the Central Bank will engage with interested parties to participate in focused dialogue in the coming months.

When the work has been completed, the individual must contact the local authority again confirming the exact cost of the works and requesting the local authority to issue a letter of certification.  It is only when the person receives the letter of certification that they will then be able to claim the tax relief.  Copies of these letters of certification will be forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners in order to collate data.  Therefore, it is only when Revenue has received letters of certification that they will be able to determine the numbers approved under the scheme. </p></reply>

The Commission presented its Report on 31 March 2012 and over 60 of those recommendations are contained in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 (the "2012 Act"). </p>  <p>  The purpose of the International Credit Union Regulators' Network ("ICURN") review was to assess the performance of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in relation to credit unions.  The review assessed the legal, regulatory and prudential supervisory framework in place to fulfil the Central Bank's mandate under section 84 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and accordingly focused on the legal and regulatory framework for the regulation of credit unions in effect at the time of the review.  Overall the review found that the Central Bank effectively performs its functions in the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector.</p>  <p>  ICURN made a number of recommendations to the Central Bank under various headings outlining specific refinements.  I am aware of the suggestion made by ICURN under the heading Communications and Guidance that consideration be given by the relevant authority to directing a closely-defined, limited review to evaluate the implementation of the original recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  ICURN acknowledges that this is not a matter for the Central Bank and suggests that such a review could be carried out by the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC).  I am currently considering this suggestion.</p>  <p>  The 2012 Act was signed into law by the President in December 2012.  It was agreed at that time that it would be neither practical nor feasible to commence the 2012 Act in its entirety in one fell swoop.  Following on from that, an implementation timetable for the 2012 Act was devised in consultation with stakeholders, including credit union representative bodies. </p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner.  This has provided credit unions with the time necessary to ensure that the required processes and procedures are in place prior to implementation of each tranche.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the perceived impact of the new regulations being highlighted by the credit union sector as I have met with the three credit union representative bodies and this issue was discussed.  It is my intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions. </p>  <p>  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. </p></reply>

AIB have confirmed to my Department that there has been no change in its policy with regard to sitting tenants in Buy-To-Let (BTL) properties. The bank considers each case based on its specific circumstances. If there is a formal lease in place, then the bank will honour the terms of that formal lease. However where the tenant of the property is in breach of the terms of their lease, the Receivers may seek to terminate the lease in accordance with the PRTB (Private Residential Tenancies Board) rules and regulations. Where there is no formal lease in place, then the bank may seek vacant possession of the BTL property. In such cases, the bank or receiver will seek to ascertain the length of occupation and will afford the tenant the appropriate notice period in accordance with the PRTB rules and regulations.Therefore, in fulfilling its fiduciary obligation to obtain the best return it can from the disposal of the asset, the bank or receiver may in some, but not all, circumstances require to seek vacant possession of the property.

This extension of the childcare and education exemption removed an anomaly that existed whereby those that provided childcare and education on a charitable basis were exempt from rates but those that did so on a not-for-profit basis were not. </p>  <p>  The Valuation Office is in the process of updating valuation lists to give effect to this extension of the exemption so that it will be effective for qualifying providers in 2016. The Valuation Office's interpretation of paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 means that those that only provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme are also exempt from rates.</p>  <p>  The decision taken by Government to extend the exemption from rates for early childcare and education was taken having considered the views of stakeholders in the sector. As outlined in the Seanad, and subsequently in the D&aacute;il, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that is a significant source of funding for Local Authorities. One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable. </p></reply>

This information reflects difficult decisions required at the time under the Moratorium, which of course was an emergency policy response to a crisis in the public finances, caused by a fiscal and economic crisis.  The reductions to public service numbers and public service pay rates, which were agreed with the public service unions, have made a vital contribution to the recovery of the public finances and should be valued as a key part in the broader recovery in the economy. What will not be clear from a narrow focus on requests and decisions around exemptions is the impact of the public service reform agenda on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of public services against the backdrop of reducing resources. The additional hours, changes to work practices and initiatives such shared services are an important part of a more rounded assessment of public service needs, performance and service levels as the country emerges from what has been a very difficult period.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-24a.335.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015112400064#WRF06000"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s improving competitiveness performance since 2011 has been central to securing the recovery in economic growth and employment. Improved competitiveness has made Irish firms more cost competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in. The recovery in jobs to date, with 135,800 more employed than at the beginning of 2012, unemployment down from over 15% in 2012 to 8.9% in October and the record levels of indigenous exports being achieved, is in large part due to the considerable improvements in the business environment for enterprises. Overall, Ireland has moved from 25th to 16th on the IMD Competitiveness rankings, with progress being made in areas such as the environment for start-ups, regulation, and access to credit.Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness is a key economic priority for Government. Since 2012, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs has set out a comprehensive set of measures to improve our competitiveness performance. We continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness and take appropriate action to address fragilities as they emerge. The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 requires the National Competitiveness Council to &ldquo;Benchmark key business costs and publish a report highlighting areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors&rdquo;. The Council's 2015 Costs of Doing Business in Ireland report benchmarks key business costs across over fifty indicators and focuses on areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors, and on costs that are largely domestically determined. </p><p>The NCC's 2015 report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, energy, water, waste, communications and business services. The report finds that while relative cost competitiveness is improving (i.e. although costs are increasing, they are increasing at a slower rate than in many of our competitors), this improvement is largely being driven by external factors beyond the control of domestic policymakers. In particular, a weak euro exchange rate, low ECB interest rates, and low international fuel prices have all combined to improve Irish cost competitiveness. The NCC report concludes that Ireland&rsquo;s industrial cost base has improved but pressure points are emerging in labour, property and business service costs. </p><p>We will continue to take corrective action where particular issues emerge. As an island nation for whom competitive transport services are essential to getting our products to market, as part of Budget 2016 the Minister for Finance announced plans to simplify the rates of commercial motor tax by replacing the existing 20 rates with just five rates ranging from &euro;92 to &euro;900, with effect from January 1, 2016. The changes are set to benefit operators of about 28,500 commercial vehicles and address anomalies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the regime in the UK and Northern Ireland.</p><p>Now is not the time to be complacent about our competitiveness as we have further progress to make if we are to achieve the ambition in the Government's recent enterprise policy statement Enterprise 2025 of achieving sustainable full employment. We must maintain an intense focus on reducing costs that are out of line with those in competitor countries. There is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness. Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are essential. Improving productivity performance is also key.</p><p>The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be published before year-end. </p></reply>

There are 12 IDA Ireland client companies, employing 1,874 people.  IDA Ireland-supported companies in Kerry brought 361 additional new jobs to the county between 2011&ndash;2014.  This is a marked increase on the period 2008&ndash;2010 when 502 jobs were lost.  70% of all new IDA Ireland jobs come from existing client companies, so it is imperative that we ensure that the local supports are provided to maintain these companies&rsquo; presence in Ireland.  IDA Ireland launched its new five-year strategy entitled <i>Winning &ndash; Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019</i>in April 2015.  This strategy has a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations.  To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period.</p><p>This programme will also include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.  Tralee is to be the site of one such advanced technology building.</p><p>Marketing of any regional area, including Kerry, for FDI is done through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland although the ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>by the companies themselves.</p><p>The reinstatement of Regional Aid for Co. Kerry under the new Regional Aid Guidelines, which came into force on 1<sup>st</sup>July, 2014, is a further boost to the county.  The RAGs enable the State to grant State Aid to businesses at enhanced rates in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions.  The funding for this comes from the Exchequer.  This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are available in Kerry.</p><p>In July 2015, IDA Ireland with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation launched the <i>South West Regional Action Plan for Jobs</i>, which highlights working with the other agencies and local stakeholders to improve enterprise development and identify job creation opportunities at regional level.  IDA Ireland engages particularly with Enterprise Ireland regarding the supply chain that can be in a position to encourage and support Foreign Direct Investment.</p><p>It is important to recognise that only 8% of employment is in IDA supported companies nationally.  The Action Plan for Jobs and the Regional Action Plans are committed to developing an indigenous engine of growth.  In the period 2011-2014 Enterprise Ireland supported companies created an extra 370 jobs in Kerry (9% increase), while companies supported by the Kerry LEO added 85 new jobs in 2014 (5% increase).</p></reply>

Since we took office, multinational companies have added more than 18,000 direct jobs in Ireland, which has had a significant knock-on effect on employment across the country.  Our aim is to deepen and broaden that impact even further to create and maintain even more jobs.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  American </font>investment is crucial to Ireland&rsquo;s economic success.  The US<font color="#2F2F2F"> is the greatest source of FDI in Ireland, accounting for over 70% of all FDI currently in Ireland.</font>Approximately 630 corporations employ 125,000 directly in a broad range of sectors such as information technology, biopharma, medical technology and financial services.  Ireland is the number one export platform for US companies.  IDA Ireland client companies export 60% of everything they produce to other European countries.  It is as a result of all of this that US companies contribute greatly to the strategic regional focus of IDA Ireland.</p><p>I visited the East Coast of the US (New York and Boston) on a trade mission from Monday 26<sup>th</sup>October to Friday 30<sup>th</sup>October 2015 and was accompanied by the CEO of IDA Ireland, Mr. Martin Shanahan.</p><p>My schedule included twelve individual meetings with IDA Ireland-client companies in the New York and Boston area.  These meetings provided me with an opportunity to engage directly with companies promoting Ireland as a location for investment across a wide range of fields, from research and development to manufacturing to business services.  Meetings took place with CEOs and executives at senior level in both existing and key target clients.</p><p>I also attended two breakfast meetings organised by IDA Ireland, which were attended by clients from the emerging, technology, financial services and life science sectors.</p><p>Ireland scores highly in global business rankings and continues to attract companies from a variety of sectors including ICT, life sciences, financial services, engineering, digital media, games and social media. Ireland has a rich history of achievements in Science &amp;amp; Technology and continues to invest in its research and technology capabilities.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s success in attracting foreign direct investment requires a clear focus on improving and enhancing the national competitive environment, easing the impediments to business investment and encouraging job creation.  Targeting of specific growth sectors and business models, increased competitiveness and an improved international reputation are key factors that contributed to the strong results in recent years, all of which must be maintained in the future.</p></reply>

The Agency is aware of privately owned industrial space on the estate and has assured me that it will promote this land as part of its marketing efforts, in response to specific client queries and also where the opportunities arise for the purpose of winning FDI projects for the county.  There are a number of vacant large scale industrial units in the nearby Clonshaugh Business and Technology Park, and IDA Ireland continues to market these as part of its overall value proposition for Dublin.</p>  <p>  According to the 2014 Annual Employment Survey there are 596 IDA client companies employing in total 70,989 people located in the greater Dublin area.

As part of this strategy up to &euro;100 million in Enterprise Ireland funding will be made available over 5 years through a series of competitive calls.  Funding will be allocated on a competitive basis, with most funds awarded to regional projects offering the best prospects for job-creation.  A first tranche of &euro;50 million will be made available in the period 2015 &ndash; 2017.  Within the &euro;50m there are 3 initiatives -</p><p>1. a &euro;5m Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Competitive Call ( launched in May 2015), to fund initiatives impacting on and supporting micro-enterprise throughout the country.</p><p>2. a &euro;5m Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme (launched in May 2015), to support collaborative proposals to promote entrepreneurship, create jobs, foster innovation and enhance export opportunities for small business.</p><p>3. funding under a third broader competitive regional call (2015 -2017) of up to &euro;40 million to support significant projects or initiatives to improve or leverage identified enterprise capability in the region: Such projects will be:</p><p>- Industry-driven project/s that leverage identified regional strengths and sectoral opportunities.</p><p>- Collaborative in nature, involving key stakeholders (private-private/public-private) in a region or across more than one region.  The collaboration may take the form of &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; and &ldquo;enterprise hubs&rdquo;, a further deepening of SME-Higher Education Sector engagement in regions, and/or formal structures and teams to drive collaborative projects.</p><p>- Able to demonstrate clear benefits to the enterprise base and the region/s (for example, increased design-led innovation, enterprise capability, procurement and supply chain opportunities, start-up activity, etc).</p><p>To inform the scoping of the third broad competitive regional funding call of &euro;40m, Enterprise Ireland launched a <i>Call for Expression of Ideas for Regional Initiatives</i>in July 2015, to help identify potential areas of enterprise and sectoral opportunities in regions across the country.  The submissions received are being used to shape appropriate interventions and schemes that are aimed at driving the objectives I outlined in February 2015 and to identify gaps where no existing funding interventions exists from local or national public bodies.</p><p>It is important to state that submitted ideas under this call does not confer any advantage on subsequent funding applications to Enterprise Ireland nor does it in any way indicate an intention by Enterprise Ireland to make a financial commitment.</p><p>All 3 initiatives listed above are work in progress.  The submissions are currently being assessed and evaluated and a number of projects require clarification on areas such as policy, project costings, impact on job creation, duplication with other initiatives etc.  No final decisions have been made on any allocation of funding to applicants.

The stated aim of negotiations on investment is to secure the highest levels of liberalisation and highest standards of protection that both sides have negotiated to date.  The mandate makes it clear that the inclusion of investment protection will depend on EU interests being met and on the final balance of the Agreement.  Importantly, the mandate states that the objectives of any investment protection provisions would be without prejudice to the right of EU and the Member States to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives in a non-discriminatory manner.</p><p>The aim is to promote more two-way investment between the US and EU with high standards of protection for investors.  The EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements seek to provide EU investors abroad with a level of protection similar to that which would obtain in the EU.  Equally US investors in the EU expect common investment protection standards and common redress mechanisms, and not 28 different set of standards and 28 different redress procedures.</p><p>Ireland does not have Bilateral Investment Treaties with any third country.  In Ireland, private property is protected by virtue of Article 43 of our Constitution.  However, in some other EU member states the protection for foreign investors from expropriation is provided through Bilateral Investment Treaties with third countries.  Nine member states have such Treaties already with the US.  An EU-US Trade Agreement would replace these.</p><p>On the 8<sup>th</sup>July 2015 the European Parliament voted for a resolution supporting the EU-US Trade Agreement including a reformed investment protection mechanism.</p><p>On the 12th November 2015, the EU Commission published and formally presented to the US its proposal for a new and more transparent system for resolving disputes between investors and states &ndash; the Investment Court System.  This proposal is the outcome of a lengthy public consultation process with the Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and the public.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal aims at safeguarding Government&rsquo;s right to regulate and creates a new system composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings.  The proposal also includes additional improvements on access to the new system by small and medium sized companies.  The new investment court system would replace the existing investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism.  The proposal is available on the Commission&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>I welcome these improvements and the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to follow up on the views expressed by Member States, the European Parliament and other stakeholders.</p></reply>

Export performance is driven by many factors, including the prevailing economic conditions of our key trading partners, and recent years have seen a globally challenging environment for our indigenous exporters.  Nevertheless, the latest available data shows exports of Irish goods and services to the value of &euro;215 billion in 2014, up from &euro;184 billion in 2013.  Our strong growth in goods and services exports are being driven by sectors which we have specifically targeted as part of the Action Plan for Jobs, including the pharma and manufacturing areas.  Indigenous firms are becoming more export focused with the share of sales that arise from exports on an upward trend, reaching 51% in 2014.</p>  <p>  In 2011, EI client exports achieved &euro;15.2bn.  This exceeded the pre-recession record levels of 2008.  In 2012, EI client exports achieved &euro;16.2bn with North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America in particular recording strong double digit growth.  This performance was against a backdrop of continued international uncertainty and low global growth rates.  In 2013, EI client exports achieved &euro;17.1bn with Northern Europe, North and Latin America showing strong growth.  This record growth was against increasing global competition and illustrates the quality and innovativeness of Irish products and services.</p>  <p>  In 2014, EI supported Irish exporters again achieved record exports of &euro;18.6bn &ndash; an increase of almost 10% on 2013 figures &ndash; and the highest point in the history of the State.  Growth was recorded in exports to all international regions and across all sectors.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has a number of supports and initiatives in place to assist exporting companies.  These include the Growth Fund, Potential Exporters, First Sale Programme, the International Selling Programme and sector specific Trade Missions.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) through its programmes and overseas office network will target support for clients to achieve &euro;22 billion in exports by 2016.</p>  <p>  The LEOs also provide support to companies that are undertaking market research, feasibility studies or who are participating in trade fairs.  Other LEO initiatives to drive export activity include the Food Academy Programme, for up-and-coming food producers (in association with Bord Bia and SuperValu) and Online Trading vouchers (in partnership with the Dept. of Communications, Energy and National Resources) to support startup and smaller businesses operating in the domestic economy to access a wider market through online trading.  Taken together, the National Broadband Plan and the National Digital Strategy will assist and incentivise greater use of online trading to drive exports.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Small Business Act (SBA) Factsheet for 2015 was published this month by the European Commission.  This report shows that Ireland has one of the most SME friendly environments in the EU.  Of the 10 principles contained in this policy initiative, Ireland performs above the EU average in 6 and is top of the class in two, &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; and &ldquo;internationalisation&rdquo;.  Ireland&rsquo;s improvement in internationalisation has been at a much faster rate than in the EU on average.</p>  <p>  The Review of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, 2010 &ndash; 2015, published in February 2014, developed a focus on key sectors of competitive advantage for Ireland in line with the Action Plan for Jobs.  This Review provides a refocused action plan under three key themes &ndash; reputation, facilitating &amp;amp; enabling and winning business &amp;amp; jobs.  In 2016, we will develop a successor to the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Winning Abroad initiative under the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 has facilitated greater coordination of Embassies and State agencies abroad, ensuring that we maximise the impact of State resources in priority markets, giving them and Irish companies the best possible platform to win business overseas.</p></reply>

In 2008 the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government estimated the value of pollinators (including honey bees) for Irish food crops was worth at least &euro;53m.  This does not include the value of pollinators in terms of non-food crops and maintaining bio-diversity in the wild.  The value of honey produced in Ireland in 2014 was estimated at slightly over &euro;3m.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population.  I fully recognise that a disease outbreak and especially an exotic disease outbreak, could have a significant negative impact on the Irish Bee population.  With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act. American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No 110 of 2014).  While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland.  In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year.  This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society.  Volunteer beekeepers in areas which are considered to represent greatest risk for the introduction of pests such as the Small Hive Beetle, as well as other beekeepers are participating in this programme.  Over 20 beekeepers providing a representative geographical spread across the country are involved.  A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland.  The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland.  My Department co-ordinates the programme and has provided the equipment and guidelines to the beekeepers and also provides the diagnostic service to implement the programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow.  Analysis of approximately 300 samples submitted by beekeepers each year are carried out and my Department is informed where a case of a notifiable disease is detected.  Officials in my Department follow up where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The option of national action to limit or ban imports of bees must respect the primacy of EU Regulations.  The EU has strict bee health certification requirements which apply to the international trade in bees.  In accordance with Article 3 of Council Directive 92/65/EEC European Union Member States must not prohibit or restrict for health reasons the international movement of bees once all requirements set down in EU legislation have been met.  Direct imports of bees into Ireland from outside the EU are not permitted although imports from other EU Member States which fulfil the EU&rsquo;s bee health certification requirements are permitted.</p></reply>

However, all the Centres have unique features which facilitate a broad range of other diverse activities which are important from both an economic and social perspective.    Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is no exception to this diversity, while first and foremost a working fishery harbour, my Department is conscious that it is also a very important tourist destination in addition to being a major venue for leisure activities with a wide range of recreational users of the harbour, including the yacht club, sport fishermen, walkers, tourists and other social users. These activities generate large volumes of vehicular traffic to the harbour. </p>  <p>  Traffic Management is one of the areas where my Department has made investments to improve the safety of those visiting the harbour. Under my Departments 2015 Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development programme I have allocated &euro;115,000 in two tranches for these purposes, &euro;75,000 in March and a further &euro;40,000 in July. Areas attracting these funds include bollards, kerbing, footpath realignment and road lining. These monies augment funds allocated in previous years for the ongoing safety improvements at the harbour.   </p>  <p>  In matters concerning traffic management and road safety, my Department works closely with Fingal County Council and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In view of the high level of harbour traffic in Howth Fishery Harbour Centre and of health and safety concerns, a firm of consulting engineers examined the overall traffic management which considered traffic calming and pedestrian movements. The consultants conducted a Road Safety Audit and amongst the recommendations was a roundabout at the West Pier car park exit which is currently an unregulated junction. </p>  <p>A planning application to introduce traffic management measures, including the roundabout at the West Pier car park exit, was submitted to Fingal County Council. On the 23 September last my Department received a Notification of Decision to Grant Permission for a new roundabout and associated work at the West Pier car park exit.   </p>  <p>  The decision to grant was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 21 October and the Department must now await the outcome of this process before proceeding any further.</p></reply>

Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is a working fishery harbour, however it is also a very important tourist and leisure destination with many restaurants and businesses operating on the Harbour. </p>  <p>  The question of the introduction of paid car parking on Howth Harbour   , as part of an overall review of traffic management arrangements, remains under consideration. </p>  <p>  The Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General in his Special Report (No 82 of July 2014) and the related Report of the Public Accounts Committee of 24 June 2015 have asked the Department to review the position re pay parking in Howth, in conjunction with other Fishery Harbour Centres with a view to increasing income generation possibilities.   </p>  <p>  However, income generation is not the only factor to be considered in deciding whether pay parking should be introduced in Howth, there is a broad range of other factors to be taken into account before a final decision will be made on the matter. Most importantly, the safe operation of the Harbour is of paramount concern, in this context, traffic management and parking is recognised as an issue, particularly, though not exclusively, during the busy holiday periods.   </p>  <p>  Traffic and parking management within the Fishery Harbour Centre itself has been an issue for some time, particularly in the light of concerns raised about safety and emergency access by the Coastguard, the Lifeboat service, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this regard, upgrading works to the car park, including lining of parking spaces, have taken place as part of the harbour&rsquo;s new traffic management scheme. In 2015 I have allocated &euro;115,000 for the continuation of these improvements.</p></reply>

While first and foremost a working fishery harbour, Howth similar to the other five Fishery Harbour Centres, has its own unique features and is home to a broad range of diverse economic and social activities.  My Department is conscious of the importance of both fishing and non fishing activities in Howth and endeavours to facilitate and develop both.  This involves day to day operational support by Harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure subject to available financial resources. </p>  <p>  I am happy to advise the Deputy that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of &euro;4.2 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth FHC as part of my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2011 to 2014. </p>  <p>  For 2015, I approved funding of &euro;1.79 million for the maintenance and development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.  Major works for 2015 include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of a small craft pontoon and traffic management works.</p>  <p>  Supporting the needs of the fishing industry and those of the wider range of harbour users, while continuing to deliver on a public service remit, will be foremost when considering future developments in the harbour.  As with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, future projects at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre will be considered under the Capital Programme on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing National priorities.</p></reply>

This access built on previous arrangements for fisheries products and has more recently been part of wider trade missions to expand the access for Irish food and seafood products in China. In the specific case of live crab, I understand from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority that there has been a steady increase in exports most recently estimated at &euro;3 million in value with a significant number of Irish sea-fishing boats providing this product to up to 8 seafood export companies.   On 29 October 2015, the Chinese food import authorities wrote to the Irish embassy in Beijing expressing concern about the levels of the heavy metal cadmium in live crabs coming from Ireland which the authorities determined exceeded Chinese limits and requested that Ireland ensure only crabs which meet the Chinese standards for cadmium be permitted for export. I am advised that the UK is currently experiencing similar challenges.</p>  <p>  European legislation sets a limit of 0.5 mg/kg for white muscle meat from the limbs only; however the Chinese authorities are currently applying this limit to all crabmeat. I understand that crabs take in cadmium from the environment and it builds up in the brown meat of the crab to much higher levels than the white meat. In view of the Chinese request to meet this standard for live crabs, the SFPA notified Irish crab exporters of the new monitoring requirements and the difficulties this would pose for providing health certificates for live Irish crabs intended for export to China.</p>  <p>  As part of efforts to support the trade of compliant safe seafood, a Memorandum of Understanding is in place with the Chinese import authorities which allows for technical dialogue. With the support of the Marine Institute and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the SFPA has sought to raise this issue with the Chinese authorities in recent weeks. The SFPA is leading on a technical response to the communication from the Chinese authorities before the end of November with a view to meaningful dialogue around reconsideration of the tissues to which this limit applies. To date, there have been two meetings with representatives of the crab industry to facilitate exploration of a range of approaches which may be adopted to address this challenge.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Marine Institute, that Irish waters have very low cadmium levels. It is important to bear in mind that heavy metals occur naturally at low levels in the marine environment and as such do not pose a food safety risk. I am satisfied that the procedures which are in place for monitoring the safety of Irish seafood, including live crab, meet the stringent European standards and consumers can continue to have high confidence in the quality of Irish seafood.</p></reply>

The fisheries subject to this requirement includes pelagic fisheries.    The regulation does not require that every vessel carries an observer and the regulation puts the obligation on the Flag Member State to design and implement the scheme rather than the vessel or the coastal state in whose waters the fishing takes place. It is a matter of competence for the Flag Member State of the vessel concerned to ensure that observers are onboard where required under their national scheme.

In addition to the TACs and quotas set down each year by the Fisheries Council, under the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), a Member State may also swap (exchange) quotas with other Member States in a particular year.  Details of fishing opportunities available to Member States in EU waters in recent years are available on the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries DG website, using the following link:</p><p>One of the key elements of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches.  The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1 January 2015.  The EU Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393/2014 on 20 October 2014 which implements a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in north-western waters in line with the recommendation of the North West Waters Member States Group.  A Control Experts Group from the North West Waters Regional Group of Member States has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries.  These draft recommendations have been sent to the Pelagic Advisory Council and the North Western Advisory Council in accordance with article 18 of the CFP basic regulation (EU No 1380/2013) for their observations.  When these are received, the draft recommendations will be considered by the NWW Member States Group. </p><p>Control of the vessel within Ireland's Exclusive Fisheries Zone is a matter for the Irish control authorities.  The Control authorities monitor fishing activity of all vessels operating in Ireland's Exclusive Fisheries Zone.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, operational issues concerning sea fisheries control are a matter for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. </p></reply>

This access built on previous arrangements for fisheries products and has more recently been part of wider trade missions to expand the access for Irish food and seafood products in China. In the specific case of live crab, I understand from the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority that there has been a steady increase in exports most recently estimated at &euro;3 million in value with a significant number of Irish sea-fishing boats providing this product to up to 8 seafood export companies.</p>  <p>  On 29 October 2015, the Chinese food import authorities wrote to the Irish embassy in Beijing expressing concern about the levels of the heavy metal cadmium in live crabs coming from Ireland which the authorities determined exceeded Chinese limits and requested that Ireland ensure only crabs which meet the Chinese standards for cadmium be permitted for export. I am advised that the UK is currently experiencing similar challenges. </p>  <p>  European legislation sets a limit of 0.5 mg/kg for white muscle meat from the limbs only; however the Chinese authorities are currently applying this limit to all crabmeat. I understand that crabs take in cadmium from the environment and it builds up in the brown meat of the crab to much higher levels than the white meat. In view of the Chinese request to meet this standard for live crabs, the SFPA notified Irish crab exporters of the new monitoring requirements and the difficulties this would pose for providing health certificates for live Irish crabs intended for export to China.</p>  <p>  As part of efforts to support the trade of compliant safe seafood, a Memorandum of Understanding is in place with the Chinese import authorities which allows for technical dialogue. With the support of the Marine Institute and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the SFPA has sought to raise this issue with the Chinese authorities in recent weeks. The SFPA is leading on a technical response to the communication from the Chinese authorities before the end of November with a view to meaningful dialogue around reconsideration of the tissues to which this limit applies. To date, there have been two meetings with representatives of the crab industry to facilitate exploration of a range of approaches which may be adopted to address this challenge.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Marine Institute, that Irish waters have very low cadmium levels. It is important to bear in mind that heavy metals occur naturally at low levels in the marine environment and as such do not pose a food safety risk. I am satisfied that the procedures which are in place for monitoring the safety of Irish seafood, including live crab, meet the stringent European standards and consumers can continue to have high confidence in the quality of Irish seafood.   </p></reply>

The provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 are designed to improve the health and welfare of all animals and for the first time introduces a general prohibition on operations and procedures which interfere with the bone or sensitive tissue of an animal unless for veterinary treatment or unless provided for by regulation.   In working out which operations and procedures should be permitted under the Act, much weight was given to current, up to the minute, scientific research on animal welfare. While a general ban on tail docking for cosmetic purposes has been introduced and enforced, an allowance has been made for the docking of tails of a restricted list of dog breeds that are to be used for lawful pest control, hunting or shooting.  In these limited circumstances, the procedure  may now only be done by a veterinary professional rather than the owner or any other person as occurred heretofore. Such a veterinary professional is permitted to perform this procedure only where evidence is shown that the individual animal will be involved in lawful hunting, shooting or pest control.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland has recently updated its advice note on the Prophylactic Tail Docking of Dogs to reflect this legislative change. </p></reply>

Microchips must meet an internationally approved standard as set out in the regulations.

Of the 857 Partnerships registered with the Department before the closing date, 533 have received payments totalling &euro;12.4 million. While farmers&rsquo; dealings with the Revenue Commissioners are a matter for the relevant individual, my Department is continuing to process outstanding BPS cases for payment as a matter of priority with over &euro;1 billion anticipated to be paid to farmers by early December.</p>  <p>  EU Regulations governing the BPS require my Department to carry out administrative checks to verify that the eligibility conditions for aid have been met.   The regulations also require that these administrative checks be supplemented by on-the-spot checks, i.e. ground and/or remote sensing inspections. Furthermore , the regulations state that payments due under the Direct Payment schemes shall not be made before the verification of the eligibility conditions have been finalised.   In submitting an application under the BPS and other area based schemes , an applicant agrees to comply with the conditions of these schemes.   </p>  <p>  Where an individual application has been selected for a remote sensing inspection, no payment can issue to the applicant until the inspection has been completed and the results are fully processed. It should also be noted that EU regulations do not allow partial payments for these cases.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the number of on farm inspections and to remove the need for an initial farm visit my Department has moved to increase the use of remote sensing inspections using satellite imagery.   In 2015, approximately 90% of the cases elected for remote inspection have now been concluded and any payments due following application verification checks have issued.   It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to finalise all outstanding remote sensing cases as soon as possible.   </p></reply>

The value fluctuates from year to year depending on the climatic conditions during the summer.  There are almost 2,500 beekeepers in the country. Over 56% of these have 3 colonies or less whilst only 3% or approximately 70 beekeepers have more than 50 colonies. Only 5 beekeepers have over 150 colonies which many would consider to be a commercial apiary.   </p>  <p>  One of the major issues facing beekeeping is the issue of bee health and my Department recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population. With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the out-dated 1908 Bee Pest Prevention Act. American Foulbrood and the Small Hive Beetle are both notifiable diseases under the Notification and Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014 (SI No. 110 of 2014). While American Foulbrood has existed in Ireland for many years the Small Hive Beetle has never been found in Ireland. In response to the 2014 outbreak of Small Hive Beetle in Italy my Department established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year. This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeeping Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society. A similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland.  The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Teagasc, Oakpark in Carlow. Analysis of approximately 300 samples submitted by beekeepers each year are carried out.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides grant aid to Beekeepers under the national Horticultural Grant Scheme. The current Scheme is advertised on the Department's website with a closing date of 18 December 2015. In recognition of the smaller scale of beekeeping compared with other sectors of horticulture a minimum investment of &euro;2,000 is required compared to &euro;10,000 for other areas of horticulture.   </p>  <p>  The Department also provides an annual grant to the Federation of Irish Beekeepers&rsquo; Associations (FIBKA). The objective is to assist FIBKA meet its operating costs and thereby allow the association promote the craft of beekeeping among its members, including the organising of training courses as well as informing the general public of the role of bees in our environment.</p></reply>

Historically there were two herring stocks in the north western waters and correspondingly two separate ICES Total Allowable Catch (TAC) areas - Via South/VIIb,c and VIa North. Ireland has a 92% share of VIa south and a 15% share of VIa north.</p>  <p>  The TAC for 2015 for VIa south is zero. A mid year review of this stock was undertaken following new advice and a benchmarking exercise by ICES and the advice for 2015 was not changed.  This ICES advice for 2016 is for a zero TAC for both areas and recommends a re-building plan. There is within the advice the possibility of a reduced TAC that would be applicable to both areas. The added complexity is that while it is scientifically acknowledged that there are two separate herring stocks it has not proven possible to provide separate scientific advice. Work is ongoing on this issue but it may take some time before it is possible to supply such separate advice.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has yet to make any proposal for North West Herring for 2016. I will be arguing strongly in advance of the December Fisheries Council that a small commercial catch for both areas is justified by the scientific advice and such a quota will facilitate the ongoing work to separate the two stocks. I am also fully supportive of a rebuilding plan as recommended by ICES and supported by the Pelagic Advisory Council.   </p>  <p>  Consequently, with regard to this stock, my first priority is to try and convince the EU Commission that a small commercial catch is justified. In that regard, I will be working closely with the UK Minister, in particular, who has a strong interest in the VIa north stock and I will be seeking to reach agreement on the allocations between the areas for any such TAC. If I am successful in that endeavour, and given that the TACs and associated quotas are likely to be modest, I will be considering the allocation of this quota on an exceptional basis in consultation with stakeholders taking account of the interests of small operators who have limited other pelagic opportunities.</p></reply>

The White Paper recognises that there are several new and or enhanced platforms to be procured.</p><p>In the context of the Air Corps fleet, this includes the replacement of the Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks.  In addition it is intended that the two CASA 235s Maritime Patrol Aircraft will also be replaced.  The current EC 135 and AW 139 helicopter fleet in the Air Corps will continue to deliver the required Defence Forces support and other support capabilities over the lifetime of the White Paper.  The existing Pilatus PC9 training aircraft are not due for replacement until 2025. </p><p>The current Naval Service ship replacement programme will have replaced three Naval Service vessels when completed by July 2016.  The White Paper recognises that a minimum eight ship flotilla will be required.</p><p>The Army will continue to retain all-arms conventional military capabilities, and the principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas.  There will be a focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles and the most cost effective option of upgrading or replacing the current fleet will be identified.  A small number of armoured logistical vehicles will be procured for force protection overseas. </p><p>I am satisfied that the current provisions, together with the courses of action in the White Paper, will ensure that the Defence Forces are fully equipped to meet their assigned roles and taskings.</p></reply>

The High Level Panel made a number of recommendations in the Report including one to the effect that: &ldquo;Clear Headquarters-field authority, command and control must be provided for all military deployments, with tighter integration of operational and logistics concepts of operations and delivery.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  On 16 June 2015, the Panel delivered its report to the Secretary General. Drawing on the Panel's recommendations, the Secretary General has set out priorities and key actions required to bring the recommendations about.  The Secretary General of the United Nations action plan centres on three pillars: renewed focus on prevention and mediation; stronger regional-global partnerships; and new ways of planning and conducting United Nations peace operations to make them faster, more responsive and more accountable to the needs of countries and people in conflict.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence was pleased to provide input into Ireland's submission to the High Level Panel on Peace Operations appointed by the Secretary General of the United Nations on 31 October 2014.  Ireland looks forward over the coming year to taking an active part in discussion on how best to take forward the recommendations of the High-level Independent Report on Peace Operations.  In relation to progressing the recommendations, Ireland's objective will be to ensure that there are clear formalised mandates, concepts standards and procedures in place but also that there is scope and flexibility to respond effectively in evolving situations.</p></reply>

The subsequent attack in Mali clearly demonstrates the truly international dimensions of this issue.</p>  <p>  While these events have been truly shocking they cannot be allowed to undermine the democratic values that characterise our societies.</p>  <p>  The fact is that, just like other open and democratic states, Ireland cannot consider itself immune from the threat posed by international terrorism and extremism.  However, while an attack is possible here, it is currently considered unlikely.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the activities of a small number of people based here give rise to concern.  However they will continue to be monitored closely and all appropriate measures will be taken in this regard but, for obvious security reasons, I cannot go into the details of the operational responses.</p>  <p>  As I have already indicated, this is an international problem and a key element in dealing with these threats is good intelligence-sharing internationally.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na co-operates very closely with their EU and other international security and intelligence counterparts in responding to these threats.</p>  <p>  I also met with my EU colleagues as recently as last Friday where a number of measures have been identified for progress, notably tighter controls on firearms and measures to further enhance intelligence sharing and exchange of information.</p>  <p>  It is, of course, essential that at times like this entire communities are not stigmatised because of the actions of a few.  It has to be recognised that the vast majority of people in our minority communities only wish to go about their daily lives in peace.  It is very clear that the appalling actions of a small number of extremists, such as we have seen in Paris and elsewhere, do not reflect the views of the vast majority of the Muslim community in this country, or in other states.</p></reply>

The considerable powers already available to Garda&iacute;  are now supplemented further by the DNA Database system which went live last week and which has the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist Garda&iacute; in investigating a whole range of serious offences.</p>  <p>  I am not convinced at this stage that some form of firearms amnesty would make a useful contribution to the reduction of gun crime.  There was such an arrangement for a two month period in late 2006 but that was in the context of new licensing arrangements being introduced and represented an opportunity for people to regularise their situation before the heavier penalties provided for in the legislation came into force.  It is doubtful that such an amnesty would result in hardened criminals handing up weapons.  Equally, I am not convinced it is desirable to allow people who hold firearms illegally to evade the legal consequences for that.  Nevertheless, I will keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware the Irish Prison Service collates and publishes the prisoner population breakdown, including those on temporary release, on a daily basis and this information is available on the Irish Prison Service website (www.irishprisons.ie).  </p>  <p>  On 20 November 2015 there were 3,735 prisoners in custody which is 94% of the Inspector's recommended total capacity of 3,982.  Significant decreases in prison numbers have taken place.  The overall daily average number in custody for 2014 was 3,915 compared to 4,390 in 2011, a decrease of 10.8%. The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23 February 2011, on the 20 November 2015, there were 886 less prisoners in custody, a decrease of 19%.  </p>  <p>  The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances.  It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering the unpaid fine. As a result of this legislation, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prisons on short sentences.</p></reply>

In this regard the courts are independent in matters of sentencing and, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  </p>  <p>  In respect of sentencing, the position is that the law generally sets out the maximum sentence that can be imposed for an offence and it is then a matter for the court to decide the appropriate sentence in each particular case, taking into account all the circumstances.  However, provision has also been made in legislation requiring the courts to impose custodial sentences consecutively in certain situations, including where offences are committed by persons on bail.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 which deals with the issue of multiple home burglaries and is currently before this House.  In practice many burglary offences are committed by the same persons and the Bill will amend existing legislation to require a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglary offences committed within a 12 month window to impose such sentences consecutively.  This Bill is being progressed very actively by the Government and I expect that it will be enacted during the current parliamentary session.</p>  <p>  As regards bail conditions, the position is that in July the Government approved the drafting of a Bail Bill which will strengthen the operation of the bail system and make the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.  This legislation is currently being drafted on a priority basis and it is my intention that the Bill will be published as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The new Bail Bill will contain a number of provisions to strengthen protection for victims.  For example, in addition to any other bail condition that a court can impose, the Bill will provide that a court may require an accused person not to have contact with the victim of the alleged offence or any member of the victim&rsquo;s family unless the contact is authorised by the court.  I also propose to make specific provision in the Bill for victim evidence to be heard in bail proceedings in cases where there may be a likelihood of harm or intimidation to the victim or a family member of the victim.  </p>  <p>  Both I and my Department engage extensively with groups representing victims of crime.  In this context I always consider carefully any proposals for legislative changes the groups put forward. </p></reply>

The Act provides that the Service is independent in the performance of its functions, including the provision of courthouse facilities.</p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquires made and the Courts Service has informed me that it is acutely aware of the importance of ensuring that victims of crime and their relatives are treated in a sensitive and sympathetic manner while attending court. In this regard the Courts Service provides facilities including dedicated waiting areas for victims and victim support organisations in many courthouses.  This requirement is built into the design of all new and refurbished courthouses.</p><p>I am further informed that the Courts Service, where requested, facilitates courtroom visits by victim support organisations prior to trials for familiarisation purposes. It also assists with access to the victim support areas within courthouses and, where possible, in serious criminal cases reserves seats in court for victims. In the Criminal Courts of Justice there is a dedicated area for witnesses to give evidence to the Court by video conferencing where appropriate.</p><p>The Courts Service accepts that in some courthouses, especially those which have not been refurbished, the facilities provided are not ideal but nevertheless, on advance notice, every effort is made by the Courts Service to accommodate the requirements of victims in so far as possible given the infrastructure of these buildings.</p><p>In addition, my Department funds 50 non-government organisations that provide support and assistance to victims of crime.A substantial amount of the funding provided is towards the provision of a court accompaniment service to victims of crime and their families attending court.  Since 2005, it has allocated over &euro;630,000 to <i>Victim Support at Court</i>who provide a court accompaniment service for victims and their families attending the Central Criminal Court.  In addition to practical support for the court case, they also refer victims of crime, their families or witnesses to other support agencies or organisations as appropriate. </p></reply>

If people are unwilling to do this they have the option to approach the immigration authorities to seek permission to remain in the State.  Such cases would be carefully considered, taking the all relevant circumstances into account, before any final decision was made.  An important factor in any such consideration would be the circumstances in which the person concerned became undocumented.  In some cases that decision would result in their being granted leave to remain.  In other instances they would be required to leave the State and to respect the decision of the Irish authorities. </p><p>While I appreciate the Deputy's concerns on this issue, it is the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Most migrants do in fact comply with this condition and obey the State's immigration laws.  Any disruption to a person's working life needs to be seen in the context of their having no entitlement to engage in such work.  </p><p>Ireland has shown itself to be a country that is open to migration and it is quite clear that those who opt to abide by our rules benefit from doing so and we continue to provide a safe haven to those who come here to seek our protection.  <b></b></p><p>I have no plans to implement a regularisation programme for those who are currently undocumented in the State. A programme of this nature could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.I am also conscious that any significant departure from well established policies will invariably have implications for our immigration controls and the smooth functioning of the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. </p><p>The Deputy might wish to note that at EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases. This is the approach that has been consistently followed by successive Ministers in this respect.</p></reply>

These were persons who were considered by their sponsoring family member present in Ireland to be most at risk. 116 beneficiaries were granted admission under the programme.</p><p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the SHAP immigration stamp has been endorsed on the passports of 78 persons granted temporary permission under the Programme and that 101 visas have issued to date to those granted temporary residence permission under the Programme.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>It is open to Syrian nationals ordinarily resident in the State to apply for family reunification as provided for in S18 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, or under the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification, which is available on the INIS website, www.inis.gov.ie.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p><p>I have no plans to renew this particular Programme. The Deputy will, however, be aware that, in response to the continuing migration crisis facing Europe, the Government has committed to accepting up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU Relocation and EU Resettlement programmes.  </p><p>The EU Commission is currently finalising Ireland's contribution to the Relocation Programme  which is indicated to be over 2,600.  It is expected that this number will be augmented by further family reunifications.  The timescales for Relocation are for a two year period with the first persons expected to arrive in the coming weeks.  </p><p>I have established a Taskforce comprising of relevant Departments and agencies together with organisations including the UNHCR and the Red Cross to draw together the various strands of the programme.  A Programme Office has been established in my Department to oversee the programme and a dedicated Relocation Unit has also been set-up in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to process cases for refugee determination. Ireland has also appointed Liaison Officers to both Italy and Greece and has nominated two additional experts to the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) to support the work of the hotspots. </p><p>In addition, Ireland is committed to accepting persons to Ireland under the UNHCR led refugee resettlement programme. To date in 2015 under this programme 100 refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict have been admitted from Jordan and Lebanon. It is planned that 80 additional refugees will be admitted from Lebanon before Christmas with a further hundred refugees expected to be admitted to Ireland from Lebanon in the New Year. The remaining cases will be admitted on a gradually increasing phased basis thereafter.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b></p></reply>

The Bill provides for two new offences of purchasing sexual services, in the context of prostitution.  The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not commit an offence. </p><p>These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  </p><p>The Bill completed second stage in the Seanad on 6 October and is expected to be considered in the Houses during the current session.  </p><p>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.

Well-advanced plans for a new facility in Backweston, Co. Kildare, were cancelled by the previous Government in 2009 as a result of the financial crisis.  I was happy, therefore, to secure the funding necessary to proceed with construction of a new laboratory in the recently announced capital expenditure programme, with these funds set to become available in 2019.  In light of the importance of this project and the pressing need for these facilities, however, I intend to keep the projected start date under review and want to make clear that if an opportunity arises to bring forward the start date of construction at Backweston, then this opportunity will be pursued.</p></reply>

Prior to that more ad hoc arrangements were applied in this area.  </p>  <p>  Persons who were granted permission prior to the changes however are not affected and their permissions can be renewed on the same terms as before provided they continue to comply with the terms of their permission and remain law abiding.     </p>  <p>  The immigration stamp has been changed from Stamp 3 to stamp 0 for new cases which is a low level permission not intended to be reckonable for naturalisation or long term residence.  This is consistent with the permission granted to the elderly dependent relatives of Irish citizens or others already entitled to live here.  The key financial consideration in respect of a retiree is that the person must have sufficient and sustainable resources to ensure that they will not now or in the future become a burden on the State.  In the case of retirees this was set at an income of &euro;50,000 per person.  They were also expected to have a lump sum sufficient to cater for unforeseen circumstances and sufficient otherwise to purchase some form of dwelling.  </p>  <p>  I have however, asked my officials to carry out a review of policy in this area,  having regard to the situation in comparable jurisdictions and in particular the opportunities open to Irish retirees seeking residence overseas.</p></reply>

The overall daily average number in custody for 2014 was 3,915 compared to 4,390 in 2011, a decrease of 10.8%. The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23rd February 2011. On the 23rd November 2015, there were 921 less prisoners in custody, a decrease of 20%.  I can also advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service publish the capacity of its prisons and the numbers in custody on a daily basis on their website ).  </p><p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is continuing to reduce the capacity of our prisons to align with the Inspector of Prisons recommended bed capacity of 3,977 in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.  On 23rd November 2015 there were 3,700 prisoners in custody which is 93% of the Inspector's recommended total capacity of 3,977. </p><p>Huge improvements have been made to prison conditions in recent years. Overcrowding has been eliminated in Mountjoy Prison and priority has been given to addressing capacity issues in Cork, Limerick and the D&oacute;chas Centre. A completely new replacement prison in Cork is almost complete and will be operational by early 2016. The enabling works for a major redevelopment of Limerick Prison are also scheduled to begin in 2016 with the main construction phase to start in early 2017.  Significant building and refurbishment projects are also scheduled for 2016 in Castlerea Prison.  </p><p>The Programme for Government outlines the commitment of this Government to finding alternatives to custody as a means of reducing overcrowding.  We continue to ensure that violent offenders and other serious offenders serve appropriate prison sentences while at the same time switching away from prison sentences and towards less costly non-custodial options for non-violent and less serious offenders.</p><p>Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed. This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires the sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered. </p><p>In conjunction with the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service has continued the national roll out of the Community Return Programme, an incentivised scheme for earned temporary release under which carefully selected offenders can be granted structured temporary release in return for supervised community service. In addition to this programme, Community Support Schemes have been set up in Cork Prison, Mountjoy Campus, West Dublin Campus and Limerick Prisons, the aim of which is to reduce recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.</p><p>The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances. It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering the unpaid fine. As a result of this legislation, it is expected that we will see a reduction in the number of committals to prisons on short sentences.</p></reply>

Accommodating this increase requires a significant increase in capacity in the pre-school sector; pre-school services need time to consider and implement any needed infrastructural or service changes, and to put in place extra staff resources. The September 2016 implementation date was set to allow pre-school providers to put such measures in place.  </p>  <p>  It is appreciated that this does mean that a small cohort of children, including those mentioned by the Deputy, while continuing to avail of the 38 week entitlement to free pre-school currently provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, will not benefit from additional free pre-school provided under this new budgetary measure. However, should an earlier start date have been chosen, the likelihood is that there would not have been sufficient capacity in the sector to accommodate all children.</p>  <p>  However, you will appreciate that this extended provision, when introduced, will ensure that, from the age of three, all children in Ireland will be able to access free education, either in pre-school or in primary school. This is a significant step forward for children and families.</p></reply>

This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.  </p>  <p>  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefitting from the programme, which is estimated to increase from 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year.  The extension to this programme will cost an additional &euro;47 million in 2016.  The full year additional costs of this extended programme will be in the region of &euro;114 million.

Health related therapy supports and interventions for children, such as speech and language therapy, can be accessed through both the HSE&rsquo;s primary care services and its disability services, depending on the level of need.  Significant additional resources have been invested in recent years in the State&rsquo;s primary care and disability services with a view to enhancing therapy service provision. </p><p>Additional funding of &euro;20m was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts, including over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams.  In addition, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives specifically in relation to speech and language therapy services that are aimed at improving access to these services, such as therapists increasing clinic based work and providing family centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.  </p><p>The HSE is also currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)<i>.</i>The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Progressing Disability Services Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year) has been provided this year to support its ongoing implementation. </p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, funding is being provided in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy through primary care services and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  Full implementation of the Progressing Disability Services Programme is expected before the end of 2016.</p><p>I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in respect of the specific operational matters he has raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme. The conditions covered by the LTI Scheme are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

On this basis, the title of physiotherapist will be protected for the exclusive use of the board's registrants when the register's 2 year transitional period ends in 2018.  </p><p>I am currently examining the issue of also protecting the title of <i>physical therapist </i>under the Act.In other English speaking countries, the title of  <i>physical therapist </i>is often used by physiotherapists.  In Ireland, however, the title is used by a number of practitioners who are not physiotherapists but who are competing with physiotherapists in the private sector in the provision of musculoskeletal therapies.</p><p>Earlier this year, having consulted with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, I wrote to a number of relevant organisations regarding my proposal to protect the title of <i>physical therapist </i>as a variant of the title of <i>physiotherapist</i>and invited them to submit their views. The submissions are now being examined and I expect that I will make a decision on the matter before the end of the year. As the Deputy can appreciate there are many factors to consider. However, I can assure the House that my main concern will be to protect the public when it comes to decisions on this matter. </p></reply>

The Government currently provides funding of approximately &euro;1.5 billion to the Disability Services Programme through the Health Service Executive's National Service Plan for 2015.</p>  <p>  In 2015, the HSE is seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources and to maintaining a consistent level to that provided in 2014, by providing the following specialist disability services:</p>  <p>- residential services to around 9,000 people with a disability;</p>  <p>- day services to over 22,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities;</p>  <p>- respite residential support of 190,000 overnights for people with intellectual and physical disabilities;</p>  <p>- 3.9 million hours of Personal Assistant / Home Support Hours.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;6 million has been allocated in the HSE National Service Plan in 2015 to provide day places for an estimated 1,400 young people finishing school and rehabilitative (life-skills) training.  &euro;4m in additional funding has also been allocated in the Plan to deliver an increase in the services for children with disabilities and reduce waiting lists under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding to L'Arche Community for the provision of health and personal social services under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004. My Department has not held any formal meetings with the HSE in relation to the current difficulties facing L'Arche. However, I am aware of the financial challenges facing L&rsquo;Arche Community at this time and that the HSE has been in ongoing contact with the management of L&rsquo;Arche in an effort to find a solution to these difficulties.</p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that these difficulties stem from compliance issues with the regulatory environment, which require that the model of service previously provided by L&rsquo;Arche be reviewed and enhanced. The HSE has been working with all voluntary service providers on improving compliance during 2015, addressing the highest risk areas as a priority. These efforts will continue in 2016 and preparation of the HSE&rsquo;s Service and Operational Plans will be underpinned by a focus on making the best use of the resource invested in disability services.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by the HSE that it will continue to work with  L&rsquo;Arche Community and be as supportive as possible within current financial constraints.</p></reply>

This provides their patients with an option of receiving this service locally in a primary care setting rather than attending an acute hospital for this service. Warfarin testing is available free of charge in hospitals.</p>  <p>  Consultation fees charged by general practitioners outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.

However, on a year-by-year basis the HSE mental health budget has also been subject to downward adjustments for pay and procurement savings, similar to other HSE service areas.</p><p>I am pleased that I have secured a further &euro;35 million for mental health for 2016.  This means that during the lifetime of this Government, we will have provided a total of &euro;160 million ring-fenced funding for mental health up to the end of 2016, to develop and enhance our mental health services.  My priorities for next year include the development of quality counselling services across both primary and secondary care, the expansion of the Jigsaw youth mental health service to Dublin and Cork city centres, investment in improved 24/7 responses and liaison services and Psychiatry of Later Life. The level of health services to be provided within the available funding will be set out in the HSE&rsquo;s 2016 National Service Plan, which is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>The staff of our health service is our largest and most important resource. In relation to the staffing level, at the end of 2006, the mental health services employed 9,985 WTE staff.  It currently stands at approximately 9,300 WTE staff.  It is acknowledged that, notwithstanding the additional 1,150 new posts approved for mental health since 2012, the numbers employed in the service have been reducing over recent years for a number of reasons including retirements, staff leaving to take up other posts, and the moratorium on recruitment etc. However, while staffing levels have fallen there are some positives that must be acknowledged:</p><p>- Many of the staff numbers lost were supporting the excessive numbers of beds which are no longer part of the service user recovery focused modern community based-service model for mental health.</p><p>- We have been able to mitigate the overall reduction in numbers thanks to the priority ring-fenced Programme for Government investments since 2012.</p><p>- This investment has allowed us to begin to re-balance the staff skill mix in mental health to introduce new staff in the historically under represented disciplines recommended in Vision i.e. psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that this Government remains committed to prioritising and improving our mental health services.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they who face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.</p>  <p>  It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner. Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to nearly 96,000 at the beginning of November this year. This followed the measures announced by Minister Varadkar and I last year, when the "Keane" Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility was published. The Deputy may be aware that a key recommendation of that report was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE accepted an interim recommendation of the Group to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, effective from 1 July 2015.  Any child not 18 and who has had a diagnosis of cancer within the preceding 5 years ending 30 June 2015 may be awarded a medical card under the terms of this decision for such period, not to exceed five years, as seems appropriate in the individual circumstances. The Group is continuing its work  on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.</p>  <p>  We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services. Until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, one will always have anomalies and injustices. There will always be somebody who is just above the means threshold, or who does not have the prescribed disease, or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, I have asked the HSE,  which operates the General Medical Services scheme, to respond directly to the Deputy. If  a reply from the HSE has not been received within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and my officials will follow the matter up.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made to date on the overall ED Taskforce plan, with reductions in delayed discharges and waiting times for NHSS funding, allied with increased provision for transitional care funding, home care packages and nursing home beds. All hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the 2015/16 winter period, hospital groups have provided comprehensive winter resilience plans to the HSE, outlining how they will implement an integrated approach across primary, community, social and acute services to manage winter pressures.  This approach is intended both to avoid unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals and to expedite discharges from hospital efficiently.  Within hospitals themselves, a total of 129 beds which had been closed for refurbishment or for infection control purposes during 2015 are to be re-opened by the end of November.  A further 301 beds are being added nationally to support the acute hospital system over the winter period across various locations, including Letterkenny, which is to open an 10 additional beds. &euro;18m in funding has been provided to support these developments.</p>  <p>  As the  trolley issues  referred to in Letterkenny are a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The HPRA have been seeking to find an alternative supply of BCG that meets safety, quality and effectiveness standards and that could be used in Ireland.  To date no appropriate alternative manufacturer of BCG vaccine has been found.</p>  <p>  In Ireland the number of cases of Tuberculosis (TB) has been falling and there were no cases of TB in young children in 2014.  Young children are not at risk of TB because of the delay in getting BCG vaccine in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The supplier of BCG vaccine has informed the HSE that the vaccine will not be delivered to Ireland until the beginning of January 2016 at the earliest.  When the vaccine is delivered there will be sufficient quantity to vaccinate all babies who have not received the vaccine.

Regrettably, it was not possible to find an overall agreement, with a particular difficulty around finding the appropriate balance between the onward disclosure needs of families and arrangements necessary to protect national security.  In the final hours of the talks it became clear that the choice was between removing the legacy elements from the agreement or having no agreement and thus seeing a grave risk to the future of power-sharing institutions.  I argued strongly for at least those elements on which agreement had been reached remaining in the text.  To my disappointment this did not prove possible.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that good progress was made on agreeing many of the details necessary for the establishment of the new institutional framework for dealing with the legacy of the past. Based on the talks we have had over ten weeks, I believe that agreement is very close on many of the details necessary for the establishment of these new institutions, including on; ensuring the operational independence of the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU); guaranteeing the anonymity and inadmissibility of information provided to the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval (ICIR) while making clear that there would be no amnesty for any criminal offences; placing the Implementation and Reconciliation Group (IRG) on a statutory footing and settling on the purpose and functions of the IRG; and on the detail and operation of the Oral History Archive (OHA). </p>  <p>  Building on this substantial progress made in the talks, the two Governments will reflect further on the remaining open issues and on how they will be advanced. This will involve engaging with the other parties to find an agreed basis for the establishment of the institutions dealing with the past.</p>  <p>  As part of this process I will meet the NI Victims Commissioner this week and my officials are undertaking a round of consultations with victims groups in order to ensure that they are at the heart of how we take this forward. I know that victims and their families feel let down and I am determined that this Government will not be found wanting in playing its part to put things back on track.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Government is committed to fulfilling its specific commitments on establishing the institutions  dealing with the past and the necessary enabling legislation will be introduced in the Oireachtas at the appropriate time. The international agreement necessary for the establishment of the ICIR has also been agreed between the British and Irish Governments. </p>  <p>  I remain convinced that the new legacy institutions as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement are the best way of providing whatever healing is possible to the victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families, including those affected by collusion.  </p>  <p>  The establishment of these institutions in accordance with the Stormont House Agreement remains a priority for the Government. The needs of victims and survivors will remain central to our work. We are determined to achieve the establishment of these institutions so that we can in a fundamental way deal with the past, foster reconciliation and build a society for future generations that is free from hurt and suspicion.</p></reply>

Each application received by the Department must, therefore, contain evidence that demonstrates that person&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue.</p><p>The two children in question were born in the State in 2011 and 2013.  Their entitlement to Irish citizenship is therefore subject to the terms of section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 2004 (the 1956 Act).<font color="#004080"> </font>This provides that a person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that<font color="#004080"> </font>person&rsquo;s birth.</p><p>Moreover, the 2004 amendment allows nationals of EU Member States to make a declaration (Form A) in respect of their residence in the island of Ireland within the four years preceding their children&rsquo;s birth.  In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of the 1956 Act, unless the contrary is proven. These declarations must be supported in passport applications for children by original documentary evidence that must verify the actual and continuous residence of the parents in question.</p><p>A passport application for the older of the two siblings was received in August 2011.  The applicant&rsquo;s father submitted a fully complete Form A in which he declared that he had been resident in the State since May 2004.  The evidence submitted, comprising tax documents, showed that he had the required residence within the four year period preceding this child&rsquo;s date of birth (i.e. March 2007 to March 2011) to demonstrate his child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.  In view of this and given that all other aspects of the application were compliant with the Act, a passport was issued.</p><p>In the case of the youngest child, a passport application was submitted to the Department by her mother last July.  This application differs from the oldest child in the following respects:</p><blockquote>-  This child was born in April 2013.  The four year period of evidence of residence of a parent extends from April 2009 to April 2013 which is a later timeframe to that of the older child; and<br /><br />-  The submitted Form A was completed by the applicant&rsquo;s mother.  The evidence required of her residence in State is therefore different from that of the father in the case of the older child.</blockquote><p>To verify evidence of residence within the review period of April 2009 to April 2013, the applicant&rsquo;s mother has submitted the following documents:</p><p>-  Correspondence from Roscommon County Council, dated from 22 February 2010 to 18 May 2012, in regard to the allocation and rental of council property to her; and</p><p>-  Correspondence from the Department of Social Protection, dated 4 March 2010 regarding the payment of benefits.</p><p>The evidence above is insufficient to demonstrate the youngest child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.  The Department has been in direct contact with the applicant&rsquo;s mother to inform her of this position and to outline the outstanding requirements to finalise this child&rsquo;s application to passport issue.  She has two options in this regard:</p><blockquote>-  Provide further documentary evidence (tax certificates, utility bills, bank statements etc)  in respect of residence from April 2009 to February 2010 and/or May 2012 to April 2013; or<br /><br />-  A Form A is provided by the child&rsquo;s father and similar documentary evidence (as in (a) above) in respect of his residence in the State between April 2009 and April 2013 is submitted. </blockquote><p>Once the required evidence of residence is submitted the application process will be completed in a timely manner.</p></reply>

I also note that, in the case of Senator Iv&aacute;n Cepeda, an application for precautionary measures has been made to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).</p>  <p>  Both matters are stark reminders that Colombia faces significant challenges in overcoming decades of violence.  Peace talks are continuing in Havana and I welcome the major announcement last September between the Colombian government and the main guerrilla organisation, FARC, on a final date for the signature of a peace accord (23 March 2016) and of the transitional justice measures that will be part of this agreement.  This agreement underscores the extent to which the Colombian peace process has now reached a point of no return.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the recent announcement by High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, Federica Mogherini, appointing the former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, as Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process. Deputy Gilmore made his first visit to Bogot&aacute; last week in his capacity as special envoy and his programme included a meeting with President Santos who has underlined the importance he attaches to Deputy Gilmore's appointment as a political signal of the EU's commitment to Colombia and the successful conclusion and implementation of the peace process. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support efforts towards achieving a lasting peace in Colombia.</p>  <p>  The promotion and protection of human rights is also a core principle of Ireland's foreign policy. When I met with the Colombian Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms. Patti Londo&ntilde;o, in Dublin on 18 June 2015 I raised the human rights situation in Colombia with her, emphasising the importance Ireland places on protecting trades unionists, human rights defenders, journalists and others.</p>  <p>  Officers from our Embassy in Mexico regularly discuss human rights issues with government interlocutors during their visits to Colombia and meet with international and local civil society organisations working on human rights issues there, including on environmental rights.  In addition, Irish Aid provides funding to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Colombia which is specifically targeted on the work of promoting human rights in Colombia.</p>  <p>  Human rights in Colombia are a major concern for the EU, including Ireland and other member states, and are addressed in detail in the context of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue. Through this mechanism, which addresses the subject directly with the Colombian authorities at official level, the EU engages in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including as regards human rights defenders and trade unionists, prisoners, land restitution and environmental issues.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-24a.1114.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015112400078#WRU01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 448 to 451, inclusive, and 454 to 458, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  Following ten weeks of intensive discussions involving the five main Northern Ireland parties and the British and Irish Governments, an agreement entitled &lsquo;A Fresh Start: The Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan&rsquo; was reached on Tuesday 17 November. </p>  <p>  I believe that this agreement provides a credible road map for the implementation of many aspects of the Stormont House Agreement as well as ending paramilitarism and tackling associated organized crime and criminality. </p>  <p>  With regard to paramilitarism, significantly the parties to the Agreement have made a firm commitment to achieving a society free of paramilitarism, to working for the disbandment of all paramilitary organisations and their structures and to challenging paramilitary attempts to control communities. A strategy to achieve this will be put in place by the Northern Ireland Executive and an international body will be established to report on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Irish and British Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive have also committed to reinforce our efforts to tackle organised crime associated with the legacy of paramilitarism. We have agreed to establish a Joint Agency Task Force to identify strategic priorities for combatting cross-border organised crime and to oversee operational co-ordination. This work will be supported by additional resources. In addition, a tri-lateral cross-border Ministerial meeting will take place next month between Minister Fitzgerald and her counterparts from the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to agree new measures to further enhance law enforcement cooperation.</p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement is also about financial stability and reform. Pursuing economic prosperity and job creation is critical to building a peaceful society in Northern Ireland. In recognition of this, the Irish Government has committed to providing support and funding for important infrastructure projects as well as for investment in the North West Region. </p>  <p>  In the Agreement, the Irish Government restated its commitment under the St Andrews Agreement to co-fund the construction of the A5 through Northern Ireland to Derry, which will improve access to Derry and North Donegal. Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the Government specifically reaffirms its existing commitment to providing funding of &pound;50 million for this project and commits to providing an additional &pound;25 million to ensure that Phase 1 of the project can commence as soon as the necessary planning issues have been resolved by the Northern Ireland authorities. In accordance with the revised project timeline, this funding will be provided in three tranches of &pound;25 million in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively and therefore it has been agreed that the first section of the A5 will commence in 2017 and this will be the route between Newbuildings (outside Derry) to north of Strabane. </p>  <p>  Under the Agreement, the Government is committed to continue exploring the development of cross-border Greenways and Blueway cycling-walking-water leisure routes, including the Ulster Canal. In February 2015, the Government announced &euro;2 million for the restoration of the 2.5 km Upper Lough Erne to Castle Saunderson section. This is due to be completed in 2017. We have also agreed with the Northern Ireland Executive to undertake a review to identify options for jointly developing future phases of the Ulster Canal restoration project, which will be considered by the North South Ministerial Council in June 2016. </p>  <p>  In the Agreement, the Government has also reiterated our commitment to the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge. We have agreed with the Northern Ireland Executive to undertake a review of the project to identify options for future development which will also be considered at the North South Ministerial Council in June 2016. </p>  <p>  In addition the Government has decided to provide funding of &euro;2.5 million to support the North West Gateway Initiative, which will be complemented by matching funding from the Northern Ireland Executive. This is a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to support the regional development work of the North West Gateway Initiative which will be of real benefit to Donegal as well as Derry. </p>  <p>  In order to drive these projects forward, a group of senior officials from the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government will meet regularly to maintain a strategic overview of economic and infrastructural investment. Regular progress reports will be provided to the North South Ministerial Council. This group will also consider opportunities for sourcing further investment for all-island infrastructure projects for mutual benefit, including through PPPs, EU funding and other non-Exchequer sources. </p>  <p>  I believe that the funding committed by the Irish Government under the Fresh Start Agreement, which amounts to &euro;110 million in total, represents a good investment for the people of Ireland.  This investment is aimed at unlocking the full potential of the all island economy. Such targeted investment in cross border economic infrastructure will be key to continued growth of the island&rsquo;s indigenous enterprise base, boosting tourism and to driving and sustaining overseas investment levels. This is crucial for job creation and all-island prosperity and to ensure that the socio-economic dividend made possible by the Good Friday and subsequent Agreements is fully realised. This funding will therefore benefit all citizens on the island of Ireland. I would add that this financial commitment is predicated on a stable political environment in Northern Ireland, with all the institutions and North South bodies operating to full effect. It is therefore important that the Fresh Start Agreement is fully implemented. </p>  <p>  In this Agreement, the British Government has also recognised the importance of underpinning the implementation of its provisions by way of financial support so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s public finances can be placed on a sound footing, which is so important for economic stability and development, and to assist with the transition of Northern Ireland from a society emerging from decades of conflict. The Fresh Start Agreement paves the way for the implementation of the financial package committed to the British Government under the Stormont House Agreement which gives the Northern Ireland Executive &pound;2 billion in additional spending. The British Government has now agreed to provide further financial support of around &pound;500 million which is aimed at assisting the Northern Ireland Executive in tackling issues unique to Northern Ireland such as support for programmes to remove peace walls. </p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement also agrees a way forward on Welfare reform. While the necessary legislation will be passed at Westminster, the Welfare Bill was, in accordance with the Agreement, debated and approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly by way of a Legislative Consent Motion on 18 November. This approval also covered the draft Order in Council which gives effect in Northern Ireland to the 2012 welfare changes in Britain, the welfare clauses of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill as initially introduced at Westminster and the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s proposals to enhance payments flowing from the Fresh Start Agreement. </p>  <p>  This was agreed by the two main parties in Northern Ireland, working through the power sharing devolved Executive, and endorsed by the Northern Ireland Assembly. The explicit consent given by the Assembly protects the principle of devolved government in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Under the Fresh Start Agreement, the Northern Ireland Executive has agreed to allocate a total of &pound;585 million from Executive funds over four years to &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; welfare arrangements in Northern Ireland through welfare enhancements and tax credits. The Executive has agreed to establish a small working group under the leadership of Professor Eileen Evason to bring forward proposals within this financial envelope to maximise the use of these additional resources. The Executive has agreed to implement the findings of the working group. </p>  <p>  While important progress was made on taking forward aspects of the Stormont House Agreement dealing with the legacy of the past, it did not prove possible to resolve all of the key issues within the timescale of this negotiation. Nevertheless, the two Governments will persist in our efforts to secure an agreed basis for the establishment of the institutions dealing with the past envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement. </p>  <p>  I believe that the Fresh Start Agreement presents a very positive result at the end of 10 weeks of intensive and often challenging negotiations. I regret the fact that some of the parties were not in a position to fully sign up to this Agreement. This was not due to a lack of effort by the Government. I consistently urged all participants to work towards an outcome which would be as comprehensive and inclusive as possible throughout the talks process. It was, however, inevitable that the two largest parties needed to take a leading role as without their shared support there would be no agreement. I believe that this demonstrates a maturity in the politics of Northern Ireland and that power-sharing can in fact work as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  That said, I believe that the agreement reflects positive contributions made to the talks process by all of the parties involved, especially when it comes to the measures agreed on ending paramilitarism and tackling criminality.  I absolutely accept that each party needs to make their own decision about the content of this agreement and to have the necessary time to do this. Careful consideration will, I hope, enable some of the other parties to get behind elements of the agreement many of which are clearly of great importance to them and to the people they represent. </p>  <p>  The Fresh Start Agreement is about protecting the gains delivered by the Good Friday Agreement and placing devolved power-sharing government on a sustainable footing. It is now important that government in Northern Ireland delivers for the people of Northern Ireland. It is for the parties to this agreement, with the support of the two Governments, to ensure that this new opportunity is fully embraced.  </p></reply>

The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my  Department's Circular 0030/2014. </p><p>  It is important to note that each school's allocation of SNA support can change  from year to year and may be increased or decreased as students who qualify for  SNA support enrol or leave a school.  New students with care needs may, or may  not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or SNA allocations  may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time. </p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual  Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a  manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled  in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for  schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need,  which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by  18th March 2015.  The NCSE also continued to accept applications after this date  in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments  were not completed.  </p><p>  The NCSE has published details of SNA allocations for schools for September  2015 on its website www.ncse.ie.  </p><p>  The website indicates that the school in question had an allocation of 12 whole  time equivalent (WTE) SNA posts in the 2014/15 school year and has retained the  same allocation of SNA posts for the 2015/16 school year.  </p><p>  I understand that the NCSE recently visited the school on foot of an enquiry  received from the school authorities in relation to its SNA allocation and,  having considered all available information, has determined that the SNA  allocation for the school for 2015/16 is a sufficient level of support to cater  for the care needs of all qualifying children enrolled in the school.  </p><p>  I understand also that the SENO has met with parents of pupils attending the  school to discuss the allocation process and has informed the school of the  appeal process which applies in relation to SNA allocations.  </p><p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while parents may  also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special  educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

SNAs should be deployed by the school  in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children  enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter  for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual  need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>  Parents who have concerns regarding the manner in which the resources or  facilities which have been provided to support their child's education are  being applied in school should, in the first instance, raise this matter  directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school. </p><p>  Details of the manner in which a school or parent may appeal the level of SNA  or resource teaching allocation which has been made to support a child in  school, to the NCSE, is set out on the NCSE website. </p><p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may  also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special  educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website. </p><p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that the availability and provision of  health-related therapy services, including speech and language therapy  supports, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, and matters in  relation to the provision of health-related services should therefore be  directed to that body or to the Department of Health.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>  <p>  SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year, in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents are encouraged to liaise with the local SENO to discuss placement options for their child.</p>  <p>  The NCSE will continue to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes, where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes. Where a school opens a special class the NCSE will allocate supports to the class to meet the educational and care needs of the students enrolled.</p>  <p>  In addition to the mainstream educational provision provided for, there are over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level.  The number of special classes at post primary level has risen by approximately 70 classes in the last 3 years.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that there are currently 12 special classes, including 11 autism specific classes, at post primary level in Co. Kildare.  Each special class for autism at post-primary level has a 6:1.5 pupil teacher ratio.</p></reply>

However, there are many established supports to good practice, by both employers and students in these cases, including:</p><p>-  guidelines on work placement from the PDST and coordinators' organisations;</p><p>-  extensions of school insurance policies to cover work placement contexts for students;</p><p>-  contemporaneous monitoring of work placement by teacher visits and/or phone calls;</p><p>-  evaluation reports by employers and students of the work placement experience immediately afterwards;</p><p>-  DES inspection recommendations that work experience remain controlled and not otherwise disrupt the integrity of the programme.</p><p>These are established aspects of custom and practice in the Irish system, often supplemented by extra supports depending on circumstances of employment, such as additional safety training.  Schools are encouraged to evaluate their work placement programmes annually, and this helps the development of reliable, quality employment opportunities, linked in most instances to the local community.</p><p>  The question refers to students taking third-level courses while in post-primary school.  This would not be the norm. </p><p>  The rules and practice governing the relationship between schools and employers in the area of work experience is a matter for the schools and local employers themselves.  Access to work experience for second level students is an extremely valuable element of education and provides students with experience and knowledge that will help inform decisions regarding future studies and career options.</p></reply>

For example one of the key eligibility criteria for receiving grant funding is the assessment of reckonable income. Income details supplied by Revenue and/or Department of Social Protection for the relevant period for assessment purposes would not be available when the CAO application process opens in November.  Extending the application processing window would not necessarily increase processing efficiency and may indeed add some layers to the process.</p><p>  However, SUSI has opened earlier each year since it first came into operation in June 2012.  It opened on 23 April this year for the 2015/16 academic year. This, combined with many other ongoing improvements made by SUSI, resulted in almost 27,000 students being paid in September this year, the first time that payments have been made before October.  SUSI will continue to work to ensure that students receive decisions on their student grant applications as early as possible to assist them in making more informed decisions when they receive their CAO offers.  A Service Level Agreement between SUSI and the CAO currently provides for the direct transfer of data from the CAO to SUSI in relation to final course acceptance details for applicants who opt to have their data transferred.</p></reply>

The scale of these shortages varies and there can be a variety of reasons that impact on the ability of employers to recruit.</p><p>  The second National Employers Survey which was published last May found that three quarters of foreign employers feel that there will be an adequate supply of graduates in the next three to five years.  This is a great vote of confidence in Ireland and our education and training providers.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a worldwide demand for ICT skills and in particular for those with ICT skills and relevant industry experience. </p><p>  Given the scale of demand for ICT skills, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation launched a revised Government/Industry ICT Skills Action Plan in 2014.  The Plan takes a comprehensive approach including increases in high-level graduate output, enhancing awareness of ICT as a career among students, maintaining a strong talent pool and promoting Ireland as a destination for ICT talent. Implementation of the plan is being overseen by a high-level steering group shared by the two departments and including representatives from industry and the education system, and delivery teams have been set up to progress areas of work set out under the plan.</p><p>ICT graduate output from the higher education sector has increased significantly since the first ICT plan was published in 2011.</p><p>  As well as mainstream provision in the higher education sector, Springboard+ 2015, which incorporates the ICT skills conversion programme, is providing over 9,000 free higher education places for jobseekers who wish to upskill or reskill in areas where there are identified skills needs.  This is the largest Springboard offering to-date.</p><p>  ICT conversion courses are also open to a wide cohort of applicants given the priority in this area.</p><p>  Employment outcomes for Springboard graduates are very strong and further information on outcomes is available in the trend analysis reports published on my Department's website.</p><p>  In addition, under Momentum 6,000 free further education and training places have been made available for long-term jobseekers, on courses where there are identified skills needs.</p><p>  Following on from a comprehensive review of the Irish apprenticeship system, a major initiative is also underway to reform and expand apprenticeship.  The content of existing apprenticeships is being modernised, with new curricula being rolled out in five of the most popular trades and a curriculum review underway in the remaining trades.  A new Apprenticeship Council has been established that is prioritising the development of 25 new apprenticeships in areas such as ICT, financial services, transport and tourism and hospitality.  These new apprenticeships are being progressed following the evaluation of responses to a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  This expansion of apprenticeship will provide new options for school leavers as well as for those seeking to reskill or upskill in the labour market.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that, as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, my Department is leading on the development of a new National Skills Strategy.  The Strategy will aim to ensure that Ireland's current and future workforce needs are met through increased participation, educational attainment, skills development and skill use to achieve greater productivity and support economic and social prosperity and growth. I have invited all interested parties to contribute to the process by submitting their views, on the development of the Strategy, before Tuesday 1st December 2015.  Full details on the consultation process are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie As part of this work, my Department is also leading a project to create a network of regional skills fora to foster greater engagement between the education and training system, employers and other local stakeholders in building the skills needs of their regions.</p></reply>

It is the management authority that employs the school's teachers and other staff members.  The school principal manages the school on a day-to-day basis.</p>  <p>  As my Department has no role in the employment of staff in schools or schools' day-to-day management, a complaint about the child's school and its staff is proper to the school itself.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, my Department does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of action in regard to individual complaint cases.  In dealing with complaints, the Department's role is to provide advice to parents and students on the operation of schools' complaints procedures and to clarify for parents and pupils how grievances and complaints against schools can be progressed.</p>  <p>  Complaints from parents are often received by phone, and across all sections of my Department.  These are attended to contemporaneously in detail by telephone and are not logged.  It is therefore not possible to provide data in any accurate format as to how many complaints from parents of children attending primary school have been received in the Department.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions of a school recognised by the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions of a school has, or may have, adversely affected the child.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is also aware that it is my intention to amend Section 28 of the Education Act 1998 to require every school to have a Parent and Student Charter according to principles set down in legislation that will set a national standard.  Changing how schools engage with, listen and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of a Charter.  A core objective of the Charter will be to shift away from reacting to problems only after they give rise to grievances.  Instead the emphasis will be on improving the day-to-day experience students and their parents can expect from schools so that grievances do not arise at all or are resolved quickly and informally, and as a result having to resort to a formal grievance process should be much reduced.</p>  <p>  I plan to have this change introduced during the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015.</p></reply>

It is also permissible for a school to seek payments in respect of extra-curricular activities provided such activities are not obligatory and individual pupils can choose whether or not to participate.  No charge may be made, however, in respect of instruction in any subject of the school curriculum or for recreation or other activities where all pupils are expected to take part.</p>  <p>  The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management.  However, their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.  My Department does not require schools to report to it on the amounts involved and I have no plans to require such reporting.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published in April of this year, prohibits the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions as part of the school admission process or for continued enrolment in the school. Exceptions are provided in the case of fees charged by schools known as fee charging schools, fees charged by boarding schools for the boarding element and fees charged by schools for post leaving certificate courses insofar as those fees relate to the cost of providing such courses. </p>  <p>  I believe that schools need to be accountable to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities.  Better information for parents, including information in relation to the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that I will be looking at in the context of my Department's work on developing plans for a Parents' and Students' Charter.</p></reply>

The EGF application includes a financial plan indicating estimated expenditure by individual programme measure for a cumulative target population of 450 persons.  Budgets are estimated by specific measure rather than by particular beneficiary cohort.  As previously advised, all public beneficiary bodies are funding the cost of this EGF programme's measures from national budgets and will subsequently submit expenditure declarations at programme end.  The EGF Managing Authority in my Department has not approved any interim claims in respect of this programme.</p>  <p>  However, I understand that the take-up of the available support measures is less than anticipated with the recently published 2nd Implementation Report indicating take-up rates of 77% and 38% of the targeted former workers and NEETs respectively.  The improved economic climate resulting in a re-employment rate of some 60% at end August may be a factor which mitigates against a higher programme participation rate.  Lower than estimated take-up rates will result in lower final total expenditure.</p>  <p>  The 200 targeted NEET persons were not required to be named in the EGF application.  Two separate listings of verified NEET persons meeting the criteria under Regulation (EU) 1309/2013 of being under the age of 25 years on the date of submission of the EGF application and not being in employment, education or training, have been supplied to date by the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to my Department. Persons aged under 25 from the Dublin South and Kildare regions, being areas in reasonable proximity to the former LTAI plant, who were in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance and not working part-time or on any activation scheme were included in these listings.  These persons were duly contacted by the SOLAS EGF Co-ordination units with regard to participation in the EGF programme.</p>  <p>  The local EGF Coordination Unit office established by SOLAS and located in Tallaght is coordinating EGF programme supports.  All potential beneficiaries have been contacted by the Unit on a number of occasions and my Department is continuing to liaise with the EGF Coordination Unit and other partners to maximise engagement with the programme.  Final uptake of an EGF support measure is dependent ultimately on the individual choice of each eligible beneficiary and may be influenced by a range of factors including reintegration into part-time or full-time employment, or a focus on job searching. </p></reply>

There are currently more than 5,100 households in receipt of HAP and the scheme has been rolled out to all categories of household in 18 local authority areas.</p>  <p>  The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are generally based on the Rent Supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenging Dublin region rental market, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment)(No. 4) Regulations 2015, which provide for the introduction of HAP in Kildare County Council, from 2 November 2015, with maximum rent limits equivalent to current Rent Supplement rates applicable in South Dublin. In addition, these regulations provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum rent limits that apply for the purposes of HAP in the administrative area of Kildare County Council. </p>  <p>  I am determined to give local authorities the resources and flexibility to make the HAP scheme an effective and practical tool for meeting housing need in their area, and I am satisfied, based on careful analysis, that the current arrangements do that both in the northern part of Kildare County Council&rsquo;s administrative area and in the southern part of the count, where the rental market is less challenging. </p>  <p>  I will continue to keep HAP rent limits under review.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  The Act provides that landlords in the sector must apply to register the tenancy of a dwelling with the PRTB within one month of the commencement of the tenancy.  The PRTB actively pursues landlords for non-registration.  Failure to register tenancies can result in prosecution with fines of up to &euro;4,000 and/or six months imprisonment.</p>  <p>  There are no comprehensive figures on the size of the sector but a report by DKM economic consultants commissioned by the PRTB and published last year reported an estimated 85% compliance rate in relation to the registration of tenancies. New information systems were introduced in early 2011 to facilitate registration enforcement and to help identify unregistered landlords.  The PRTB receives information from a number of sources including the Department of Social Protection, local authorities and members of the public for this purpose.</p>  <p>  Figures for the number of landlords (170,613) and the number of tenancies (323,062) registered have both increased in 2015 to date over the 2014 levels, suggesting that the compliance rate may have improved.</p>  <p>  In 2014 the PRTB continued an active enforcement campaign against unregistered landlords.  A total of 29,293 enforcement notices/solicitor warning letters issued to landlords and 21 District Court Summons were served on landlords who failed to register their tenancies with the PRTB.</p>  <p>  Landlords of unregistered tenancies are precluded from referring a dispute to the PRTB.  Non-registration does not affect tenant rights, and tenants have access to the dispute resolution service irrespective of whether the tenancy is registered or not.</p></reply>

Landlords affected by these changes should have engaged with their tenants during this time to discuss the implications of any works that needed to be carried out on their properties.  The revised standards in the 2008 Regulations do not specifically target bedsits but were based on a review of minimum standards dating back to 1993 which tolerated very basic facilities such as external toilets, cold water only and having an open fireplace as the only heating source.  In consultation with key stakeholders including organisations representing landlords and tenant rights, such as Threshold and the IPOA, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 were drafted.  Minimum standards are necessary as a protection to all consumers and especially to the most vulnerable who may not be in a position to protect themselves adequately.   </p>  <p>  Census 2011 indicated that there were approximately 4,500 bed-sits across the country &ndash; the majority of which were in Dublin &ndash; accounting for 1% of households in the private rented sector.  In 2012, Dublin City Council commenced an intensified inspection programme, funded by my Department, specifically targeting properties likely to be at risk of non-compliance.  It found that 90 % of dwellings selected for inspection were non-compliant with the regulations on initial inspection.  It is worth emphasising that 72% of the dwellings inspected were failing on fire safety grounds.  By the end of March 2015, 73 % of the non-compliant properties had been brought into compliance resulting in improved standards for tenants in over 4,000 properties.  Enforcement action continues against the remainder, including legal action in certain cases.   </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the enforcement of minimum standards rests with local authorities.  It is important to note that the vast majority of landlords have brought their properties into line with the minimum standards.  Any remaining non-compliant bed-sits are failing on multiple grounds, including fire safety, and many are simply not fit for habitation. </p>  <p>  The improvement in basic standards of living for those in rented accommodation brought about by the 2008 Regulations has been a success.  As a result of the regulations, many more tenants are now living in safe, healthy homes.  I have no plans to amend the regulations to reduce the standards required.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Scheme was to assist in the gradual unwinding of loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme.  Applications to the value of some &euro;163 million in loans were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme.  The figure of &euro;163 million includes &euro;111 million in respect of loans which were fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme.  The remaining &euro;52 million accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme is in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  Such annuity repayments are recoupable from my Department subject to the local authority complying with the terms of the Scheme.</p><p>In 2013, as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources, and following a review of the Scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the Land Aggregation Scheme, in terms of accepting new applications, was no longer a sustainable option.  The review concluded with the issuance of Circular 35/2013 on 11 December 2013, notifying Local Authorities of the discontinuance of the Scheme in respect of new applications. </p><p>The focus of the Scheme has now shifted to the management and future utilisation of the lands included in the Scheme.

It is imperative that the sector is properly regulated in all areas of its work and that includes their landlord-tenant relationships.The current law for AHB tenancies is based on a combination of tenancy agreements, the common law, and landlord and tenant legislation dating as far back as the nineteenth century. As such, there is a need for a modern legislative basis for AHB tenancies. The application of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to AHBs will achieve this objective. It will provide real security of tenure to AHB tenants; it will clearly set out the rights and obligations of both AHB landlords and tenants; and, significantly, it will provide access to a comprehensive and independent dispute resolution service. </p><p>The rights and obligations for landlords and tenants that are laid out in sections 12 and 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act are appropriate for the not-for-profit sector and in many cases mirror the provisions of leases offered by AHB landlords. Having a common set of rights and obligations provided in statute will benefit the sector as a whole. The Residential Tenancies Act does not prevent landlords giving rights or imposing obligations<b></b>in addition to those provided for in sections 12 and 16, as long as these are consistent with the Act. </p><p>While the practice is for AHB tenants to occupy their dwellings on a long-term basis, the majority of AHB tenancies are in fact periodic tenancies. The Residential Tenancies Act will give most AHB tenants greater rights than they currently have by giving them the right to a four year tenancy under Part 4 of the Act. The entitlement to a four year tenancy is a minimum entitlement for tenants after 6 months. This does not prevent landlords providing for longer fixed-term tenancies should they wish to do so and there is nothing in the Act to prevent a landlord providing a tenant with more beneficial rights generally than those that are provided for in the Act. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act provides a base level of protection for tenants. When AHB tenancies come within the remit of the Act, AHB tenants will not lose any advantages they might have over private rented tenants; rather, they will benefit from the additional legal protection provided by the Residential Tenancies Act. </p></reply>

It is intended to have the first 150 units delivered as quickly as possible in the Dublin City Council administrative area, with the City Council acting as the contracting authority. The Council is aiming to secure the delivery of an initial fast-tracked 22 of these units by mid-December, with the remaining units to follow by late Q1 2016. A further 350 units will then be provided across the four local authorities in the Dublin region through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement.  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with the individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.

These draft revisions proposed:</p>  <p>-  the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments,</p>  <p>-  a mandatory minimum setback of 500 metres between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations, and</p>  <p>-  the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. </p>  <p>  A public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the Guidelines, which ran until 21 February 2014. My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process. It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible. In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines. My Department is advancing work on the Guidelines in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </p>  <p>  The revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts. In the interim, the 2006 Guidelines continue to apply. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, each planning authority&rsquo;s development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. </p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure including energy facilities. Section 9 of the Act further requires that a development plan be consistent with such national plans, policies or strategies as they relate to proper planning and sustainable development.   </p>  <p>  As the preparation or variation of local authority Development Plans must take account of all relevant and up to date national plans, policies and strategies, my Department advised planning authorities by way of circular letter PL 20/13 dated 20 December 2013 that until the review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines has concluded, planning authorities should defer amending their existing Development Plan policies relating to wind energy as part of either the cyclical review or variation processes. They were instead advised to continue to operate their existing Development Plan policies and objectives until the review of the Guidelines was completed.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an   independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants. Due to the quasi-judicial role of the PRTB it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any case.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas and will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, inter alia, for the introduction of a new procedure to enforce a tenant&rsquo;s obligation under section 86 of the 2004 Act to pay rent pending the determination of a dispute. Furthermore, a s part of the Government&rsquo;s recently announced package of measures in relation to the rental sector, the enforcement of PRTB determination orders will no longer have to be pursued through the Circuit Court but will be dealt with in the District Court. In general, this will provide for the faster hearing of enforcement cases and will save expense. The Bill also includes a provision to prevent a Notice of Termination from being found to be invalid on the basis of a technicality.   </p>  <p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with Committee Stage in the Seanad.   The Bill will return to the Seanad for Report and Final Stages today. </p>  <p>  Given the sustained increase in demand for PRTB services, approval was provided for an additional 9 staff and the Board is in the process of recruitment to fill these posts which will bring the number of personnel up to 42. Further resources are to be made available in the context of the implementation of the package of measures in relation to the rental sector, referred to previously.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.  Provision was made for the construction of an extension to Longford fire station in 2007 and approval-in-principle was conveyed to Longford County Council to proceed with the preparation of design drawings and a cost plan. The project progressed to tender stage in 2009, and a total of &euro;43,081 was recouped by my Department to Longford County Council in relation to fees incurred.   </p>  <p>  In 2010, given constraints on public finances and the fact that Longford County Council was also seeking financial support for the construction of a new fire station at Lanesboro, my Department requested that Longford County Council determine its order of priority in relation to both projects.   The Council confirmed in July 2010 that the Lanesboro fire station project was the number one priority on their list of capital works. The project to construct a new two-bay fire station at Lanesboro was approved in 2014 and completed this year, with my Department recouping &euro;1,011,179 to Longford County Council for costs incurred on the project.   </p>  <p>  I have also recently announced a new national joint - procurement programme to purchase twenty fire appliances, under which Longford Fire Service has been allocated one new appliance.   Given the ongoing constraints on public finances, further support from my Department&rsquo;s Fire Services Capital Programme to proceed with an extension to the fire station in Longford Town will have regard to national priorities, the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide, Longford County Council's priorities, the extent of current and previous investment in Longford fire service, the value for money offered by proposals and the status of existing facilities having regard to risk categorisation.</p></reply>

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources. Ireland aims to meet its renewable transport target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels, with increasing usage of electric vehicles also making a contribution. </p>  <p>  Ireland's third National Energy Efficiency Action Plan to 2020 estimates that approximately 50,000 electric vehicles (EVs) could form part of the transport fleet in 2020. However, the extent to which electric vehicles are adopted in the short-to-medium term will depend on a range of factors including, inter alia, the strength of the economy, the overall numbers of new cars being purchased, the cost of purchasing and running electric vehicles compared to fossil fuel comparators, and the number of different electric vehicle models available to purchase. There are signs that these factors are improving and in 2015, 541 EVs have been supported through the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme which represents over half of the total of 1,076 supported since the programme began in 2011.</p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, who administers the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme, estimate that the current fleet size is now 1,100 EVs, which will provide an annual saving of 864 tonnes CO2. 50,000 EVs operating today would deliver annual CO2 savings of 39,000 tonnes compared with the today's new fossil fuel equivalents.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent regulator.   Ahead of the introduction of the Electric Vehicles Scheme in 2011, a cost benefit analysis was undertaken in relation to electric vehicles incentives. Findings included:</p>  <p>  - Whilst Electric Vehicles have a significantly lower annual running cost, because of their higher purchase price compared with vehicles powered entirely by fossil fuels, they have a higher nominal life cycle cost; </p>  <p>  - Electric Vehicles offer major fuel efficiency gains as well as the opportunity for Ireland to exploit its renewable energy resources. Deployment of Battery EVs (BEVs) and Plug in Hybrid EVs (PHEVs) provides an opportunity to reduce the level of CO2 emissions beyond that currently possible with even the most efficient vehicles powered entirely by fossil fuels. Essentially, by shifting to EVs, the potential to energise vehicles with 100% renewable energy becomes possible.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this report was based on 6,000 EVs being grant aided between 2011 and 2012 and over 200,000 EVs forming part of the national fleet by 2020.</p></reply>

Rivers are only open to harvest fisheries where there is an exploitable surplus above the individual River's conservation limit. The conservation limit is the minimum number of spawning adults required to maintain a healthy population.    I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) that, in the case of estuaries where there is a mix of individual river stocks each river contributing to the estuary must be above its own conservation limit before harvest fishing is permitted. This is because it is not possible to disaggregate fish in a mixed stock area and the imperative to protect vulnerable individual stocks from indiscriminate fishing and avoid exploitation of those stocks within the mix that are below their conservation limit. </p>  <p>  Within the Shannon Catchment two of six rivers are open to angling and of these one is open to commercial fishing for 2015. The River Mulkear is open to angling on a catch and release basis, and the River Feale open to angling and commercial fishing as it has a sustainable surplus. There is also a catch and release stretch for angling allowed on the lower Shannon under a by-law, between O&rsquo;Brien's Bridge and Thomond Bridge for recreational angling. </p>  <p>  As the River Shannon is below its conservation limit, the Estuary is closed to commercial exploitation of salmon.</p></reply>

This All-Island Joint Research Programme is a collaborative approach between Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction and is working very well. I regard the sharing of expertise between the various State Agencies in both jurisdictions as a positive initiative. The research programme is broad in its scope, covering several environmental parameters as well as operational practice and regulatory approaches around the world. The Terms of Reference for this research programme were agreed by a broadly based Steering Committee. The draft Terms of Reference had earlier been published for consultation and more than 1,300 submissions were received. The EPA and the Steering Committee reviewed the submissions and the draft Terms of Reference were amended and strengthened after this public consultation.</p>  <p>  I understand that the contract for this programme of research was awarded following a robust evaluation process in compliance with public procurement guidelines, where the tender submitted by the winning consortium was evaluated as being the strongest bid. The constitution of the evaluation panel was approved by the project Steering Committee and included personnel with the capacity to make informed decisions on the tenders received. The evaluation panel consisted of 27 existing and retired personnel from various State agencies spanning four jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  One of the key requirements of the tender process was evidence of expertise in the field. The evaluation panel found that in this regard, that the tender led by CDM Smith provided an excellent response. The overall resourcing of the proposal included excellent legal expertise, a strong and experienced hydrogeological team, an excellent peer-review group proposed with high credibility, in addition to a seismology team which was considered to be outstanding. Work undertaken by the consortium is reviewed by the members funding the programme and external experts appointed by them.</p>  <p>  As is usual in major and broad ranging projects such as this, the project team involves a wide range of expert institutions and companies. The consortium includes CDM Smith, the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, AMEC Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors. This consortium includes commercial consultancies, academics, a geological research institution and a legal firm, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope. This broad range of experience and expertise adds to the strength of the consortium.</p>  <p>  Members of the consortium (CDM Smith, AMEC and BGS) have extensive practical experience of working for the oil and gas industry, including on UGEE projects in different countries. This experience is essential for the consortium to be able to effectively address the questions that are the subject of this Joint Research Programme.</p>  <p>  The programme of research will assist regulators, both North and South, in making informed decisions about hydraulic fracking and I believe that we should leave space for this research to report.</p></reply>

These documents outline a coherent and detailed framework within which all appraisal in the transport sector must be carried out. This ensures consistency and methodological robustness. My Department's Economic and Financial Evaluation Unit will shortly be publishing updated Guidelines and this will be published on our website.  </p>  <p>  Transport appraisal is a developed field both in Ireland and internationally. Traditionally, transport user benefits, such as travel time savings, accident reduction and emissions savings, have been captured and the methodology in this area is standard. The area of wider economic benefits is a developing one and, accordingly, is not currently a central part of the appraisal process in terms of generating Benefit to Cost Ratios (BCR). Typically appraisals will qualitatively list such impacts through a Project Appraisal Balance Sheet. Where methodology allows, appraisals do include a quantitative and modelled assessment of the wider economic benefits. However, these are typically reported in addition to the standard BCR.</p></reply>

This funding is either directly administered or delivered through local authorities and certain agencies. My Department is currently operating a Structures at Risk Fund to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund, which has an allocation of &euro;624,000 in 2015, is administered through the local authorities and encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  This fund, which is now closed, was open to two applications per local authority. My Department did not receive any formal application for funding under the Structures at Risk Fund 2015 from Longford County Council for the structure referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2015 the Council administered a community based heritage grants scheme with funding of &euro;547,000 available for projects that contribute to particular heritage themes.  While I understand that applications have closed for their 2015 scheme, the Council may be able to advise if the structure would be eligible for funding now or in the future.  The Heritage Council&rsquo;s website is .</p><p>The remainder of my Department&rsquo;s built heritage capital budget for 2015 is focused on the conservation and presentation of the State's heritage portfolio, which is managed by the Office of Public Works.</p><p>I recently announced a new &euro;2 million investment scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures.  This fund will operate in 2016, via the Local Authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS), which ran in 2014, and is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  This announcement will come as a welcome boost to the custodians of heritage properties. Local authorities are required to submit a provisional schedule of projects to my Department by 16<sup>th</sup>December 2015 and all queries in this regard should be made with the relevant local authority as applicable.</p><p>With respect to other possible funding, my Department is currently considering the funding available for the protection and conservation of the built heritage in 2016 in the context of its overall allocation and I will publish details of funding schemes for 2016 as soon as these are finalised.</p></reply>

An expert team, led by Master Shipwright and Ship Conservator, John Kearon, set out to conserve the Asgard, while retaining the structural integrity of the vessel and preserving as much of the existing original material as possible.  The historic yacht is now on exhibition in Collins Barracks, where it ties in closely with two other historical exhibitions there - <i>The Easter Rising: Understanding 1916</i>and <i>Soldiers and Chiefs:</i><i>Irish Soldiers at Home and Abroad Since 1500.</i></p><p>There are no plans at present to move the Asgard from its current location.

Natural heritage areas are designated under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and are legally protected from negative impacts from the date they are formally proposed for designation through a requirement to obtain Ministerial consent before certain potentially damaging activities are undertaken on these sites. </p><p>The criteria to which the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht shall have regard to, when publishing a notice of an intention to designate a natural heritage area, are set out in section 16(6) of the Act of 2000.</p><p>When a landowner has been refused Ministerial consent to carry out certain proposed works in a natural heritage area, a claim for compensation may be made to my Department not later than 6 months from the date of issue of the decision refusing consent. The provisions relating to compensation are set out in section 22 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000. In this regard, as there are legal proceedings ongoing, taken by the landowner referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question, it would not be appropriate for me to refer further to matters which are the subject of these proceedings.</p><p>The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, published in January 2014<i>, </i>which is available to download from my Department&rsquo;s website, provides detail on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 current raised bog natural heritage areas. The Review<i></i>has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network. This will entail the phasing out of turf cutting on certain natural heritage areas by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain natural heritage areas.</p><p>46 raised bog natural heritage areas (including parts of 7 natural heritage areas) are scheduled for de-designation. As set out in correspondence to affected persons in February 2014, restrictions on turf cutting for domestic purposes will not come into effect on these sites. However, the consent of other authorities may be required in order to undertake turf extraction on these sites in certain circumstances, for example, commercial peat extraction.</p><p>Regulatory change will be required to give full effect to the de-designation of the sites. The appropriate form of this change is being considered within my Department and I expect that the process will be completed by early 2016. </p><p>To compensate for the loss of habitat within sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can continue, 25 undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, will be designated as natural heritage areas. The current compensation arrangements for domestic turf cutters in raised bog special areas of conservation will be made available to affected turf cutters in the relevant natural heritage areas.</p><p>The necessary preparatory work in order for these sites to be proposed for designation is ongoing. This work includes the delineation of proposed boundaries, the preparation of site maps and the compilation of the details of landowners and others who may be affected by the proposed designations.</p><p>As with all designations, my Department will, in due course, directly contact individual landowners and users in the relevant areas and advertisements will be placed in local newspapers. An explanation will be given as to why a site is being proposed for designation and of the process through which individuals can appeal against the designation of their lands. </p></reply>
