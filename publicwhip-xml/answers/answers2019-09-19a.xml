The closing date is 26 June 2020 and, given the amount of preparatory work involved, I would not expect to see formal applications coming until nearer that deadline. </p>  <p>  Inclusion on the Tentative List is the first step towards nomination for World Heritage status. Immediately after the June 2020 closing date, my Department will conduct an initial screening of all proposals received before transmitting them to an expert advisory group, which will make recommendations as to which sites should be included on the new Tentative List. The Department acts as Focal Point for Ireland, as State party to the World Heritage Convention, and therefore makes the final decision in relation to the Tentative List.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service actively assists and advises applicants wishing to have sites put on the Tentative List. A number of meetings have already taken place with local authorities under this new round and information events are planned for communities with potential Tentative List sites in their areas.  My Department's policy is for applications to be sponsored by the relevant local authority or other statutory body in order to ensure continuity throughout the process. Individuals or other organisations are encouraged to apply in collaboration with the relevant local authority. The role of the local authority is crucial in order to facilitate public consultation and wider stakeholder engagement, particularly in light of the requirement under the UNESCO Operational Guidelines for participatory planning and stakeholder consultation.</p>  <p>  The most critical element when determining whether a site should be included on the Tentative List is the potential of the property to demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value, meaning that its significance is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations. The property must also meet relevant conditions of authenticity and integrity, and there must be mechanisms in place to provide for its long-term protection and management. </p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing the new Tentative List beginning to take shape in the months ahead.</p></reply>

Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  </p>  <p>  The building mentioned by the Deputy is in the ownership of the local authority, and is, in the first instance a matter for it. It is recorded in my Department&rsquo;s National Inventory of Architectural Heritage and is rated there as of Regional Importance. As such it was recommended to the local authority for inclusion in its Record of Protected Structures. </p>  <p>  As the owner of this protected structure, the local authority has a duty under the Acts to ensure the structure does not become endangered. My role in relation to protected structures is mainly advisory, officials of my Department have, however, contacted Dublin City Council to ascertain its plans and remain available to advise the Council in any future efforts to restore the building.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS), which are administered by local authorities. On Thursday 28 March, I announced funding of &euro;4.3m for 478 projects under these schemes in 2019. Details of these projects are available on my Department's website and local authority websites. I understand, however, that the scale of investment needed for the structure mentioned would mean that the levels of grant funding available under these schemes would not be sufficient.</p>  <p>  I fully understand and appreciate the value of our built heritage at a local level and I have asked officials in my Department to remain in contact with Dublin City Council on this matter.</p></reply>

This Plan is led by my Department, with the Departments of Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council, all working in partnership.</p><p>Creative Schools aims to understand, develop and celebrate the arts and creativity as a core aspect of school life. It strives to foster children and young people&rsquo;s creativity, potential and participation in the arts as an integral part of their education. The initiative recognises that the arts are a powerful means through which children and young people can explore communication and collaboration, stimulate their imaginations to be inventive, and harness their boundless curiosity.</p><p>Schools selected to participate in the programme do so on a two-year cycle - the first to support them in developing a feasible creative plan for the school, and the second to enable them to implement this plan.  Each participating school is provided with access to a Creative Associate, who are essential in embedding inspirational and sustainable creative practices in teaching and learning.  Creative Associates are a mixture of practising artists and teachers with an understanding of creativity and its potential to transform the lives of children and young people. In addition, each school is allocated an annual grant of &euro;2,000 to implement their plans.</p><p>There was significant interest in the pilot when launched in 2018 - with some 400 schools applying for 150 places.  Given this level of interest, and the positive feedback from participants, total investment in the initiative for 2019 has increased to &euro;2.36m - funded by my own Department as well as the Department of Education and Skills and the Arts Council. A second round of applications was opened in 2019 and just last week, the Minister for Education and Skills and I announced the details of a further 150 schools which have been selected to participate from this month. </p><p>The participating schools in Creative Schools from County Longford are:</p><p>- Gaelscoil an Longfoirt, Fearann U&iacute; Dhuag&aacute;in, Co Longfoirt</p><p>- St Dominic&rsquo;s National School,Kenagh, Co Longford</p><p>- Scoil Naomh Micheal, St. Mel's Road, Longford, Co Longford</p><p>The participating schools in Creative Schools from County Westmeath are:</p><p>- Ard na gCrath National School, Ard na gCraith, Walderstown, Athlone, Co Westmeath</p><p>- Naomh Mhuire, South Hill, Delvin, Co Westmeath</p><p>- SN An Cusan, An Cuasan, Castlequarter,Coosan, Athlone, Co Westmeath</p><p>- Scoil na gCeithre M&aacute;istr&iacute;, Lios U&iacute; Mhull&aacute;in, Ath Luain, Co na hIarmh&iacute;</p><p>The Creative Youth Plan is ambitious and ever developing, and I hope that by 2022 it will have touched the lives of every child and young person in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-19a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900054#WRA02100"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s 3rd assessment on the status of listed habitats and species was submitted by my Department to the European Commission in April 2019. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, 85% of habitats are reported as being in Unfavourable status. The main drivers are agricultural practices which negatively impact over 70% of habitats, particularly ecologically unsuitable grazing, abandonment and pollution. The Unfavourable status of many habitats is not surprising as this is the reason they have been listed on the Directive.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in a range of targeted activities to address these issues at regional, national and EU level, and also liaises with other departments, particularly the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to implement policy and practices which will help tackle the drivers of biodiversity loss. </p>  <p>  The status of species is somewhat better: 57% assessed as Favourable and 30% assessed as being in Unfavourable status, with 72% demonstrating stable or improving trends while just 15% demonstrated on-going declining trends. Progress is being made and a number of species such as bats, otter, pine marten and grey seal are doing well. </p>  <p>  I recently visited Boora in Co. Offaly and saw first-hand the conservation work being done by the NPWS. The Grey Partridge was on the verge of extinction in the late 1990s but following an intense programme of habitat management and nest protection, the population in the project area is now estimated to be around 800 birds today.</p>  <p>This is a remarkable story of hands-on   conservation in action and demonstrates how a strong partnership between the NPWS and the local community can lead to the reversal of loss and to species recovery.  </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing implementation of the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017-2021, in 2018 I launched a grant scheme to assist local authorities with biodiversity projects in their areas that support actions in the Plan. A grant of &euro;16,000 was made to  Offaly County Council to support a range of local authority-led biodiversity projects.  </p>  <p>Recognising the need for a coherent cross-sectoral response to the biodiversity crisis, earlier this year I announced our &lsquo;Seeds for Nature&rsquo;  , a range of commitments to be undertaken by public authorities and other stakeholders to drive implementation of actions in the Plan.</p></reply>

The scheme provides for grant funding of 75% of the total cost of a project. This year, I introduced a phased payment option of the total grant. To facilitate start-up, 30% of the funding for a project may be  payable on acceptance of the grant and meeting start up conditions. </p><p>The 2019 scheme was advertised on the website of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (<i>www.chg.gov.ie</i>), on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department (<i>www.npws.ie</i>) and through social media and media outlets. Advertisements were placed in a number of regional papers, predominately where raised bogs are a feature of that community and its landscape and . Applications were accepted for the scheme up to the end of May 2019.</p><p>Eligible applications received were assessed by a panel established by my Department based on the information submitted and under the criteria of the scheme. Recommendations were then made to me, as Minister, for funding of a number of these projects. In July 2019, I approved grant funding of just under &euro;131,000 to thirteen local community groups and organisations, with &euro;16,245 in pre-funding to be provided to seven of these groups as start-up funding. </p><p>Funding of &euro;1,500 was awarded to one local group in County Offaly,<b></b>Kilclonfert Community Hall Committee, to have a display and information on Raheenmore Bog, a raised bog special area of conservation, set up in the local community centre and to have directional signage put in place for anyone wishing to visit the bog.</p></reply>

Based on what we have been able to establish over the last 7 weeks, RHD2 appears to be widespread in Ireland. The virus is known to be highly contagious and easily spread and environmental contamination presents significant difficulties in terms of any biosecurity responses.</p>  <p>  Netting and collecting hares for coursing meetings has been identified as a significant risk factor in spreading the disease. Accordingly, I have decided to maintain the suspension of the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club to capture and tag hares for the 2019/20 hare coursing season. This decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>  The disease was first reported in Ireland from domestic rabbits in 2018 and was first reported in the wild in early August this year.  The virus has now been confirmed in Counties Clare, Cork, Leitrim, Offaly, Wicklow and Wexford with some other animals still awaiting testing.  My Department officials will continue to work closely with colleagues in the regional laboratories and virology unit of Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to gain a fuller understanding of the extent and impact of the disease in Ireland. All post-mortems and RHD2 testing to date has been done in DAFM&rsquo;s labs and I would like to acknowledge their ongoing support and cooperation in our efforts to date.</p>  <p>  While most of the confirmed reports to date have been in rabbits, the disease has also been recorded in two Irish hares.  Further hares await testing. While all locations continue to support apparently healthy wild populations, unlike the situation in the UK where mass mortalities have been reported, officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department continue to monitor the situation.</p>  <p>  The cooperation of farming groups, hunters, the coursing clubs and other rural land-users will be essential to ensure that a full picture of the disease&rsquo;s extent and spread are achieved.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, the profits or gains arising to a writer, composer, visual artist or sculptor from the publication, production or sale of his or her work is exempt from income tax.   Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 empowers Revenue to make a determination that certain artistic works are original and creative works generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Where a determination is not made in effect the application is rejected. There is a right of appeal to an independent appeal body where the Revenue declines to issue a determination. </p>  <p>  The scheme provides that Revenue can make determinations in respect of artistic works in the following categories only:</p>  <p>  1. a book or other writing</p>  <p>  2. a play</p>  <p>  3. a musical composition</p>  <p>  4. a painting or other like picture</p>  <p>  5. a sculpture.</p>  <p>  Where a determination is made by Revenue in respect of a work, income arising from that work, up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 per annum, is exempt from income tax.</p>  <p>  Any proposals to extend the Artists Tax Exemption Scheme are a matter for the Minister for Finance and while there are no plans at this point to extend the scheme, I can assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to be proactive in seeking ways to support artists. We recognise the crucial role that the arts and culture play in our nation and have made significant progress on our public commitment to double funding for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht by 2025. In Budget 2019, funding for arts and culture increased by &euro;22.6m to almost &euro;190m, an increase of 14% on 2018. Initiatives such as the review of the Percent for Arts Scheme, and Social Welfare for Self-Employed Artists which I announced earlier this year, are also providing tangible support to our valued artistic community. The latter initiative  recognises the unique creative circumstances of artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and gives them special assistance in their first year out of work, allowing them to focus on their creative output.  From this month, self-employed artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance for the first year that they are out of work can focus on their artistic work and developing their portfolio, rather than having to participate in the normal labour market activation activities. Artists eligible to apply to the scheme include actors, theatre and film directors, dancers, opera singers, set, costume and lighting designers, musicians, composers, choreographers, architects and street performers.</p></reply>

By 1986 the disease had been found in continental Europe and has since spread globally leading to significant mortality in wild populations of rabbits. </p>  <p>  In 2010, a new more virulent strain of this virus (RHD2) emerged in France. Unlike the original virus RHD2 has been shown to infect hares as well as rabbits.</p>  <p>  RHD2 was first reported in the wild in Ireland in early August 2019. In response, I immediately suspended the licenses allowing the capture of hares for coursing meetings. The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department also began a programme of surveillance across the country for diseased animals. A request for public help was also issued and the disease has now been confirmed in six counties - Cork, Clare, Leitrim, Offaly, Wicklow and Wexford. </p>  <p>  Biosecurity measures have been put in place where the disease has been discovered on state land &ndash; to date that includes the Wexford Slobs visitor centre and Scattery Island in Clare.</p>  <p>  We have yet to establish the full extent of the disease nationally. I have issued a renewed call for the public to report any suspicious mortality in rabbits and hares.

Significant local declines have been seen in Brown hares in the UK, but little is known about how this disease may play out in Irish hares.</p>  <p>  Although the majority of confirmed cases to date have been in rabbits, the disease has also been found in hares.

In 2019, funding of &euro;339 million was allocated for developing culture, heritage and the Irish language.  This is an increase of &euro;36 million, or 12%, on the previous year.  This compares with a 5% increase in overall voted public expenditure in 2019.</p><p>The Government's priorities in relation to arts expenditure are evident with the following initiatives:</p><p>- The Taoiseach's commitment to double funding over a ten year period;</p><p>- The 13% increase in funding for my Department in this year's Estimates;</p><p>- The &euro;6.8 million 10% increase in funding for the Arts Council;</p><p>- An increase of &euro;1.15m for Creative Ireland;</p><p>- Funding of &euro;4.6m for Culture Ireland;</p><p>- The &euro;1.2bn in capital funding for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht over the ten years 2028 announced as part of the National Development Plan; including:</p><p>- The &euro;460m investment programme in our National Cultural Institutions; and</p><p>- A &euro;200m Audio-visual Action plan by me launched last summer.</p><p>In addition to these funding increases, I recently announced an increase in the Percent for Arts Scheme in which many artists have received high profile commissions for public art works.</p><p>My Department and I will continue to work rigorously with all of my Government colleagues towards delivering on the commitment to increase Government spending in the arts and culture sector.  In this context, I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department.</p><p>Artists deserve our full support particularly given the significant income challenges they can face. With regards to artists' pay and conditions, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the recent announcement by Minister O' Doherty and myself to extend the Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists on Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance on a permanent basis to other self-employed professional artists such as those working in theatre and music. This scheme recognises the unique creative circumstances of professional artists in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and gives them special assistance in their first year out of work, allowing them to focus on their creative output.</p><p>In addition to this, my Department has also worked to address conditions and employment rights in the performing arts and screen industry in conjunction with the relevant agencies under its remit. Central to this is the Arts Council policies on the remuneration of artists which strives to ensure that organisations in receipt of Arts Council funding offer fair and equitable remuneration to artists.</p><p>The Government will continue to give consideration to measures to further deliver on its commitments but will balance supports to ensure that they are felt across the sector.</p></reply>

I will seek to continue to appropriately resource the programme over the coming period through the annual budgetary estimates process.</p>  <p>  Building on the success of the commemorative programme to date, local authorities, our national cultural institutions, trade unions, the media, institutions of learning, and custodians of records, together with creative communities, will all have a leading role in supporting the national conversation about the events of this period and encouraging respectful and authentic engagement, debate and analysis. </p>  <p>  I am mindful of the challenges that we face in remembering, in a historically authentic, respectful, measured and inclusive way, the difficult and often deeply personal events that took place on the road to the foundation of the State and in remembering all of those who suffered and who lost their lives during this time.  </p>  <p>  My objective is to ensure that in remembering this complex period in our history, which includes the Struggle for Independence, the Civil War, the Foundation of the State and Partition, we promote a deeper understanding of the significance of these events, which accepts that the shared historical experience of those years gave rise to very different narratives and memories.  It will also take account of sensitivities across communities in Northern Ireland and will continue to recognise that very different perspectives persist on many of these events.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing specific proposals for a co-ordinated, cross-governmental commemorative programme for 2020 and indicative plans for the remainder of the Decade of Centenaries.  This work will continue to be informed and supported by the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations and developed in consultation with the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations.

As budgetary negotiations are ongoing I am not in a position to comment in detail on my Department's 2020 budget allocation.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform has recently announced that Budget 2020 will be based on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit. Against that background, my Department will, within the resources available in 2020, continue to place emphasis on core functions and services, including measures to:</p>  <p>- maintain the momentum created across the arts and culture sphere by initiatives funded by, or through, my Department, consistent with the Taoiseach's commitment to double the funding to the sector by 2025 allowing my Department to build on the increased funding received in the 2019 Budget of 10% in respect of the Arts Council, 11% in respect of Screen Ireland, 19% in respect of Creative Ireland as well as over &euro;2 million additional funding secured in respect of our National Cultural Institutions who welcome more than 3.5 million visitors annually;</p>  <p>- to conserve and manage our heritage as a support to economic renewal and sustainable employment, in compliance with legal obligations and to conserve and restore biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland to focus on the environment;</p>  <p>- further advance the statutory demand-led Language Planning Process and ensure continued access to our islands;</p>  <p>- promote North-South co-operation, particularly in the context of An Foras Teanga and Waterways Ireland; and</p>  <p>- deliver on Project Ireland 2040 which gave explicit recognition to the importance of our culture, language and heritage to our sustainable development over the next decade and beyond. This recognition is underpinned by the commitment by Government to invest almost &euro;1.2 billion in our culture, language and heritage over the 10-year implementation of the NDP. Project Ireland 2040   provides for an investment of &euro;460 million in the National Cultural Institutions, &euro;265 million for a culture and creativity investment programme, &euro;285 million in our natural and built heritage and &euro;178 million to support and protect the Irish language, Gaeltacht communities and communities on our offshore islands.</p></reply>

The total grant allocation this year through the fund will be &euro;370,000. It will be awarded to 56 organisations covering each county in Ireland to tackle biodiversity loss within their community.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that my Department was able to participate in such a scheme which provides grants to help communities develop local biodiversity plans. Biodiversity loss is a pressing issue and it is important that every sector of society plays its role. The fund is an example of how Government, communities and philanthropy have come together to create real, on the ground impact. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants are awarded grants from &euro;5,000 to &euro;10,000 to conduct local biodiversity studies with a trained ecologist and to engage others in the area, including farmers, to get a clear picture of the biodiversity needs in their communities. Future involvement in this scheme will be considered by my Department as part of its normal budgetary estimates process.  </p>  <p>In addition, as part of the Seeds for Nature which I announced earlier this year at the National Biodiversity Conference, my Department has expanded on the existing scheme of National Biodiversity Action Plan grants to local authorities to assist them in funding locally led biodiversity projects and to raise awareness of biodiversity issues at local level. A total of &euro;500,000 has been made available to 28 local authorities who applied in 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding each year to An Taisce to support the biodiversity component of their successful Green Schools programme. I place great value on this programme and its importance in introducing young people to engagement with biodiversity at an early age.</p>  <p>  Biodiversity Week takes place annually in May, to coincide with the UN International Day for Biological Diversity. My Department provides funding each year to the Irish Environmental Network to run a series of events and activities at a local level, aiming to engage citizens in biodiversity and raise awareness across communities.   </p>  <p>  I will continue to look at ways in which targeted funding can be made available to promote and assist biodiversity awareness and locally-led projects in the context of resources available to my Department and the demands on those resources.</p></reply>

The main drivers are agricultural practices which negatively impact over 70% of habitats, particularly ecologically unsuitable grazing, abandonment and pollution. The Unfavourable status of many habitats is not surprising as this is the reason they have been listed on the Directive.</p><p>My Department is engaged in a range of targeted activities to address these issues at regional, national and EU level, and also liaises with other departments, particularly the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to implement policy and practices which will help tackle the drivers of biodiversity loss. </p><p>The status of species is somewhat better: 57% assessed as Favourable and 30% assessed as being in Unfavourable status, with 72% demonstrating stable or improving trends while just 15% demonstrated on-going declining trends. Progress is being made and a number of species such as bats, otter, pine marten and grey seal are doing well. </p><p>As part of the ongoing implementation of the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017-2021, in 2018 I launched a grant scheme to assist local authorities with biodiversity projects in their areas that support actions in the Plan and this scheme has been expanded in 2019 with an increased level of funding.  </p><p>Recognising the need for a coherent cross-sectoral response to the biodiversity crisis, earlier this year I announced our <i>&lsquo;Seeds for Nature&rsquo;</i>, a range of commitments to be undertaken by public authorities and other stakeholders to drive implementation of actions in the Plan.</p><p>Climate and biodiversity are inexorably linked and climate change will exacerbate the impact of pressures with peatland, coastal and freshwater systems. My Department is currently finalising  a sectorial Climate Change Adaptation Plan for Biodiversity as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall climate change adaptation strategy. </p><p>Biodiversity underpins all aspects of our lives and society. Halting biodiversity loss is not simply a matter for a single agency or department. However, my Department is the lead for implementation of biodiversity policy in Ireland and takes this responsibility very seriously and will continue to work across a range of areas, engaging across sectors, to tackle biodiversity loss.</p></reply>

The cumulative impact of these funding increases is testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the arts, culture and heritage sector. </p><p>My Department and I will continue to work rigorously with all of my Government colleagues towards delivering on the commitment to increase Government spending in the arts and culture sector.  I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department.</p><p>Primary support for the arts is delivered through the Arts Council. Funding for the Arts Council has increased in recent years and now stands at &euro;75 million in 2019, and increase of some &euro;6.8m or 10% over 2018. The Arts Council operates within a published 10 year strategic framework entitled <i>Making Great Art Work </i>which prioritises support for artists throughout their careers. </p><p>The remit of Culture Ireland, a division of my Department, is to promote and advance Irish arts worldwide thus strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s cultural profile and global. The work of Culture Ireland is focused not just on promoting Ireland but also increasing career opportunities for Irish artists.</p><p>In tandem with securing additional funding, my Department has also worked to address conditions and employment rights in the performing arts and screen industry in conjunction with the relevant agencies under its remit.  In that context, the Deputy may be aware that the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is undertaking an audit of the independent film and television drama production sector with a view to examining industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedures, assessing issues arising (if any), and making recommendations for their improvement where appropriate.  In this regard, the WRC has invited submissions on these matters by 31 October, 2019.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Government published a Contingency Action Plan in December 2018 setting out its approach to dealing with a no-deal Brexit with an updated report launched in July 2019.  In addition, in May this year, the Irish and UK Governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding reaffirming a joint commitment to the Common Travel Area (CTA), and to maintaining the associated rights and privileges of Irish and British citizens under this long-standing arrangement. However, Brexit is a major strategic challenge to Ireland as a whole and there remains a range of potential outcomes that depend on the exact nature of the future relationship between the UK and Europe. With 6 weeks to go until a possible no deal Brexit, it is vital that the film and television industry, like all others, step up preparations. </p>  <p>  In relation specifically to the cultural sector, the Government has increased investment in arts and culture in recent years in part as a mitigation measure against Brexit. This includes funding of over &euro;20m for Screen Ireland in 2019 as part of a &euro;200m Audiovisual Action Plan. A key recommendation of the Audiovisual Action Plan was that Ireland should sign up the revised European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production which would allow a straightforward mechanism of facilitating potential co-productions which would otherwise not be feasible. In May this year, Ireland signed and ratified the treaty which has also been signed by the UK. While it has not yet ratified the revised Convention, the decision by the UK to sign it has been regarded by some as symbolic of its determination to continued cooperation with European countries, and other international territories, on a multilateral basis in the audiovisual sector, regardless of the outcome of Brexit. The UK will still remain members of the Council of Europe and will therefore still be parties to the European Convention on Cinematographic Coproduction, the treaty under which most European Co-productions involving Screen Ireland funding are made. </p>  <p>  It is possible the Brexit will offer opportunities to Ireland as the only major English-language market that will remain in the EU and, in that regard, my Department, through its role in implementing the Audiovisual Action Plan, continues its work to support the Government&rsquo;s ambition to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation.</p></reply>

This Plan is led by my Department, with the Departments of Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council, all working in partnership.</p>  <p>  Creative Schools aims to understand, develop and celebrate the arts and creativity as a core aspect of school life. It strives to foster children and young people&rsquo;s creativity, potential and participation in the arts as an integral part of their education. The initiative recognises that the arts are a powerful means through which children and young people can explore communication and collaboration, stimulate their imaginations to be inventive, and harness their boundless curiosity.</p>  <p>  Schools selected to participate in the programme do so on a two-year cycle - the first to support them in developing a feasible creative plan for the school, and the second to enable them to implement this plan.  Each participating school is provided with access to a Creative Associate, who are essential in embedding inspirational and sustainable creative practices in teaching and learning.  Creative Associates are a mixture of practising artists and teachers with an understanding of creativity and its potential to transform the lives of children and young people. In addition, each school is allocated an annual grant of &euro;2,000 to implement their plans.</p>  <p>  There was significant interest in the pilot when launched in 2018 - with some 400 schools applying for 150 places.  Given this level of interest, and the positive feedback from participants, total investment in the initiative for 2019 has increased to &euro;2.36m - funded by my own Department as well as the Department of Education and Skills and the Arts Council. A second round of applications was opened in 2019 and just last week, the Minister for Education and Skills and I announced the details of a further 150 schools which have been selected to participate from this month. </p>  <p>   The participating schools in Creative Schools from County Sligo are:</p>  <p>  Carraroe National School, An Ceathru Rua, Sligeach</p>  <p>  Killaville National School, Killavil, Ballymote, Co Sligo</p>  <p>  St. Cecilia's School, Cregg, Co Sligo.</p></reply>

This project is important for the border region with potential to stimulate economic activity, giving a much needed boost to job creation and with the growth in water based tourism helping to attract significant numbers of visitors to the area.  This is increasingly significant in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  Government approval for Phase 1 of this project, to restore a 2.5 km stretch of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne in County Fermanagh to the International Scout Centre at Castle Saunderson near Belturbet in Co. Cavan, was secured in February 2015.</p>  <p>  In relation to Phase 1, work is nearing completion and includes dredging works to the River Finn, construction of a new navigation arch at Derrykerrib Bridge and installation of a new mooring facility at Castlesaunderson.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;260,000 has been allocated towards the restoration of the Ulster Canal in 2019.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland anticipates expenditure of &euro;160,000 to complete payment for works at Derrykerrib and &euro;100,000 for construction works for Castlesaunderson public moorings. </p>  <p>  The expenditure to date, including commitments amounts to &euro;3,960,000 which is fully funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland is also working with Cavan County Council in relation to the development of recreational amenities at Castlesaunderson, including a new moorings facility. The contract for this project has been awarded with completion of the works expected in October 2019.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Ulster Canal Phase II, Restoration of Ulster Canal Lough Erne to Clones &ndash; The Clones Terminus Project is under development with an anticipated cost of &euro;433,000 of which 75% is funded from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, with 25% funded by my Department. </p>  <p>  This project is currently in preparation for planning if required, with a tender under assessment for a feasibility study relating to a sustainable water supply and a tender under preparation for a study relating to a master development plan for the proposed site.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland is also continuing work with the partners Monaghan County Council, Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, East Border Region Ltd. and Mid Ulster District Council to develop 22km of greenway along the Ulster Canal towpath from Smithborough, Co. Monaghan to Middletown, Co. Armagh, funded through the successful application to the Interreg VA sustainable transport measure (circa &euro;5.0m).</p>  <p>  Design work is ongoing in preparation for planning and the group have also completed development proposals for a Greenway strategy exploring how the Ulster Canal Greenway could form the spine of a network of off road Greenways across this rural border region.</p></reply>

Ireland signed up to the Agreement in 2003.   The agreement includes a commitment that &ldquo;Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables."  This is because there is slow accumulation of lead from shot in wetlands where hunting occurs.  The lead is generally harmful in the environment and can also be consumed by wildfowl which often swallow small pieces of hard materials such as gravel and the like, to assist the maceration of vegetable matter in their gizzard.  My Department&rsquo;s position is to support the AEWA commitment to phase out the use of lead shot over wetlands.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission have published an initial draft Regulation for consideration by Member States on the use of lead shot in wetlands following a report on the matter by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).   It is my understanding that the proposal, should it ultimately progress into law, would make provision for a lead-in time to facilitate the making of arrangements to source alternatives to lead shot.  It is Ireland's understanding the majority of Member States currently have some restrictions on the use of lead shot over wetlands.</p>  <p>  The Department is aware that the ban on using lead in gunshot would provide a range of difficulties to transition to new guns/gunshot for many gun owners in Ireland, including farmers and hunters.  In those Member States which do have some restrictions, many gun owners would already have guns with non-lead shot ammunition.  This would not be the case in Ireland where a considerable number of gun owners would have to make alternative arrangements, in many cases to purchase new guns.  </p>  <p>  Discussions with the REACH Committee (which is within the remit of the ECHA), are ongoing.   Ireland is represented on the Committee by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), and will be requesting a lead-in time of sufficient length for the implementation of the Regulation.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the huge voluntary commitment by all concerned.  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Deputy herself for her genuine and unstinting dedication to the work of the Group and, in particular, her support for the traders on Moore Street. </p>  <p>  Among the recommendations in the MSAG's report are that:</p>  <p>- there is an urgent need to secure the fabric of the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and that the MSAG confirms its support for the OPW to carry out this process as soon as possible;</p>  <p>- my Department should develop a scoping document on the potential for an increased State and State supported heritage and culture presence in the area;</p>  <p>- an expert group should be appointed by Dublin City Council to lead the urgent regeneration of the Moore Street market; and</p>  <p>- the MSAG should be reconfigured to a smaller more focussed group in order to move the process forward as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway on all of these recommendations. In particular, I can confirm that I have written to Dublin City Council to ask it to act on the recommendation for the expert group to lead the regeneration of the street market which I understand was discussed at the Council&rsquo;s monthly meeting on Monday, 2 September.  </p>  <p>  I look forward to the Advisory Group moving on to the next phase of its task and to seeing this part of the centre of our capital city restored to its former glory and in a manner which is sensitive to the memory and courage of the men and women and to the events of 1916.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-19a.107.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900056#WRC00400"><p>The siege of Jadotville was a prominent event that occurred during Ireland's peacekeeping mission in the Congo in September 1961. "A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  </p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board did not award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of "A" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include:</p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006.</p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006.</p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.</p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.</p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognize the brave actions of these men.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.</p></reply>

The NDP provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period 2018 to 2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. The replacement of the Air Corps  CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft is among the projects included for funding. There will be no expenditure on the project until a contract is awarded.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Act provides that specific categories of Designated Public Officials (&ldquo;DPOs&rdquo;) are subject to a one-year &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period, during which they cannot engage in lobbying activities in specific circumstances, or be employed by, or provide services to, a person carrying on lobbying activities in specific circumstances.</p>  <p>  The relevant DPOs for whom a &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period applies are Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State, Special Advisers appointed under section 11 of the Public Services Management Act 1997 and public servants prescribed as a DPO by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform under section 6(2) of the Regulation of Lobbying Act, such as Secretary General, Second Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Assistant Secretary or Director. A list of current DPOs is maintained on the website of my department.</p>  <p>  The cooling-off period is a statutory requirement and applies for the full one-year term unless the relevant DPO applies to the Standards in Public Office Commission for consent to waive or reduce their cooling-off period. It is the responsibility of the relevant DPO to seek consent prior to taking up an offer of employment (or to provide services). Statistics on the number of applications for consent under section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 are included in the annual Regulation of Lobbying report published by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour sets out further guidance on the acceptance of outside appointments and of consultancy engagement following resignation or retirement (Section 20). Civil Servants who hold positions which are &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; for purposes of the Ethics Acts shall not, within twelve months of resigning or retiring from the service, accept an offer of appointment from an employer outside the Civil Service or accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest, without first obtaining approval from the appropriate authority. Officers below Assistant Secretary level must apply to the Secretary General or Head of Office in which they are serving, or have last served before retirement or resignation. Officers at and above Assistant Secretary level must apply to the Outside Appointments Board.</p>  <p>  All civil servants who resign or retire from my Department are informed in writing of their obligations under section 20 of the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, and the relevant legislation including the Official Secrets Act. </p>  <p>  Any application from a former civil servant must be made to the appropriate authority as outlined above and would be dealt with on an individual basis and would not be collated by my Department.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Act provides that specific categories of Designated Public Officials (&ldquo;DPOs&rdquo;) are subject to a one-year &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period, during which they cannot engage in lobbying activities in specific circumstances, or be employed by, or provide services to, a person carrying on lobbying activities in specific circumstances.</p>  <p>  The relevant DPOs for whom a &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period applies are Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State, Special Advisers appointed under section 11 of the Public Services Management Act 1997 and public servants prescribed as a DPO by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform under section 6(2) of the Regulation of Lobbying Act, such as Secretary General, Second Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Assistant Secretary or Director. </p>  <p>  The cooling-off period is a statutory requirement and applies for the full one-year term unless the relevant DPO applies to the Standards in Public Office Commission for consent to waive or reduce their cooling-off period. It is the responsibility of the relevant DPO to seek consent prior to taking up an offer of employment (or to provide services). Statistics on the number of applications for consent under section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 are included in the annual Regulation of Lobbying report published by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour sets out further guidance on the acceptance of outside appointments and of consultancy engagement following resignation or retirement (Section 20). Civil Servants who hold positions which are &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; for purposes of the Ethics Acts shall not, within twelve months of resigning or retiring from the service, accept an offer of appointment from an employer outside the Civil Service or accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest, without first obtaining approval from the appropriate authority. Officers below Assistant Secretary level must apply to the Secretary General or Head of Office in which they are serving, or have last served before retirement or resignation. Officers at and above Assistant Secretary level must apply to the Outside Appointments Board.</p>  <p>  Records are not maintained of officers who have applied to my Department for such approval.</p></reply>

The maximum rate of charge for such individuals at that time was 4%, irrespective of the level of their income, unless they had non-PAYE income (such as investment or self-employment income) in excess of &euro;100,000 for a tax year, in which case the maximum rate was increased to 7% on the amount of non-PAYE income in excess of &euro;100,000.   </p>  <p>  In Budget 2013, due to the prevailing budgetary constraints and the need to raise revenue, the Government decided that the reduced rates of USC for those aged 70 years and over and for medical card holders would be available only to those with annual income of up to &euro;60,000, with effect from 1 January 2013. It is important to point out that this measure ensures equity between all citizens with incomes in excess of &euro;60,000, while ensuring that those aged over 70 and medical card holders on more modest incomes do not suffer the higher rates of USC. While step effects are never ideal, they are often a feature of tax systems with exemption thresholds, as the application of a tax on this basis allows those with incomes below the threshold to be supported by means of the exemption, while also achieving the required yield from the tax.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that the State Contributory Pension and the State Non-Contributory Pension are not chargeable to Universal Social Charge (USC) or Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, other taxation supports for the over 65s may apply depending on the personal circumstances of the individual. They include the Age Tax Credit which is available to all individuals aged 65 or over who do not qualify for an exemption from income tax. This credit is currently set at &euro;245 for single individuals or &euro;490 for a married couple or civil partners.</p>  <p>  In addition, as a result of changes in the last five Budgets, USC rates have been reduced to 0.5%, 2% and 4.5%.  The income level at which taxpayers begin to pay the higher rate of tax has also been increased by &euro;2,500 and there have been increases in both the Home Carer Tax Credit and the Earned Income Credit.  The impact of these changes is that the top marginal rate on incomes up to &euro;70,000 has been reduced from 52% to 48.5%, with fewer people on incomes around the national average having any income subject to the 40% rate of income tax.</p></reply>

As with other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences such as failure to submit returns or other documentation or the provision of false information. Section 38 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for the imposition of surcharges for the late payment of Local Property Tax. </p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, a person is penalised for the late submission (or non-submission) of an income tax return by the imposition of a surcharge on his or her income tax liability. However, a person who has submitted his or her income tax return on time can also be liable to an income tax surcharge in respect of the late submission of his or her LPT return or the failure to pay LPT.  Where a liable person has not submitted his or her LPT return by the time that he or she submits an income tax return, the income tax liability is increased by 10% up to a maximum increase of &euro;63,485.  Where the LPT return is subsequently submitted and the associated LPT liability is paid, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability. </p>  <p>  Revenue can require employers and pension providers to mandatorily deduct LPT at source from a person&rsquo;s wages or pension, where the person fails to comply with his or her LPT obligations. </p>  <p>  As such an enforcement option can apply in the case of PAYE taxpayers, it is considered that linking non-compliance with LPT by self-employed persons with a surcharge on their income tax liabilities is both fair and proportionate. The challenge of compliance is particularly significant for LPT owing to the nature of the tax itself and the wide demographic liable for the tax, a significant proportion of which are not taxpayers to whom the standard collection and enforcement methods could be applied. </p>  <p>  Given the level of LPT liability for most property owners, the application of a 10% surcharge on a person&rsquo;s LPT liability alone would be unlikely to act as an effective deterrent to non-compliance.  As I have already stated, having incurred a surcharge, a self-employed person has the opportunity to cap the surcharge at the amount of the LPT liability due by submitting an LPT return and/or paying the LPT liability.</p></reply>

The review found there is a lack of competitiveness in the sector and that if the 9% rate were to be increased, this would likely not materially impact demand or employment in the sector.</p>  <p>  The review found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than to price changes. The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  Growth is also expected to continue in the medium term. This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the sectors to which the 9% VAT rate applies remains strong.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners also published a report on the 9% VAT Rate in June 2018 which analyses the output and employment impact of the 9% VAT rate using Revenue data. The analysis found an estimated increase in employment of on average 1.8 employees for each firm benefitting from the reduced rate in the accommodation and food sector in the year following the introduction of the reduced rate. However, beyond the short term, they were unable to distinguish the impact of the rate on employment from the impact of other factors in the economy.</p>  <p>  Given the impact of an increase in the VAT rate on the hospitality sector has only recently been reviewed by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, there does not seem to currently be a case for reviewing the impact of the increase. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will appreciate that any reduction in VAT rates incurs a cost to the exchequer, which would necessitate recovery elsewhere.</p></reply>

IFRS 9 specifies how an entity should classify and measure financial assets, financial liabilities, and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items.

The reason is that there are currently no data available that would enable such calculations to be made. The Deputy will be aware that in Finance Bill 2018 I re-imposed an upper salary ceiling of &euro;1 million on the relief with effect of 1 January 2019 for new entrants and for existing beneficiaries of the programme from 1 January 2020. Such data as are available within the system relate to years before 2019 (no cap existed between 2015 and 2019). It would therefore be necessary to assess the cost-saving impact of the cap as well as taking account of evolution in the take up of the relief during the current year in order to begin to estimate the savings or costs that might arise in 2020 or subsequent years.  Also, the further ahead we seek to look, the more speculative such estimates are likely to be as assumptions for one year are placed on top of those for the preceding year.</p><p>In accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines, SARP is currently the subject of an independent review, carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. The review exercise affords an opportunity to look at all elements of the relief and it also includes consultation with stakeholders.  I understand that the report is currently being finalised and I expect that it will be submitted to me shortly. I hope to publish the report in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Act provides that specific categories of Designated Public Officials (&ldquo;DPOs&rdquo;) are subject to a one-year &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period, during which they cannot engage in lobbying activities in specific circumstances, or be employed by, or provide services to, a person carrying on lobbying activities in specific circumstances.</p>  <p>  The relevant DPOs for whom a &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period applies are Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State, Special Advisers appointed under section 11 of the Public Services Management Act 1997 and public servants prescribed as a DPO by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform under section 6(2) of the Regulation of Lobbying Act, such as Secretary General, Second Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Assistant Secretary or Director. A list of current DPOs is maintained on the website of my department.</p>  <p>  The cooling-off period is a statutory requirement and applies for the full one-year term unless the relevant DPO applies to the Standards in Public Office Commission for consent to waive or reduce their cooling-off period. It is the responsibility of the relevant DPO to seek consent prior to taking up an offer of employment (or to provide services). Statistics on the number of applications for consent under section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 are included in the annual Regulation of Lobbying report published by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour sets out further guidance on the acceptance of outside appointments and of consultancy engagement following resignation or retirement (Section 20). Civil Servants who hold positions which are &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; for purposes of the Ethics Acts shall not, within twelve months of resigning or retiring from the service, accept an offer of appointment from an employer outside the Civil Service or accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest, without first obtaining approval from the appropriate authority. Officers below Assistant Secretary level must apply to the Secretary General or Head of Office in which they are serving, or have last served before retirement or resignation. Officers at and above Assistant Secretary level must apply to the Outside Appointments Board.</p>  <p>  I have had no request from Officers below Assistant Secretary level.</p></reply>

These ceilings are inclusive of pre-committed expenditure of &euro;0.5 billion per annum for demographics in the areas of Health, Social Protection and Education. These are primary areas of current expenditure that are particularly impacted by demographic pressures. These demographic projections are informed by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) paper &lsquo;Budgetary Impacts of Changing Demographics 2017 &ndash; 2027.&rsquo; The paper can be found on the IGEES website here:</p><p><i></i>. </p><p>This paper covers a number of areas of expenditure, including pensions, child benefit, education provision and health schemes such as the Nursing Home Support Scheme. These pure demographic costs are factored in to Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings for Health, Social Protection and Education.

However, as part of the 2019 Spending Review process, an update of this paper is due to be published. This forthcoming paper will again look at the key areas of Health, Social Protection and Education and will examine demographic pressures in these areas over a ten year period. </p><p>The Department of Finance publication 'Population Ageing and the Public Finances in Ireland' published in 2018, and which can be found on the gov.ie website here <i></i>, may also be useful in examining the area of demographics. There is also some demographic information presented in the Stability Programme Update, which was published in April, such as Table 24 in chapter 8, which outlines long-term spending projections of age-related expenditure as a share of GNI*.</p></reply>

Section 22 of the Act provides that specific categories of Designated Public Officials (&ldquo;DPOs&rdquo;) are subject to a one-year &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period, during which they cannot engage in lobbying activities in specific circumstances, or be employed by, or provide services to, a person carrying on lobbying activities in specific circumstances.</p>  <p>  The relevant DPOs for whom a &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period applies are Ministers of the Government and Ministers of State, Special Advisers appointed under section 11 of the Public Services Management Act 1997 and public servants prescribed as a DPO by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform under section 6(2) of the Regulation of Lobbying Act, such as Secretary General, Second Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Assistant Secretary or Director. A list of the current DPOs in my Department is maintained on the departmental website.</p>  <p>  The cooling-off period is a statutory requirement and applies for the full one-year term unless the relevant DPO applies to the Standards in Public Office Commission for consent to waive or reduce their cooling-off period. It is the responsibility of the relevant DPO to seek consent prior to taking up an offer of employment (or to provide services). Statistics on the number of applications for consent under section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 are included in the annual Regulation of Lobbying report published by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour sets out further guidance on the acceptance of outside appointments and of consultancy engagement following resignation or retirement (Section 20). Civil Servants who hold positions which are &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; for purposes of the Ethics Acts shall not, within twelve months of resigning or retiring from the service, accept an offer of appointment from an employer outside the Civil Service or accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest, without first obtaining approval from the appropriate authority. Officers occupying &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; below Assistant Secretary level must apply for this approval to the Secretary General or Head of Office in which they are serving, or have last served before retirement or resignation. No requests for such approval have been received from officers occupying &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; since the foundation of my Department in July 2011. Officers occupying &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; at and above Assistant Secretary level must apply for this approval to the Outside Appointments Board.</p></reply>

In meeting this commitment, additional funding of &euro;7m was secured in Budgets 2017 and 2018 to facilitate the reinstatement of full maintenance grants from September 2017, for the most disadvantaged postgraduate students. This benefitted circa 1,000 postgraduate students who met the eligibility criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant and reversed the budgetary cut that was imposed on this cohort of students in 2012.</p>  <p>  The statutory based Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations are reviewed annually by my Department, following consultation with various stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations for the 2019/20 academic year, were published on 11 April 2019. </p>  <p>  With regard to the application of the distance criterion, the measurement criteria have not changed for the 2019/20 academic year. The measurement of the distances relating to the award of adjacent or non-adjacent rates of student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. The distance measurement for student grant rates is governed by Article 27(3)(a) and (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2019. This provides that the relevant distance will be measured in line with agreed guidelines. </p>  <p>  The guidelines require that the shortest most direct route between the applicant's normal residence and the institution being attended should apply. In determining the shortest most direct route, the relevant awarding authority shall establish:</p>  <p>  - the method for measuring a route; and</p>  <p>  - the factors to be taken into account in establishing and measuring a route. </p>  <p>  SUSI has progressively introduced a number of measures that are intended to make the Student Grant Scheme more efficient for students. One of these measures is the introduction of Eircode which has helped to reduce processing times for applicants. </p>  <p>  However, the actual calculation of distance from a student's home to college has not changed from previous years, and SUSI continues to use google maps to calculate distance.</p></reply>

Schools are permitted to regard capitation and ancillary grants as a combined grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a 5% increase in capitation funding was provided for Primary and Post-Primary schools that will apply from the start of the 2019/20 school year.  </p>  <p>  Responsibility for procurement of an external accountant/auditor and payment of same rests with the Board of Management in respect of schools operated by them.  Boards of Management should take a proactive approach when it comes to sourcing accountancy services in order to ensure best value is obtained and to ensure compliance with public procurement procedures.

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Mounted Unit is based at &Aacute;ras an Uachtarain, Phoenix Park, Dublin 8. The unit has a national remit under the direction and control of the Assistant Commissioner, Roads Policing and Major Event Management and the operational control of the Superintendent, Operational Support Services. There are currently 13 horses attached to the Garda Mounted Unit. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the cost of doubling the number of horses in the Unit, by increasing the number of horses to 26, would be approximately &euro;78,000.  This represents the estimated cost for the purchase of the horses only and does not include other costs including those which would arise in relation to equipment, training or personnel. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Dog Unit is based at Kilmainham Garda Station, in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) and has a national remit. I am pleased to confirm that dog units have also been established in the Southern Region based at Togher Garda Station, Cork, and Henry Street Garda Station, Limerick. I understand that facilities for a future regional dog unit have also been included in the Western Region Garda Headquarters, Galway. </p>  <p>  I am informed that there are currently 23 dogs attached to the Garda Dog Unit, comprising general purpose (search), drugs and explosive detection dogs. The cost of purchasing Garda Dogs vary from &euro;1500 - &euro;3000 in respect of a German Shepherd and from &euro;1000 - &euro;1500 for a Springer Spaniel.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that depending on the number of each breed involved, the cost up to &euro;46,000 to double the number of dogs in the Unit by purchasing an additional 23 dogs. This represents I understand that the duration and cost of training for dogs in the Garda Dog Unit varies depending on what purpose the dog in question will be used for and that training of Garda dogs is provided in house.</p>  <p>  While the costs set out above are an estimate of purchase price only, I am advised by the Garda authorities that doubling the number of dogs and horses in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would require a significant increase in Garda personnel in both units and would also significantly raise the ongoing running costs of both units, including veterinary, feed and kennelling costs.  </p>  <p>  I am further advised that the doubling of both units would also require capital investment in terms of accommodation, stables and kennels at each location. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicate that the stables at &Aacute;ras An &Uacute;achtar&aacute;in are currently at maximum capacity, as are kennelling facilities at Kilmainham Garda Station.</p></reply>

This would be rather than the domicile requirement which applies to divorces granted in non-EU states. This provision will be brought into operation only if and when the UK withdraws from the EU without an agreement.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Bill has been submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality for pre-legislative scrutiny and to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for me to predict the outcome of the legislative process with regard to this or any other Bill.  However, my aim is that the Bill will be enacted as soon as possible this year.</p></reply>

This includes strong job creation by a number of IDA-supported firms. Since 2010 the number of staff at IDA-supported firms in Louth has almost trebled to over 3,900. Last year alone saw announcements from Almac, Wuxi and PCI which will result in the creation of over 700 jobs. The investment by Wuxi was particularly significant, with construction beginning earlier this year on the company's &euro;325 million state-of-the-art facility in Dundalk.</p></reply>

The following provisions of the 2007 Act are of particular relevance to the activities of online influencers:</p>  <p>  - section 55(x) of the Act which prohibits a trader from &lsquo;making a representation or  creating an impression that the trader</p>  <p>  (i) is not acting for purposes related to the trader&rsquo;s trade, business or profession, when the trader is so acting, or</p>  <p>  (ii) is acting as a consumer when the trader is not;</p>  <p>  - section 43(3)(e) and (h) of the Act which provide respectively that matters relating to the &lsquo;existence, extent or nature of any approval or sponsorship (direct or indirect) of the product by others&rsquo; and &lsquo;the trader&rsquo;s motives for the commercial practice&rsquo; may be the subject of false, misleading or deceptive information under sections 43(1) or (2) of the Act;</p>  <p>  - section 46(2) of the Act which provides that a commercial practice is misleading under the provisions of section 46 on the omission or concealment of material information if the trader fails to identify the commercial intent of a commercial practice and the practice would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision that he or she would not otherwise make. </p>  <p>  These provisions are relevant also to sponsored content.  In addition, section 55(q) of the Act provides that the following is a prohibited commercial practice:</p>  <p>  using editorial content in the media to promote a product (if a trader has paid for that promotion) if it is not made clear that the promotion is a paid promotion, whether in the content itself or in any oral, written, visual or descriptive representation in the promotion.</p>  <p>  In considering the application of the provisions of the 2007 Act to online influencers, it is relevant also to note that the definition of 'trader' at section 2(1) of the Act includes anyone acting on behalf of a trader.</p></reply>

As the major centre for paediatric education and training in the Irish health service, the hospital and satellite centres will bring together existing paediatric education programmes into one academic health sciences network.  </p>  <p>  The hospital will have associations with seven universities and will play a vital role in furthering professional education and this is reflected in the provision of dedicated education facilities. Education and training will include undergraduate and postgraduate campus training for medical, nursing and health and social care professional staff, continuous professional development of all clinical staff groups, acquisition and rehearsal of clinical skills, including simulated practice and delivery of educational programmes for students and visiting staff. There is also potential for international and cross-border education in, for example, certain disease areas where Ireland has particular expertise or high incidence, such as cystic fibrosis.</p>  <p>  The Final Project Brief for the new children&rsquo;s hospital includes the full cost of the third level education facilities as part of the Exchequer funding requirement. Education facilities will be located within the new children&rsquo;s hospital and will be built as part of the core hospital build. The hospital school will be located in a central area within the hospital building with direct horizontal and vertical links to the inpatient units. Higher education space will be integral to the main building and will include lecture theatres, seminar rooms and tutorial rooms.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issues raised by the Deputy such as timelines etc as this is a operational matter, I have asked the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

This includes 5 acute beds that opened in Letterkenny University Hospital in June 2019.</p><p>- 47 additional beds, including the 40-bed modular build in South Tipperary General Hospital (STGH), 3 HDU beds in the Mater Hospital and 4 HDU beds in Cork University Hospital.</p><p>- preparation of 202 beds, of which 16 are critical care, during 2019, with a view to bringing this extra capacity into operation in the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>- Commencement of works on a 60-bed modular ward in University Hospital Limerick</p><p>With regard to the specific questions the Deputy has asked, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly.  </p></reply>

Following the signing of contracts in July 2017, the remediation works commenced and, in December 2018, I visited the site to see that the works had been substantially completed.  Activity in 2019 to date has involved the resolution of minor finishing works and the completion of the access road to the site.  </p>  <p>  While the priority has been remediation of the East Tip, work on assessing a suitable solution for the former steelworks factory site has also been advanced in preparation for the next phase of the remediation project. Detailed site investigations have been undertaken and the preparation of an application for planning consent has also been advanced. The Government has decided that the Minister for Defence will be the ultimate owner of Haulbowline Island, in keeping with the main occupancy of the island being the headquarters for the Irish Naval Service.  Any remediation solution for these areas will need to be cognisant of their likely long term use.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has advised that it has engaged specialist engineers to examine the areas in question in order to explore the potential of these areas for naval operations in the future which will inform and direct remediation works in the first instance.  Information from site investigation studies and assessments to date has been made available to the Department of Defence to assist in this work.</p></reply>

Prepared consumer food exports increased by 30% from &euro;2 billion in 2012 to over &euro;2.6 billion in 2018. In 2018, the UK accounted for 68% of PCF food and drink exports. The sector is, therefore, significantly exposed to the impact of Brexit and is challenged by the fact that most PCF companies are small and investment in research and innovation within the sector has traditionally been low.</p>  <p>Recognising the need to assist PCF companies to respond and adapt to these challenges, I announced in Budget 2018, the allocation of &euro;5m for the development of a Prepared Consumer Foods Centre (PCFC) in Teagasc, Ashtown, under the National Development Plan for the purchase of capital equipment which companies could pilot, with the assistance of Teagasc Food Technologists, with a view to scaling up their production, innovating or reformulating products.  The PCF Centre was officially opened on 18th   October 2018, ahead of schedule. </p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;5 million in Budget 2019 to build on this investment by providing funding for incubation units, in addition to the purchase of equipment for nutritional measurement and quality and sensory analysis.</p>  <p>  The Centre has, to date, assisted 50 companies to innovate and diversify products and their market focus, in order to help mitigate the negative impact of Brexit and to grow the indigenous PCF sector. </p>  <p>  To date, &euro;6.5 million of equipment has been purchased in total, and it is expected that the remaining &euro;3.5 million, will be committed by the end of 2019. </p>  <p>  The further development of PCF centre will continue to be assessed in light of the demands of the sector and its performance.  Ultimately, the long-term vision is to develop a Centre of Excellence with world-class research and technological services, providing opportunities to develop greater value added, to integrate better into the agri-food value chain and to address the wider sustainability issues facing the sector.</p></reply>

The Government sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.</p><p>These requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. My Department had previously carried out an extensive analysis exercise to establish the potential volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This exercise has been used, where appropriate, to guide relevant planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required. </p><p>Regarding staffing requirements, at all stages, my Department has sought to use a combination of recruitment, redeployment and temporary flexible solutions, such as contracted veterinary services, where appropriate and as necessary. Given the level of uncertainty surrounding Brexit, my Department&rsquo;s approach has been to adopt, where possible, options that offer a degree of flexibility, such as internal short term redeployment and contracted services, whilst ensuring, in conjunction and cooperation with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service (PAS), that avenues for more permanent recruitment are available and can be drawn from as necessary. This approach is with a view to being able to address requirements in the near to medium term across various possible contingencies, from the negative end of the spectrum in terms of a no deal-Brexit to more benign contingencies of a Brexit based on a deal between the EU and the UK. </p><p>Focussing on immediate initial requirements, in the area of East-West import and export controls for UK product into Ireland, in the event of a no-deal Brexit on October 31st, my Department will have 240 staff resources available across a range of disciplines in both front line control and back up administrative spheres. This overall number will include recruits, redeployed staff and contracted Private Veterinary Practitioners (PVPs  <b>)</b></p><p>Overall, the key grades where the majority of deployment will occur are in veterinary and portal inspector roles on the animals and products of animal origin side, as well as agricultural and forestry inspectors and portal inspectors on the plant health and forestry side. In terms of recruitment, engagement with PAS is ongoing</p><p>It is important to note that staffing estimates are provided on the basis of a disorderly Brexit using the infrastructure that is expected to be available in Dublin and Rosslare ports in October. The development of additional infrastructure has the potential to have a knock-on effect on the numbers of staff required, and this contingency is being actively examined. Estimates may also need to be revised in light of any new political developments or on foot of any changes to the UK&rsquo;s requirements, particularly regarding export certification.</p><p>In the context of an initial uncertain period in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it will be necessary to carefully observe how operational arrangements with respect to staffing are bedding down. Furthermore, it will also be necessary to observe how a no-deal Brexit might evolve, given the ongoing potential staffing effects.</p><p>I remain confident that my Department is in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

These supports provides a major injection of funds to the farming community at an important time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, broadly speaking, weather conditions have been favourable this year for farming and, given the significant availability of fodder countrywide, there are no plans to introduce fodder support measures this year.  </p></reply>

I have also had ongoing contacts with farming organisations, representatives and individual farmers to try to seek a resolution to this dispute.</p><p>The parties to the Agreement reached on 15 September are:</p><p>- Meat Industry Ireland</p><p>- Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association</p><p>- Macra na Feirme</p><p>- Independent Farmers Organisation of Ireland</p><p>- Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association  </p><p>- Beef Plan Movement</p><p>- Irish Farmers Association</p><p>- Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association</p><p>The full text of the Agreement is available at:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The Agreement involves a number of interventions which will provide immediate benefit for beef producers, as well as a range of strategic measures which seek to address structural imbalances in the sector.</p><p>As part of the deal, beef producers will benefit from an immediate<b></b>increase in a range of bonuses, as follows:</p><p>- an increase of 66% in the current in-spec bonus for steers and heifers from 12c/kg  to 20c/kg;</p><p>- the introduction of a new bonus of 8c/kg for steers and heifers aged between 30 to 36 months,  which meet all non-age related existing in-spec criteria, and which up to now  have not received any bonus; </p><p>- the introduction of a new in-spec bonus of 12c/kg for steers and heifers under 30 months in the categories of grade O- and fat score 4+ , which currently do not qualify for any bonus.</p><p>- the in-spec 70 day residency requirement will be reduced to 60 days on the last farm.</p><p>These measures offer an immediate financial benefit for beef farmers. They both increase the level of bonus being paid and increase significantly the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus. The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus on top of the base price paid. </p><p>A Beef Market Task Force will be established to provide leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.  I will appoint an independent Chair for the Taskforce, which will include my Department, relevant State agencies and nominees from farm organisations and the meat industry.  The Taskforce will provide for a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in this Agreement, with timelines and stakeholder engagement.  Furthermore, the Beef Market Taskforce will offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and regulatory authorities.</p><p>My Department is proactively engaging with several potential beef Producer Organisations, which have the potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain. The first beef Producer Organisation was approved by my Department last week.</p><p>A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the Agreement. For example:</p><p>- an immediate scientific review of the Quality Payment Grid by Teagasc;</p><p>- an independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in relation to the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the Irish beef sector;</p><p>The agreed measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.  The entry into force of the Agreement is contingent on the cessation of all protests and blockades.  All parties to the Agreement took responsibility for ensuring that this would happen, by recommending the Agreement to those they represent.  I would appeal to all those still protesting to consider the agreement carefully and to give it a chance to take effect, in the interest of their fellow farmers and the future of the beef sector.</p></reply>

This can be done with relative ease via a pre planning meeting with the Planning Authority or appropriate certification from a professional Engineer.</p><p>In relation to projects SCF-17-0005 and SCF-17-0006, both the professional Engineers, acting for the project applicants, certified that planning permission was not required.</p><p>I, as Minister, my Department or IFI have no function in the Planning Process and cannot set aside potential planning issues for applicants who basically refuse to meet the request of ascertaining whether their proposed works may require permission from a Planning Authority.</p><p>I again offer the Deputy a full briefing with Inland Fisheries Ireland in relation to fishery development project matters.</p></reply>

The Public Lighting Upgrade Project involves most of Irelands Local Authorities and is being steered by an advisory group chaired by a representative from the County &amp;amp; City Management Association (CCMA). Since the project has moved into the implementation phase it has been led by the RMO (Roads Management Office) a shared service for the Local Authorities. I would point out that some local authorities are not participating in the national project but are progressing and resourcing the lighting upgrade individually. My Department is involved in helping to progress the project and is represented on the Advisory Committee. The project was also successful in the competitive process for funding support under the Government's Climate Action Fund first call for proposals and was allocated &euro;17.47million. The amount to be spent in each county will however be a matter for the RMO to determine in consultation with the relevant local authorities. Given that data on county spend is not held by my Department, I would advise the Deputy to direct questions on county spend to the RMO. </p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas. </p><p>Both questions referenced by the Deputy relate to one premises which is located in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. </p><p>I can confirm an email from the premises owner was received in my Department on 6thSeptember and an acknowledgement was issued. A full reply will be issued shortly.</p><p>That email comments on the premises' proximity to a commercial deployment of high speed broadband. This deployment is part of eir's commercial roll out of high speed broadband to 300,000 predominantly rural premises, in line with a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p><p>eir&rsquo;s rural investment in high speed broadband is an entirely commercial undertaking, and not part of the planned State Intervention network. Although the deployment is monitored under the terms of the Commitment Agreement, it is not funded by the State and it is not planned, designed or directed by my Department in any capacity. </p><p>Decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the roll out and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis. I have no statutory role or function in such commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services</p><p>The State intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. In May of this year I brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p><p>The Government Decision means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close. The finalisation of financial closure and legal requirements are progressing towards contract award. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p><p>The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p><p>A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p><p>The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p><p>Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-19a.581.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091900063#WRK01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227 and 228 together.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling &euro;575m per year. Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding Early Learning and Care and School Age childcare programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. Ensuring that this money is properly accounted for, and that as many children as possible benefit from it, is a core responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Pobal assists the Department in the administration of the funding and in ensuring that services are compliant with the clearly documented rules of the various early learning and care and school age childcare schemes.</p>  <p>   The Public Accounts Committee on June 13 paid significant attention to this matter and highlighted the importance of compliance with scheme rules. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs' approach to compliance, and supporting services, strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. The approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended through a strong compliance function.</p>  <p>  Part of Pobal&rsquo;s role in overseeing compliance with programme rules is to carry out unannounced visits to services to check their compliance with programme rules. Subsidies for the Early Learning and Care and School Age childcare programmes are paid based on child attendance, which is a vital governance component of the funding for which the Department is responsible. Where Pobal discover that the actual pattern of attendance of a child does not match registrations for that child on Pobal&rsquo;s Programme Implementation Platform (IT system) they will calculate the amount of funding that has been overclaimed. The service will be advised by Pobal to make the necessary corrections to PIP registrations to ensure that the total amount of funding received for the programme year is correct. </p>  <p>  There is an appropriate amount of flexibility applied to this corrections process and Pobal works with services on a case by case basis. Attendance rules and their application do not penalise parents who occasionally pick up or drop off children early. Pobal, when determining a pattern of attendance during a compliance visit, aim to apply the rules in a manner which maximises the amount payable to providers. However, the recovery of overclaimed funds is an integral part of ensuring that public money is properly accounted for.</p>  <p>  From September 2018 to June 2019 (the latest available figures) Pobal identified 277 CCS services and 712 CCSP services with overclaims. It should be noted that some services have both a CCS and CCSP contract.</p>  <p>  The total amount of overclaimed funding identified by Pobal for the same period was &euro;3.2 million in CCS and &euro;2.5 million in CCSP. It is important to note that these overclaim figures are calculated at the time of the compliance visit but cover the full period of children&rsquo;s registration. They calculate any discrepancies up to the compliance visit date plus the amount that would have been overclaimed if the incorrect registration had persisted to the end of the programme year. In addition, an assumption is made that the level of attendance at the time of the visit will continue for the rest of the cycle (or duration of the registration if less). Overclaim figures therefore estimate the total amount that would have been overclaimed across the year had the compliance visit not occurred. Whilst the above amounts of overclaim were identified, some services made the case that they had registered children under the wrong scheme and hence corrections were accepted by Pobal, lessening the amount of overclaim significantly. </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the subvention for CCS and CCSP is paid to a service based on the actual attendance of a child. As such, no child should have had their provision cut as a result of a compliance visit; rather the service makes corrections to ensure that they are claiming for the actual time that the child is in attendance. It is important to note that the compliance activity should result in the service provider only claiming from the Department for the hours the child is attending. Data available to the Department shows that the number of children accessing Government subsidies continues to increase and has doubled in recent years.  </p>  <p>  The Department oversees a Case Management process through which local City / County Childcare Committees and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care services in difficulty. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. Financial supports, which may also be accessed through the Case Management process, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues and following a financial assessment by Pobal. This includes a strand of funding targeted at community services requiring support to sustainably regularise their registrations.</p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the National Childcare Scheme. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. </p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, which was published last November.</p></reply>

The Department of Justice and Equality has policy responsibility for the new parent&rsquo;s leave and my Department is responsible for the associated parent's benefit. </p>  <p>  The new scheme will provide two weeks leave to both parents, including those who adopt a child, who are employees or self-employed and who take parent&rsquo;s leave from their employment to care for their child. This is in addition to existing maternity, paternity and adoptive leave entitlements. The scheme will support parents during the first year of the child's life, in line with the Programme for Government commitment. Child development outcomes are strongest when parents are facilitated to provide extended care for their children within the home during this first year. </p>  <p>  The cost of providing the benefit to both parents for 1 week is &euro;15.8m.

It is the responsibility of the relevant DPO to seek consent prior to taking up an offer of employment (or to provide services). Statistics on the number of applications for consent under section 22 of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 are included in the annual Regulation of Lobbying report published by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p><p>The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour sets out further guidance on the acceptance of outside appointments and of consultancy engagement following resignation or retirement (Section 20). Civil Servants who hold positions which are &ldquo;designated positions&rdquo; for the purposes of the Ethics Acts shall not, within twelve months of resigning or retiring from the service, accept an offer of appointment from an employer outside the Civil Service or accept an engagement in a particular consultancy project where the nature and terms of such appointment or engagement could lead to a conflict of interest, without first obtaining approval from the appropriate authority. Officers below Assistant Secretary level must apply to the Secretary General or Head of Office in which they are serving, or have last served before retirement or resignation.

The breakdown of these projects by local authority and year received, is set out in the following table.  All projects have been approved, apart from 6 received recently, which are shown below as '2019 Project Applications' and which are now being assessed.<table><tr><th>LA</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019<br /><br />Projects Approved</th><th>2019<br /><br />Project Applications</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td></tr></table></p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently leading a review on the Public Spending Code (PSC). This is the critical framework for the control and governance of all public expenditure activities and it, in turn, determines the approach for publicly-funded construction projects which is set out in the  Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), the objectives of which are to ensure cost certainty, value for money and financial accountability.</p><p>Social housing construction projects, whether implemented via the single stage or four stage process, must comply with the CWMF and the PSC, similar to publicly-funded construction projects in other sectors. When the PSC review is complete, my Department will be in a position to consider its implications, if any, for social housing projects. </p><p>In concentrating the 9 review stages of the CWMF to 4 for most social housing construction projects, as well as operating a single stage process for projects up to &euro;2 million, my Department has already streamlined the approval arrangements, while still ensuring appropriate oversight and control arrangements in relation to public funds.  </p><p>It is also the case that most of the time required to advance social housing construction projects to site arise from local authority activities such as design, planning, procurement and engagement with contractors. The time involved in approving projects is a small element only of the overall period for advancing the projects.</p></reply>

As such, Ireland has designated 439 sites as special areas of conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive and classified 154 sites as special protection areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive.  Under national legislation, SACs and SPAs are collectively termed &lsquo;European sites&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  To protect the habitats and species in the European sites for which they are designated, and to avoid accidental or deliberate damage in these sites, it is necessary to have in place a system by which potentially damaging activities require consent before they can be carried out. </p>  <p>  &lsquo;Activities Requiring Consent&rsquo; are specific activities which must not be carried out on a European site unless prior consent is given by me, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, or by another relevant public authority.  This safeguard ensures that the potential effects of the activity on the European site are assessed before works are carried out. Also that consent is granted only after having determined that the activity will not adversely affect the integrity of the European Site.</p>  <p>  The Salmon Conservation Fund is an initiative of Inland Fisheries Ireland, launched in 2007, in order to fund rehabilitation, protection and conservation projects, all of which must focus on salmon. The fund was expanded in 2019 to include sea trout.</p>  <p>  If a project under this fund (or indeed any other project) is to take place within a European Site and includes activities which are listed as Activities Requiring Consent for that European Site, then my prior consent, or that of another relevant authority, is required before the activity is carried out. </p>  <p>  In some cases, planning permission may be required for activities that are listed as &lsquo;exempted development&rsquo; under the Planning and Development Regulations.  This occurs in cases where I have received an application to carry out an activity requiring consent on a European Site but, following screening for appropriate assessment of the activity by officials of my Department, it is determined that the activity is likely to have a significant effect on a European Site and therefore requires a full appropriate assessment. In such cases the &lsquo;exempted development&rsquo; status of the activity is dis-applied and planning permission under the Planning and Development Acts is required.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific cases referred to by the Deputy, the staff of my Department considered an application for an Activity Requiring Consent for one of these cases, and following consideration of the potential implications for the Special Area of Conservation in which the project was located, my staff recommended that the local group involved should contact the County Council Planning Department in order to determine if Planning Permission was required.</p></reply>

The Hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat niche and its overall conservation status at that time was assessed as favourable.  </p><p>In addition to the reporting requirements of the EU Habitats Directive, data on the distribution of the hare is being collected continuously by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and the recent <i>Atlas of Mammals in Ireland 2010-2015 </i>provided a summary of the species&rsquo; range, demonstrating that it remains widespread across the country. </p><p>My Department commissioned a new assessment of the status of hare&rsquo;s population in Ireland which took place using camera traps, over the winter of 2018/2019, before RHD2 was known to occur in the wild in Ireland.  I hope that this report will be available for publication next month. </p><p>Given the outbreak of the RHD2 virus which was first confirmed in the wild in Ireland only last month and based on what we have been able to establish in that period,  RHD2 appears to be relatively widespread. The virus is known to be highly contagious and easily spread and environmental contamination presents significant difficulties in terms of any biosecurity responses.  I made the decision last month to suspend the licences issued to the Irish Coursing Club on behalf of its affiliated clubs to capture and tag hares for the 2019/20 hare coursing season which were due to come into effect on 10 August until a clearer understanding of the extent, spread and implications of the RHD2 virus emerges.  I am keeping this mater under continuous review.  I am reflecting too on the implication of this disease for the upcoming open season and I will make a decision in that regard shortly.</p></reply>

The population of Corncrakes in Ireland has been monitored annually since 1993 (by recording how many male birds are calling at night-time) and is critically low, with 151 calling males recorded in 2018. Donegal remains the national stronghold, with 90 confirmed calling males. West Connacht, which comprises the western seaboards of counties Mayo and Galway, held 59 males. Two calling males were recorded in  Co. Sligo.</p>  <p>  Restoration of the Corncrake population is an important component of my Department&rsquo;s overall work on species protection. Measures to protect the Corncrake include the designation of 9 Special Areas of Protection (SPAs) for the protection of breeding corncrake populations in Ireland. The offshore islands, particularly off Donegal, are of critical importance.  Conservation measures in 2018 included habitat management and the administration of grant schemes to promote beneficial land management for the species.</p>  <p>  The National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme for Corncrakes offers incentives to landowners to create and manage habitat for Corncrakes. Landowners nominate plots they would like to work on and receive payment for habitat creation and putting management measures in place for Corncrake. In 2018, there were 10 farmers in the NPWS Farm Plan Scheme delivering 63.52ha of habitat for Corncrake.</p>  <p>  The NPWS also operates the Corncrake Grant Scheme, where landowners who have Corncrake calling on or near their land receive a grant for adopting Corncrake friendly mowing practices. In 2018, 125 participants entered the Corncrake Grant Scheme (CGS), covering an area 352.78ha nationally.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine operates a Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environmental (GLAS) Corncrake Measure, which aims to create and maintain cover and nesting shelter for Corncrakes during breeding season (April to September).  Farmers undertaking the measure are required to commit to provision of early cover dominated by broad-leaved plant species e.g. Iris or nettle, and grazing, mowing, topping and/or other field operations requiring the use of machinery are not permitted from 10 March to 10 August annually.</p>  <p>  In 2018, there were 64 GLAS participants with 209ha of land planned for delivering Corncrake habitat.</p>  <p>  Following decades of decline, the breeding population of corncrakes has stabilised, albeit at low numbers. My Department will continue to work with farmers and landowners towards the conservation of this species in Ireland and I look forward to seeing improved population numbers as a result of these measures.</p></reply>

In recent decades, it has suffered from the continued decline of its habitats and the condition and extent of our bogs. Red Grouse require large areas of natural and semi-natural habitat; the destruction and fragmentation of these habitats have been identified as major threats to Red Grouse populations.  </p><p>The last comprehensive survey was carried out in 2006/2008, which found just under 2,000 breeding pairs of Red Grouse in Ireland. Since 1980, the population is considered to have declined by up to 40%. Additionally, there has been a decline of over 50% in their breeding range from 1972 to 2018.  </p><p>In 2012, the NPWS carried out survey of Red Grouse in the Owenduff/Nephin Complex Special Protection Area (SPA) in County Mayo, an SPA which had previous declines in grouse populations due to changes in habitat quality and extent, largely caused by overgrazing.  This survey showed the population had almost doubled since an earlier survey in 2002.  This increase in grouse numbers is attributed to beneficial management of the land  in the intervening period. Off-wintering of livestock from 2006 has allowed an improvement in the habitat condition within the Owenduff/Nephin SPA. </p><p>A Red Grouse Species Action Plan () was completed in 2013 by the National Red Grouse Steering Committee, supported by my Department.  This national plan sets out the background to the species decline, the challenges facing conservation efforts, the pressures the population is under and a framework for action to deliver conservation measures for Red Grouse in Ireland. </p><p>Since the plan was published, there have been a range of positive conservation measures undertaken to maintain and improve the existing habitat for Red Grouse and to support breeding pairs, through habitat management and other measures. These measures have been particularly successful where farmers, hunters and ecologists have cooperated together.</p><p>The national Species Action Plan lists a number of locally-led management projects such as the Ballydangan Bog Red Grouse Project, Co. Roscommon, which started in 2009 and which supports active management of grouse habitat which has also benefitted other threatened species including breeding Curlew.</p></reply>

It has a vision for a vibrant, creative and sustainable Irish film, television and animation industry, with diverse voices, talent and opportunities which speaks to and connects Irish film culture with audiences at home and abroad. </p>  <p>  Screen Ireland also works in conjunction with the enterprise agencies to support the development of the film sector to make a substantial contribution to inward investment. It promotes Ireland as a location for international production by providing advice and support for international companies seeking to locate production activity to Ireland, organising inward and outward trade missions on an annual basis and working in partnership with EU counterparts on co-productions. In April 2018, I joined with the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, in launching my Department&rsquo;s capital investment plan: 'Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 - 2027&rsquo;. This plan incorporated an amount of &euro;200m to be invested in media production and the audiovisual industry over the next 10 years and represented a first step in the Government&rsquo;s ambitions to enable Ireland to become a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation. The investment will be delivered through Screen Ireland whose budget for 2019 was increased to &euro;20 million. </p>  <p>  Government policy also supports the sector through Section 481 tax relief, international film co-production treaties, an annual international programme of Irish film festivals, and through engaging high-profile talent to project a positive image of Ireland and reflect Ireland as a creative place. Earlier this year, I was pleased to welcome EU Commission approval in respect of two aspects of Irelands tax credit: the extension of the Section 481 credit until 2024 provides certainty for film production companies on the future availability of the credit, ensuring the continued growth of our film industry. It is a key recommendation in the Audiovisual Action Plan, the industry-wide, long-term plan, under the Creative Ireland Programme. A further key measure under the Plan saw the introduction of the Regional Film Development Uplift which offers an additional tapered tax credit over a period of 4 years. This is an important step in support of this Government&rsquo;s ambition to make Ireland a global hub for the production of Film, TV Drama and Animation in supporting creative talent in Ireland and helping to develop a vibrant creative audio-visual sector throughout the country. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work to support the development and expansion of the film and television production sector. In that regard my Department will continue to work with Screen Ireland to ensure that Ireland is maximised as a location for both indigenous and international film production.</p></reply>

The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government allocated a further &euro;1m to the programme.  These monies enabled local authorities to support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives.  As well as this core support for local Creative Ireland programmes, each local authority is also provided with additional funding to support activities on Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g &ndash; the national day of creativity for children and young people which takes place in June.  This year each local authority was provided with &euro;15,000 (and in the case of each of the four Dublin local authorities, a sum of &euro;75,000 reflecting their larger populations) to activate Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g in their respective administrative areas. </p><p>Cumulatively, the above funding streams supported over 1,200 projects nationally in 2018 and it is expected they will fund a similar amount of projects this year - to date 780 Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g projects alone were funded this year. The types of projects supported include arts projects, grant schemes, concerts, conferences, exhibitions, festivals, outreach projects, publications, research programmes, and workshops among other activities. They cover topics such as dance, film, music, poetry, storytelling, theatre and the visual arts. Further information is available on  </p><p>Also under the Creative Ireland Programme, the Creative Youth Plan commits to specific actions to increase and enhance access to a range of creative and cultural activities and practices for young people, including drama and music. As part of this commitment, my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills has in 2019 increased funding to Music Generation aimed at a national roll-out of the programme, while only last month I announced the provision of funding to Youth Theatre Ireland to assist them in developing a bespoke training programme for youth theatre facilitators and the establishment of new theatre groups in 3 pilot areas.</p><p>Further details of the Strategic Plans, Reports and Research Papers and news relating to Creative Ireland including annual reports can be viewed on the Creative Ireland website www.creativeireland.gov.ie.  </p><p>In addition to the above, the following initiatives supported by my Department are targeted towards support for music.</p><p>- The National Folk Theatre, Siamsa T&iacute;re receives annual funding from my Department, brings to life Irish folklore through music, song and dance.</p><p>- My Department provides funding for the purchase of equipment under the Music Capital Scheme to performing groups and individual talented musicians on an annual basis throughout the country.  The Scheme is managed by Music Network  on behalf of my Department.</p><p>- Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;)is the largest group involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music both at community and national level.  Annual funding is provided by my  Department  to CC&Eacute;  for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture They promote traditional music dance  in the following ways:</p><p>- Thousands of children and young people develop their musical performance (instrumentation and vocal) skills and appreciation skills at these mentored weekly classes, where the emphasis is oral transmission in an appropriate context. Over 1,500 Classes are delivered weekly in community settings. </p><p>- With over 400 branches, 18 centres, 7 Regional centres and 11 Outreach centres throughout Ireland, Britain, North America and worldwide, a wide variety of formal and informal performance opportunities are provided through the Comhaltas structures and Centres. Each Centre has a local performance group which provides appropriate opportunities for young traditional artists (aged 16 upwards) to participate in formal stage performances.</p><p>- Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann which is run by CC&Eacute;, has record attendance of 500,000 annually with over 6,000 participating in its competitions.</p><p>The Department provides annual funding to the Cross-Border Orchestra Peace Proms in which 20,000 children from 250 schools across the island of Ireland participate. The Proms provide a vital platform for young people to showcase their musical talent.</p><p>My Department ran the Small Scale Local Festivals and Summer Schools fund earlier this year under the scheme, a total of &euro;111,000 was allocated to 50 events under this scheme in 2019, with a maximum funding of &euro;5,000 per grant available through a competitive application process. Full details of this scheme are available at . It is currently envisaged that this funding scheme will run again in 2020, subject to available funding. Eighteen projects are benefitting from funding under my Department's 2019</p><p>Cooperation with Northern Ireland Scheme Projects range from exhibitions, workshops and cultural events and involve bodies on both sides of the border cooperating in a cultural context.  Some examples of the projects being funded include the Smashing Times Theatre &amp;amp; Film Company which is producing an arts-based project using creative processes of theatre, film and new digital technologies to promote peace building and positive community relations between people and traditions in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland today.</p><p>Further details of allocations can be seen at . Details of other projects and events previously funded directly can be seen at  </p><p>The Arts Council which is funded by my Department also has a number of schemes and initiatives around the support of music and drama. Details of these can be accessed on its website at the following link: www.artscouncil.ie. Funding for the Arts Council has increased in recent years and now stands at &euro;75 million in 2019, an increase of &euro;6.8m or 10% over 2018. Much of this is invested by the Council through its Strategic Funding programme which includes grants to key arts organisations across the country. Additional funding is invested in projects and programmes, including Arts Grant Funding, Project Awards, Open Call, and grants for hundreds of productions, touring and festivals nationwide and details can be viewed on the Arts Council's website on its funding webpages. </p><p>The Festivals Investment Scheme operated by the Arts Council will open for applications on 15th October for events that will take place between July and December 2020.  These applications close on Thursday 14th November and details may be found at .</p><p>The National Concert Hall (NCH<b>)</b>has a wide and varied programme for Musicians and Music Students that offers a variety of initiatives to develop young musicians as well as lifelong learning through engagement with people of all ages and all sectors of society.Further details of these can be viewed in its website under its Learning and Participation webpage. </p><p>The State Ceremonial strand of the commemorative programme for the remainder of the Decade of Centenaries (2019 &ndash; 2023) will be augmented with a rich diversity of commemorative activities designed to encourage authentic historical enquiry about this period and broad public engagement.  Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with a range of State partners, including the National Cultural Institutions, (institutions of learning, local authorities, creative communities, trade unions and other stakeholders).  </p><p>The National Cultural Institutions will have a significant role in creating opportunities for people of all ages and traditions to explore and reflect upon this divisive period in our history. Our National Cultural Institutions have an important role as custodians of our history and culture.  By conserving, protecting and sharing their extensive collections of authentic archive material, layers of meaning are added to the historical events that took place.  One such example is the National Library's latest cultural digitisation project &ndash; Towards a Republic &ndash; which runs over the remainder of the Decade of Centenaries and will see the digitisation of some of the personal papers of the signatories of the Treaty in preparation for the centenary of the foundation of the State</p><p>More details of are available on my Department's website at .  It should be noted that events arranged by individual National Cultural Institutions and bodies under the aegis of my Department are a day-to-day matter for each specific body in which I do not have an operational role.</p></reply>

It strives to foster children and young people&rsquo;s creativity, potential and participation in the arts as an integral part of their education. The initiative recognises that the arts are a powerful means through which children and young people can explore communication and collaboration, stimulate their imaginations to be inventive, and harness their boundless curiosity.</p><p>Schools selected to participate in the programme do so on a two-year cycle - the first to support them in developing a feasible creative plan for the school, and the second to enable them to implement this plan.  Each participating school is provided with access to a Creative Associate, who are essential in embedding inspirational and sustainable creative practices in teaching and learning.  Creative Associates are a mixture of practising artists and teachers with an understanding of creativity and its potential to transform the lives of children and young people. In addition, each school is allocated an annual grant of &euro;2,000 to implement their plans.</p><p>There was significant interest in the pilot when launched in 2018 - with some 400 schools applying for 150 places.  Given this level of interest, and the positive feedback from participants, total investment in the initiative for 2019 has increased to &euro;2.36m - funded by my own Department as well as the Department of Education and Skills and the Arts Council.

The first two records came from rabbits &ndash; one in Wicklow, the other in Clare. The first report from an Irish hare came on the 9th August. Since these initial incidents a request for public involvement has led to further confirmation of the disease. To date the disease has been confirmed from six different counties &ndash; Cork, Clare, Leitrim, Offaly, Wicklow and Wexford. </p>  <p>  In all cases a post mortem of the dead animal was carried out by qualified personnel in the Regional Veterinary Laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine. Tissue samples have then been sent to that Department&rsquo;s specialist virology lab in Backweston where RHD has been confirmed. </p>  <p>  I am grateful to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine&rsquo;s laboratories for their professional and expert work on this issue to date. </p>  <p>  RHD2 is known to be density dependent. The virus is also known to be highly contagious and environmental contamination presents significant difficulties in terms of any biosecurity responses. </p>  <p>  Both Departments  are continuing to monitor wild rabbit and hare deaths and a fuller understanding of the extent and impact of this disease in Ireland will emerge. At this early stage, I have no plans to appoint an independent assessor to supplement the work being undertaken by both Departments.</p></reply>
