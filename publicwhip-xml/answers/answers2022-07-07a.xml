The original target of 8% and the revised target of 12% under the National Access Plan of new entrants to higher education with disabilities has now been exceeded. 12.2% of new entrants to higher education in 2019/20 declared a disability.</p><p>On the further education and training side, some 5.9% of enrolments in 2021, were reported as having at least one type of disability.  Enrolments were primarily concentrated among Adult Literacy, Community Education and PLC programmes.</p><p>While this all represents good progress, I want more to be done. </p><p>The new national Access Plan is currently being finalised and I expect will be published in the common months.</p><p>Students with disabilities will continue to be a priority group in the new plan with a particular focus on students with an intellectual disability.</p><p>The work to support learners with an intellectual disability will be supported with a new funding stream under the Programme for Access to Higher Education.  The PATH Strand 4 - &euro;12 fund over four years will be implemented in two phases.  </p><p>My Department will also continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review in keeping with the objective of enabling a greater number of students with disabilities to access opportunities in higher and further education in the future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-07a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070700064#WRB00400"><p>A core mission for my Department is to continue to advance efforts to ensure that Ireland offers learning opportunities to all who wish to pursue them on a lifelong basis, provides the right skills and competences to learners to succeed, and produces  further and higher education graduates, apprentices and trainees with the right skills to support our economy, society and essential public services.</p>  <p>  At an institutional and provider level this requires agility, responsiveness and continual engagement with employers to understand emerging and evolving skills needs.</p>  <p>  At a national level, the National Skills Council advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on how to secure delivery of these needs. Key high level trends identified at recent National Skills Council meetings include automation and digitisation, digital literacy and transversal skills. Information on these trends is then used to guide the implementation of key skills strategies and initiatives such as the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.</p>  <p>  Engagement with the national skills architecture has also informed the development of new undergraduate places for the coming academic year.  On 28th June, I announced the creation of close to 1,000 targeted places across areas of key skills needs. These places will be permanent additions in the system, and will be in areas including Healthcare, ICT, Architecture and Construction, Engineering and Environment.</p>  <p>  Apprenticeships are playing an increasing role in meeting our skills needs as a country.  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.  In 2021, a record 8,607 new apprentices were registered- an almost 40% increase on the figures from 2019, the last broadly comparable pre-pandemic year. Development of new apprenticeship programmes has continued despite the pandemic challenges with 65 apprenticeship programmes currently on offer.</p>  <p>  The further education and training sector also plays a critical role in meeting critical skills needs.  We are also working to strengthen the further education and training system under a new strategy for that sector.  This will help ensure that our tertiary education system as a whole equips our students with the knowledge, skills and expertise required to secure good quality, well paid and sustainable employment.  This includes building on traditional areas of strength such as healthcare and construction and building capabilities aligned with emerging skills needs, in areas related to sustainable development.  </p></reply>

There is a particular responsibility on those charged with educating the next generation in ensuring that their learners are equipped to lead the change more widely across society.</p>  <p>  I fully support the core principle underpinning the strategy that we must take a zero tolerance approach.  Everyone is entitled to a safe environment to study and work free from violence and harassment, and that informs the policy approaches and interventions that have been adopted across the sector. </p>  <p>  Tackling sexual violence and harassment has been and will continue to a particular policy priority for me and my Department. In fact, one of the very first actions I took after my appointment as Minister in 2020 was to write to all publicly funded higher education institutions outlining my commitment to tackling sexual violence and harassment in higher education and requesting that institutions take a number of actions in this area, including the development of institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. All publicly-funded institutions now have such action plans in place. </p>  <p>  The Framework for Consent in Higher Education, which was launched in 2019, has had funding of over &euro;400,000 allocated to a number of initiatives since its launch by my Department.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Higher Education Authority has allocated funding of over &euro;500,000 towards consent workshops, the development of the anonymous report and support tool, and the UCC Bystander intervention programme.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that these initiatives and any further actions required successfully deliver on the objective of securing zero tolerance of sexual harassment and gender based violence across the entire tertiary education sector.</p></reply>

SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the 16 Education and Training Boards have progressed a series of actions nationwide to support the goal of Fostering Inclusion. Such actions include the development and roll-out of a series of good practice guidelines and promoting the concept of inclusion across the Further Education and Training (FET) Sector. </p>  <p>  In this context, I was delighted to launch the &lsquo;Universal Design for Learning for FET Practitioners: guidelines last year.  SOLAS is also continuing to develop the knowledge and resources that promote and drive consistent learner support, based on UDL principles in partnership with key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Last year I allocated &euro;5.4 million on strategic projects to help students with disabilities in higher education institutions, which included a range of universal design initiatives.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced further funding for a range of new initiatives to support autistic students and those with an intellectual disability access third level education. The proposals, which will form part of the proposed new National Access Plan, will allocate ring-fenced funding of &euro;3 million a year to 2025 so higher education institutions can implement universal design and inclusive practices on their campuses, and enhance opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities in higher education.</p>  <p>  Funding in 2022 will be specifically directed towards universal design and inclusive practices. This includes improving campus accessibility improvements such as supporting autism friendly campuses such as wayfinding apps, signage, small-scale capital works such as autism-friendly spaces such as sensory rooms or quiet zones.</p></reply>

This is allocated by the HEA to HEIs through the recurrent grant. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;3m to underpin student well-being and mental health in higher education institutions was secured for each of the 2020/21 and 2021/22 academic years as part of the funding packages, to mitigate against the impact of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The HEA have advised my Department that although specific information on waiting times for appointments is not available, the additional funding over the past two years has resulted in all higher education institutions reporting a reduction in waiting times, with some institutions being in a position to offer rapid access resources. </p>  <p>  This funding has also enabled support services in institutions to use new platforms and communication channels to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to contact their student mental health services.</p>  <p>  In the Further Education and Training area, learners may have access to internal psychological supports from qualified Education and Training Board personnel.  Funding for these supports are dispersed under general individual programme and learner support headings. SOLAS also allocates funding for Guidance, Counselling and Psychological Services for Youthreach participants.</p>  <p>  My Department, working with the HEA and SOLAS and the tertiary education institutions themselves will continue to work to ensure that there is appropriate access to mental health services for students and learners, including through the Estimates for 2023. </p></reply>

These measures include a new temporary tuition scheme, an extension of eligibility to Springboard, a new bursary scheme for those who wish to take SOLAS approved PLC courses and an extension of the Student Assistance Fund. </p>  <p>  The European Commission have also indicated to Member States to be flexible in their use of the national Erasmus grant to support displaced persons wishing to continue their full-time education, and my officials are now working with the HEA to put this in place.  Finally, existing supports for mental health and well-being provision in the HEIs will be extended to include displaced students.</p>  <p>  I am confident the series of supports outlined will address the needs of those displaced students and researchers and my officials and I will continue to closely monitor their implementation and the level of demand being sought, with the help of the NSR Helpdesk to ensure we meet the needs of these displaced students.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-07a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070700064#WRB01900"><p>I am acutely conscious of the serious concerns as strong inflationary pressures impact on the cost of living for all in our society and communities, including those working in the higher and further education and training sector.   </p>  <p>  The Government's Summer Economic Statement published earlier this week sets out the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy which will seek to protect public services, allow us to introduce further measures to address the cost of living pressures in the autumn, and at same time maintain fiscally sustainable expenditure into the medium term.</p>  <p>  As far as pay levels are concerned, as the Deputy will be aware, WRC-facilitated talks with the public sector trade union movement to undertake a review under &ldquo;Building Momentum&rdquo; were recently adjourned and all sides are reflecting on their positions to seek to reach a mutually acceptable position.  I know that the official side will continue to engage positively, as they seek to address the concerns which have triggered the review process.</p>  <p>  I have engaged as Minister with staff representatives in higher education on issues of concern such as, for example, low pay and short-term contracts.  Clearly, a key issue is establishing the scale and scope of these issues.  In this regard, a recent HEA report indicated that 11% of headcount are hourly-paid in the technological sector, with 17% falling into this category in traditional universities. It is accepted that data collection of this category is challenging.  Institutional report of staff data under the Employee Control Framework will be one element which we will address with the sector in the context  of our wider reform discussions.  </p>  <p>  Funding the Future sets out the Government's objectives for funding higher education on a sustainable basis and my commitment to an ambitious programme of reform to be delivered alongside increased investment.  A key priority of this reform process is enhancing the quality and international standing of the higher education system across its three core missions of teaching, learning and research through investment in the higher education workforce. </p>  <p>  I am committed to working with our agencies, the sector and key stakeholders including staff representatives to ensuring that the adoption of a sustainable future model of funding will enable - amongst other objectives - steps to be taken to address the issue of precarious work in the sector.</p></reply>

This has been done in collaboration with the Irish Universities Association and Technological Higher Education Association and the National Advisory Forum for Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Doctoral Education.</p>  <p>  In February 2022, I wrote to the Presidents of Higher Education Institutions requesting that they undertake a sectoral exercise to agree a set of high-level principles to which all institutions can work towards. I asked that they undertake a feasibility study to determine the next steps in progressing towards greater consistency and transparency in arrangements for postgraduate researchers. This work is progressing and it is envisaged that this exercise will be completed in Autumn 2022.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Government is committed to meeting the ambition set out in Impact 2030, Ireland&rsquo;s national research and innovation strategy, that researchers and innovators working in Ireland should have the best possible experience and to make the biggest possible difference.</p>  <p>  On 1 July, the Taoiseach and I announced a new partnership between industry and the Government to recruit and retain research talent. </p>  <p>  Innovate for Ireland is an important collaboration between industry and the Government and will make a significant contribution to the aims of our research and innovation strategy.</p>  <p>  The initial phase of the Innovate for Ireland initiative will seek to attract up to 400 PhD high calibre students to undertake research in Ireland that tackles national and global grand challenges such as climate change and climate adaptation; global health and pandemics; water poverty; digital society; and cyber-security. </p>  <p>  An attractive package, including a stipend of &euro;28,000, will be awarded through the programme to the PhD students. This has been benchmarked against similar scholarship programmes internationally. The programme will embrace all relevant disciplines from Science, Technology and Engineering to Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.</p></reply>

Early intervention and early educational experiences are crucial in this regard. </p>  <p>  My Department, therefore, works collaboratively with the Department of Education applying those principles to support successful transitions to further and higher education, including from DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  Work on the development of the new National Access Plan (NAP) for the period 2022 - 2028 is almost complete. It is my intention to bring a Memorandum to Government on the new NAP shortly and publish the strategy early in the next quarter.  </p>  <p>  Priority groups under the new NAP will continue to include students from socio-economically disadvantaged groups that have low participation in higher education. The indicators that help to inform progress on NAP implementation and the delivery of increased equity of access include entry to higher education from students who have attended DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  There has been demonstrable success in supporting transitions from DEIS schools to higher education.  At the commencement of the last National Access Plan in 2015, 3,959 students entered higher education. By the 2020/21 academic year, this had increased to 5,320 new entrants from DEIS schools.  </p>  <p>  This finding is in line with a Department of Education report from 2021 which noted an increase in the transition rates of those attending DEIS schools to higher education in 2020.  </p>  <p>  These transitions have been supported in a variety of ways including the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) programme, the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) and the Education and Training Boards Ireland work on supporting DEIS learner&rsquo;s transition to FET.</p>  <p>  We will continue to measure entry to higher education for those attending DEIS schools over the lifetime of the new Plan to ensure we maintain a high level of ambition for all of our learners.</p></reply>

This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190m paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students.  </p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.  In advance of the Budget, my Department will be publishing, for the first time, a costs of education paper which will set out the possible policy options, and their indicative costs, to aid public discussion on how we should prioritise any interventions to address costs of education. </p>  <p>  I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the student contribution is too high, and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families.  </p>  <p>  I also recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education. </p>  <p>  My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole.</p></reply>

Prior to the establishment of this resource, Ukrainian students were contacting individual higher education institutions (HEIs) creating challenges in obtaining an accurate picture of the demand for places and mitigating against ensuring a consistent approach by each HEI to issues arising.</p>  <p>  The National Student and Researcher (NSR) Helpdesk is central to determining the demand, as well as ensuring consistency in terms of the response.  It is currently gathering data on enquiries made to all HEIs in Ireland, as well as those made directly the Helpdesk itself and will start working with students on their admissions applications in the coming weeks.  This will allow my Department to get a better picture of the level of demand for places.</p>  <p>  On 21 June, I secured agreement from Government to introduce a series of measures to help these displaced students and researchers. These measures include a new temporary tuition scheme, an extension of eligibility to Springboard, a new bursary fund for those who wish to take SOLAS approved PLC courses and an extension of the Student Assistance Fund. The European Commission have indicated to Member States to be flexible in the use the national Erasmus grant, which can be used to support those displaced persons wishing to continue their full-time education here, and officials of my Department are now working with the HEA, in its role as the National Agency for Erasmus for higher education, to put these supports in place.  Finally, existing supports for mental health and well-being provision in the HEIs will be extended to include displaced students.</p>  <p>  A Working Group on English Language for Academic Purposes (EAP) was set up under the auspices of the National Steering Group, and proposals to ensure displaced students entering into the Irish higher education sector have the requisite English language skills are being finalised.  I expect to have their conclusions by the end of this week. </p>  <p>  My officials and I have been working proactively with the sector to facilitate the continued education of these displaced students and researchers. I want acknowledge the contribution all those in the further and higher education sectors who have responded generously in assisting my Department to identify and respond to the needs of displaced students and staff.</p></reply>

It is my intention to progress measures to reduce the cost of education for students and families through changes to the Student Grant Scheme over time. </p>  <p>  This will build on improvements I have already made to the student grant scheme over the past two Budgets including improvements to postgraduate supports in Budget 2021 and a range of changes for the coming academic year.  From this coming September, there will be an increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant.

There is a broad range of courses in STEM related areas. </p>  <p>  HCI Pillar 3 will deliver 24 projects in higher education institutions, 20 of which involve collaborations between institutions. These projects also have a strong focus on STEM.</p>  <p>  The TU Dublin led Convene project has introduced two new initiatives to support and develop enterprise leaders: an Executive Ph.D. for Enterprise-Based Leaders and an MBA in Life Sciences Leadership (starting Sept 2022). Convene and the TU Dublin Graduate School of Business and School of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences have collaborated with the 30% Club. This will offer two scholarships for successful women applicants to boost gender representation in the Life Sciences sector.</p>  <p>  It is also vital that we ensure that apprenticeships are seen as an option by people across society.  Only a very small proportion of apprentices are women, and it is vital that we support greater diversity.  That is why I announced a new gender-based bursary for apprenticeship employers. The bursary, which is worth &euro;2,666, is available to employers who employ apprentices on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender.</p>  <p>  These initiatives will be supported through wider moves to drive gender equality in the higher education system, including through the National Gender Equality Dashboard for Higher Education Institutions; the Athena Swan Charter and the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative (SALI) which is increasing the number of women involved in decision making roles in higher education.</p></reply>

Students can now earn up to &euro;6,552 during non-term time in 2022 without being concerned that it will affect their eligibility for a student grant in the academic year 2023/2024.  The main support available to students is the Student Grant Scheme administered by SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland). The scheme provides maintenance and fee grant support for eligible students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  Reckonable income under the Student Grant Scheme is household income from all sources including income from a student&rsquo;s employment. However, income from a student&rsquo;s employment which represents holiday earnings outside of term time but within the reference period can be deducted from the total reckonable income assessed.  When assessing reckonable income under the Student Grant Scheme it is the previous year&rsquo;s income that is assessed. Therefore applications to the awarding authority (SUSI) for the academic year 2023/2024 are assessed based on household income earned in 2022 (1st January to 31st December 2022) so a change of this nature would be reflected in the Student Grant Scheme for 2023/2024 as it is only at that stage that SUSI would consider income that was earned in non-term time during 2022.  </p></reply>

This includes over 700 final year apprentices who were fast-tracked to complete their qualification.</p>  <p>  The very welcome sustained growth in apprenticeship registrations has compounded Covid-related pressures on access by craft apprentices to off-the-job training. </p>  <p>  Implementation of a major response plan to address the waitlists is well advanced. This includes:</p>  <p>  - Capital funding of &euro;20m was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade facilities. </p>  <p>  - Further funding of &euro;17m has been provided to SOLAS and the HEA to address backlogs, &euro;6 million of which is being invested in additional instructors, with over 100 additional posts approved.</p>  <p>  - Reform measures were also implemented to help clear the lists, including changed delivery structures for off-the-job training.</p>  <p>  Based on the end of May monthly figures (the most up to date figures available) there are 8,481 apprentices waiting to access off the job training.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the remainder of the Covid-19 backlog is cleared and the system has the capacity to meet the training needs of rapidly increasing numbers of apprentices, expansion of the apprenticeship system is continuing in 2022. In particular, further major investment in workshops and staff is planned for this year.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are in continuous engagement with SOLAS, the HEA and other partners on the matter of the backlog and it is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training for phases 4 and 6 will be cleared later this year.  The majority of phase 2 waiting lists is expected to be on target to be cleared by the end of 2022.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the recent increases in the cost of living, apprentices are primarily employees and all of the 65 apprenticeships are subject to a contract of employment. For the majority of apprenticeships, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. On that basis any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in the determination of apprenticeship pay or training rates. However, it is important to note that as employees, eligible apprentices are also entitled to access general employment supports through the social welfare system. This option is open to any employee, apprentice or not, who finds themselves in difficulty. There are allowances paid to apprentices and we are examining these in the context of the upcoming Estimates process.</p></reply>

These options include various Adult and Community Education Programmes; PLC courses, Skills to Compete and Skills to Advance courses, Youthreach, as well as Apprenticeships and Traineeships. Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre also provides a range of specialised programmes.</p>  <p>  The Letterkenny Campus of Atlantic Technological University has since 2019, collaborated with Monaghan Institute to offer a level 7 Degree in Health and Social Care on an outreach basis.  My objective of encouraging the development of a more integrated tertiary education system is intended to increase opportunities for this and for other types of collaboration between higher and further education in the future.  </p>  <p>  The FET provision in County Monaghan, as across the country, is being supported and expanded by the investment under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, the Adult Literacy for Life Strategy and Future FET: Transforming Learning, the FET strategy 2020-2024.</p>  <p>  CMETB is leading one of 10 projects, which is funded nationally by SOLAS under the Skills to Advance Innovation for Collaboration Fund.  This project, Upskilling of the Food Sector for the Future through action learning, focusses on identifying key skills for the future for the Food Sector and applying modern technology to design and deliver an approach, which will deliver agreed skills in a timely manner.  It is envisaged that once this model is validated, it will provide a national framework for supporting SMEs and LEOs in the future.</p>  <p>  It is also important to set-out these plans in the context of the border regions.  The demand for skills does not stop at the border and for this reason, I fully endorse the development of cross-border projects in conjunction with the Regional Colleges in Northern Ireland.  This measure will not just address skills provisions, but also ensure compatible education and training provisions in all regions.  I believe that the new PEACE PLUS programme will provide further opportunity for these collaborations to flourish.</p>  <p>  Finally CMETB has identified a project associated with Monaghan Institute for possible funding under the FET College of the Future Major Projects Fund, a new capital investment programme for the FET sector.  This capital investment programme will support additional capacity, upgrading and enhancement of infrastructure in the FET sector, in line with the FET College of the Future principles as set out in the Future FET Strategy.

This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190m paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students.  </p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.  In advance of the Budget, my Department will be publishing, for the first time, a costs of education paper which will set out the possible policy options, and their indicative costs, to aid public discussion on how we should prioritise any interventions to address costs of education. </p>  <p>  I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the student contribution is too high, and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families.  </p>  <p>  I also recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education. </p>  <p>  My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole.</p></reply>

The Plan seeks to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum, across a wide range of programmes, by 2025.</p><p>The expansion of apprenticeship across all sectors has widened the impact of apprenticeship in areas of skills shortage such as engineering, retrofitting, technology and fintech. Under the Plan there will be increased online visibility regarding apprenticeship engagement and development processes for employers/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeships. Applications for new apprenticeship development are open on an ongoing basis, allowing employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis in all sectors of the economy.</p><p>Development of new apprenticeship programmes has continued despite pandemic challenges. There are currently 65 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 40 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021: arboriculture, equipment systems engineer, healthcare assistant, principal engineer &ndash; professional doctorate, recruitment executive, sales, scaffolding and supply chain associate.</p><p>So far this year, bar manager, wind turbine maintenance technician and transport operations &amp;amp; commercial driving apprenticeships have been launched. Programme development has been approved for programmes in areas such as farming, horticulture, finance, manufacturing, construction, cybersecurity and ICT, with several other programmes at the initial proposal stage.

This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p><p>- The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion.</p><p>Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p><p>- The National Apprenticeship Office is linking potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p><p>- A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship</p><p>- Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, included in the Higher Education Authority Bill, 2022, will widen the scope for new apprenticeship programmes in an expanded range of sectors.</p><p>The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p></reply>

This is demonstrated by the broad range of initiatives that have been introduced, or are being planned, to support the achievement of this objective over the past two years.</p><p>Over 43,600 students have already been approved for support through the Student Grant Scheme for 22/23. The recent review of the Scheme makes a number of recommendations on issues including the rates of grant, income thresholds, eligibility criteria and postgraduate support. It is my intention to progress measures to reduce the cost of education for students and families through changes to the Student Grant Scheme over time.</p><p>In this year&rsquo;s Budget I have made the first changes to SUSI undergraduate grant rates and eligibility thresholds in a decade, as well as changing the non-adjacency rules to benefit students who are commuting. Also students can now earn up to &euro;6,552 during non-term time in 2022 without being concerned that it will affect their eligibility for a student grant in 2023.</p><p>On 4<sup>th</sup>May I launched the Funding the Future framework which sets out my intention to implement a progressive range of measures to address costs as a barrier to education, in the context of overall Budgetary decision-making. </p><p>In this context, I want to see the student contribution in higher education reduced in a meaningful way over the course of future Budgets.</p><p>On accommodation affordability, restrictions have also been put in place to limit the amount that students can be required to pay up front for their accommodation.</p><p>I will be attending the Cabinet Committee on Housing next week to discuss student accommodation policy.  This will provide the opportunity to consider with my Government colleagues options for delivery of more student accommodation at affordable rental levels for students.</p><p>The distribution of laptops to disadvantaged students helps tackle the digital divide.  It is expected that 20,000 students will receive a laptop under the initiative.  The Devolved Capital Grant provides flexible capital funding to eligible higher education institutions to support small-scale building works and equipment purchase or renewal, including ICT.</p><p>The Department of Transport have introduced a new &quot;Youth Travel Card&quot; which will offer 50% discount on fares across the public transport network for those aged 19 to 23. </p><p>Finally, as set out in the Summer Economic Statement the Government is committed to further significant actions in Budget 2023 to address the serious cost of living issues currently confronting all in our community.</p></reply>

Collectively, these measures provided funding for 50,000 education and training places.</p>  <p>  Within the further education and training sector, the Skills to Compete initiative delivered through ETBs, working in tandem with INTREO offices, Regional Skills Fora, and Enterprise Ireland, supports those who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, to re-enter the workforce. The funding provided for 21,000 places on skills to Compete courses.  An additional 8,550 places were funded through Skillnet Ireland supported programmes, including via Skills Connect, which was launched to enable people reskill quickly, secure new roles within their sector, or undertake innovative conversion courses to access job opportunities in new sectors.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme was introduced  to support the continued recruitment and retention of apprentices across apprenticeship programmes during the COVID-19 period.  With provision for 10,000 places, the scheme ended for new applications on 31st December 2021.   Specific provision was also made available for 1,500 places under retrofit training and 1,600 places on the Skills to Advance initiative, led by SOLAS, which aims to equip employees with the skills to progress in their current job, or to take advantage of new job opportunities.</p>  <p>  In the higher education sector, the funding supported over 8,000 additional places on Springboard+ and HCI Pillar 1, modular programmes and post-graduate places under the Postgraduate Skills Provision programme.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to invest in the 2022 Budget across these measures to strengthen the financial position of universities and provide capacity for extra students and support and develop apprenticeships by funding a new employer apprenticeship grant and establishment of a new Apprenticeship Office.   We are also investing to upskill people in the key skills areas of the economy, such as for climate and low carbon initiative and we continue to support the upskilling of employees via Skillnet Ireland and Skills to Advance.</p></reply>

This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190m paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students.  </p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.  In advance of the Budget, my Department will be publishing, for the first time, a costs of education paper which will set out the possible policy options, and their indicative costs, to aid public discussion on how we should prioritise any interventions to address costs of education. </p>  <p>  I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the student contribution is too high, and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families.  </p>  <p>  I also recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education. </p>  <p>  My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole. </p>  <p>  In addition it is important to highlight the expanding pathways to post leaving cert education which are accessible to all learners as they prepare for their chosen career.  In addressing this, as part of budget 2022, we have removed the Post Leaving Certificate participant contribution fee of &euro;200. This will come into effect in September 2022.  </p>  <p>  We are working hard to introduce new apprenticeship programmes, such as the ones in bar managing and wind turbine maintenance which we launched in March, and we have also improved the financial incentives on offer to employers to take on apprentices, particularly female ones.</p>  <p>  We are also working hard to improve pathways from further to higher education as part of our Unified Tertiary System strategy. There should be no barriers for students who want to pursue their chosen educational and career goals.</p>  <p>  For the academic year 2022/23, we will also see significant enhancements to the financial supports that students who need them most receive through the Student Grant Scheme; where:</p>  <p>  - There will be an increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant;</p>  <p>  - The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant will be increased by &euro;1,000;</p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant will be reduced from 45km to 30km.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding by way of the Students Assistance Fund to students in eligible Higher Education Institutions who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  The total allocation for the Fund in the 2021/22 academic year, including additional Covid supports, is &euro; 18.5 million.</p></reply>

The Plan promotes general access, diversity and inclusion in apprenticeship through targeted actions to encourage participation from under-represented groups including people with disabilities, women and those from ethnic minorities.</p>  <p>  Targets and interventions for specific groups will be detailed through an Equity of Access subcommittee of the National Apprenticeship Alliance to ensure that the voice of under-represented groups is integral to the further development of the apprenticeship system. It is envisaged that the subcommittee will include representation from second-level, community education, youth justice programmes, broader FET provision, and higher education.</p>  <p>  The National Apprenticeship Office will increase the visibility of underrepresented groups in apprenticeship literature and promotional material to reflect the participation and positive experience of people from all backgrounds and communities, as well as the availability of assistive supports.</p>  <p>  The actions set out in the Plan build on the outcomes of the 2018 Review of Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship. This has already resulted in a significant widening of measures to support increased visibility of apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  Specific immediate actions in the Action Plan include: </p>  <p>  - Extension of the female bursary of &euro;2,666, which was paid to employers of female apprentices on the 25 craft apprenticeships, to encourage them to employ minority-gender apprentices to all apprenticeship programmes with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. </p>  <p>  - All apprentice jobs are advertised on www.apprenticejobs.ie, with information on apprenticeship now accessible from the CAO website. A dedicated apprentice guidance line has been established to support this initial period of increased visibility of apprenticeship to school leavers</p>  <p>  Other actions which will be delivered, including through the Equity of Access subcommittee include:</p>  <p>  - Access to apprenticeship programmes and pre-apprenticeship courses will be clearly labelled, with progression routes into apprenticeship clearly identified and information on these courses will be published on www.apprenticeship.ie.</p>  <p>  - An employer survey will determine baseline attitudes and knowledge of supports available to employers for supporting employees with a disability. </p>  <p>  - Participation targets for under-represented groups, and additional specific actions to support those target groups, will be set with the Equity of Access Subcommittee and monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that interventions supporting increased diversity within the apprentice population.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these measures and the implementation process for the Action Plan for Apprenticeship overall will have a significant impact in ensuring greater diversity in the apprenticeship population as a whole.</p></reply>

The Plan seeks to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum, across a wide range of programmes, by 2025.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan is based on feedback from enterprise, the education and training sector and apprentices themselves, among others, and we have listened to the issues and concerns raised.</p>  <p>  Nobody understands the skills employers need better than the employers themselves and without their engagement there can simply be no apprenticeships or places on those programmes. That is why we are driving supports, both financial and non-financial, to encourage and support their engagement. </p>  <p>  Significant financial supports have been introduced this year under the Action Plan:</p>  <p>  - The annual Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the grant. This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p>  <p>  - The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion.</p>  <p>  Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p>  <p>  - The National Apprenticeship Office will link potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p>  <p>  - Sector-specific supports to be delivered through apprenticeship consortia to support SME employers.</p>  <p>  - A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship.</p>  <p>  - Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, included in the Higher Education Authority Bill, 2022, will widen the scope for new apprenticeship programmes in an expanded range of sectors.</p>  <p>  The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p></reply>

As part of the last Budget, I prioritised a number of changes to the SUSI scheme which will benefit learners in the coming academic year.</p>  <p>  All student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, will increase by &euro;200 per year. </p>  <p>  The qualifying income thresholds, except the special rate which is broadly aligned with social protection payments have increased by &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  I have also introduced changes to the criteria for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant which means that from September 2022, the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant is reduced from 45km to 30km. In this way the scheme is responsive to eligible students who reside further away from college by providing an increased rate of student maintenance grant. </p>  <p>  These changes will benefit thousands of students and will build on the improvements that have already been made in the current academic year&rsquo;s student grant scheme.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding by way of the Students Assistance Fund to students in eligible Higher Education Institutions who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  The total allocation for the Fund in the current academic year, including additional Covid supports, is &euro;18.5 million.</p>  <p>  To inform the future direction of student supports, I commissioned the review of the Student Grant Scheme, which was published on 4th May. This provides a strong evidence basis for policy interventions to support students and their families.  The research confirmed that the rate of grants for undergraduate student supports provided under the Student Grant Scheme has been relatively unchanged over the previous number of years due to budgetary constraints while over the same period the cost of living for students has increased by 25%. </p>  <p>  My Department will be taking forward implementation of the Student Grant Scheme review. This will include the publication of a costs of education paper prior to the forthcoming Estimates. This will set out options for changes to the Student Grant Scheme and other measures to facilitate public discussion, including in the House, on what measures should be prioritised to support learners and their families.</p></reply>

Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole. This process is critical to enabling a number of key reforms, protecting quality and ensuring a fit for purpose sector which is enabled to evolve and adapt to future challenges. </p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that implementing the funding and reform framework will improve quality of outcomes from tertiary education, will strengthen the agility and responsiveness of higher education and will enhance the reputation of Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system internationally, including in international rankings. </p><p>The reforms and strategic outcomes identified by Government as a priority are as follows;</p><p>- Create unified knowledge and skills system which is balanced and integrated </p><p>- Strengthen representation in higher education for underrepresented groups </p><p>- Enhance quality by reducing the ratio of students to academic staff to comparable EU and OECD norms </p><p>- Reinforce alignment of sector with skills needs of the country &ndash; including those needed to deliver essential public services and meet national goals </p><p>- Drive forward a culture of lifelong learning.</p><p>I have established the HE Reform Implementation Group to bring about the benefits of &lsquo;Funding the Future&rsquo;. The work of this group and it working groups is intensively under way and all groups have met twice and are progressing their agendas. </p><p>As we move into the budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society; and working with aegis bodies will assess requirements and funding availability for 2023. </p></reply>

Our imperative is to ensure agility and responsiveness in the skills ecosystem. Through 2022 Ireland, in partnership with the OECD, is reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s skills strategies, policies and approaches to help us ensure that our skills system is future proofed. A core objective for my Department is to ensure that individuals and businesses are offered supports and pathways to quality education, upskilling and reskilling opportunities.</p><p>The National Training Fund supports initiatives including:</p><p><b>- </b>Skills to Advance is an employee development policy framework which enables targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce; </p><p>- Skills to Compete are a range of programmes to respond to the need for activation, upskilling and reskilling;</p><p>- Springboard+ provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need;</p><p>- Human Capital Initiative (HCI) range of programmes which seek to ensure that the higher education system as a whole responds to the constantly evolving skills needs of the economy;</p><p>- Skillnet Ireland provides subsidised training to business through learning networks operating nationwide and across all sectors.</p><p>The Green Tech Skillnet provides training opportunities in wind energy both for those working in the industry and for people looking to enter the wind industry. The Green Tech Skillnet is an enterprise-led network facilitating the workforce and development needs of the Irish renewable energy industry. It is promoted by Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), the representative body for the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential, economical and environmentally friendly part of the country&rsquo;s low-carbon energy future.  A number of renewable energy programmes are funded under HCI and Springboard+, among other Green Skills courses. This includes: a Graduate Diploma in Sustainable Energy Systems at DCU; a Postgraduate Diploma in Wind Energy at Dundalk Institute of Technology; Certificate in Energy Sustainability at South East Technological University; and MEng in Energy Infrastructure at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest.</p><p>Sustainable green skills are embedded in the Further Education and Training Strategy, which provides that climate change and sustainable development are key components of Further Education and Training (FET) processes.  FET will continue to contribute to the Government&rsquo;s call of action to prioritise energy, building and the environment in its processes.</p><p>It is envisaged that the SOLAS Green Skills Action Plan will contribute to clean technologies and the acceleration of the use of renewables. It will contribute to a greater awareness of energy efficiency and the benefits of retrofitting both public and private buildings.  The key skills areas to be addressed will include as follows:</p><p>- Creation of awareness of the Green Agenda through education;</p><p>- Increase of capacity in this area;</p><p>- Training and upskilling, which will contribute to green transition.</p><p>Currently, a number of &lsquo;Green Cert&rsquo; training courses are being delivered by Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  A &lsquo;Green Cert&rsquo; training course refers to a list of land-based courses, which provides qualifications in Horticulture; Agriculture; Forestry or Equine<b></b>Studies. Upon completion of the Green Cert training course, a qualified person will meet the requirements of a qualified farmer for the purposes of all Revenue and Department of Agriculture (DAFM) schemes. In 2021, there were 600 Learner Enrolments registered on ETB Green Cert training courses.  </p><p>In May 2021, an agreement was reached on a pilot project to be launched this year between the Campus des m&eacute;tiers et des qualifications d&rsquo;excellence international normand des &eacute;nergies (CEINE), Dublin &amp;amp; Dun Laoghaire ETB, Kerry ETB, Laois Offaly ETB, Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB and Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan ETB. These organisations will seek to build on their shared expertise in the field of Green Technologies Skills. ETB Further Education &amp;amp; Training will have a primary role in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s workforce has the required skills to meet its ambitious energy targets. LOETB has attended two meetings on the pilot for Green Technology Skills CEINE to date. The most recent meeting took place in October 2021 and it was agreed that the initial focus of the Programme would be on offshore wind turbine maintenance in conjunction with Kerry ETB. Other programmes of interest to LOETB, which were referenced at the meeting as potential &quot;start points&quot; of French-Irish cooperation include: Digital Technologies; Sustainable Agriculture and the transition from Peat to Renewable Energy, to name but a few.</p><p>The Wind Turbine Maintenance Technician (WTMT) Apprenticeship was launched in March 2022. Kerry ETB is the coordinating provider for the apprenticeship. It is estimated that there will be in the region of 18 registrations by year end.  It will run for a duration of 3 years and is offered at Level 6 on the NFQ. The rationale for this apprenticeship is that there is no current apprenticeship which provides the range of knowledge, skills and competencies needed for the role of wind turbine maintenance technician.  This Apprenticeship is for people who wish to pursue a career in the maintenance of large scale commercial wind turbines. It is designed to meet the needs of the growing Irish Renewable and Sustainable Energy sector. This apprenticeship will create a pathway into this career for school leavers or those who do not currently possess any relevant qualifications.</p><p>Kerry ETB recognised the shortage of training and education opportunities in this area, and in consultation with a number of employers implemented the highly successful wind turbine maintenance traineeship. This traineeship typically lasts 39 weeks and includes a minimum of 30 percent on-the-job training. Upon completion, trainees may receive a City and Guilds Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Electrical Power Engineering. This has been run in Kerry ETB&rsquo;s training facility since 2014 with very high placement rates for trainees involved. However, the entry requirements for this traineeship require potential trainees to hold one of the following:</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (Electrical)</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (MAMF)</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (Motor Mechanic)</p><p>- BEng with related work experience</p><p>The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications has established a cross-Departmental Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce to drive delivery and capture wider and longer term economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables in Ireland. This will include the identification of supporting infrastructure development and supply chain opportunities as Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind industry is developed.  </p><p>A cross-departmental Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce has been established to accelerate delivery of offshore wind actions and ensure alignment of activities in progress across Government.

This is an increase of nearly 40% compared to 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; year.</p><p>The attached table shows all apprenticeship registrations across the 16 ETBs for 2022, to the end of June. Where fewer than five apprentices were registered, the number is given as &quot;Less than 5&quot; in order to protect individuals' identities.</p><p>There have been a total of 3,057 apprentice registrations (2,667 craft registrations and 390 consortia-led registrations) to the end of June.</p><p>Significant financial supports have been introduced this year under the Action Plan:</p><p>- The annual Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the grant. This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p><p>- The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion.</p><p>Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p><p>- The National Apprenticeship Office will link potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p><p>- Sector-specific supports to be delivered through apprenticeship consortia to support SME employers.</p><p>- A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship.</p><p>There are currently 65 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 40 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic; Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding , Supply Chain Associate. So far this year, bar manager, wind turbine maintenance technician and transport operations &amp;amp; commercial driving apprenticeships have been launched. A further 16 programmes are in development. </p><p>This progress shows the continued appetite for apprenticeship as a valued option in our national skills architecture. </p></reply>

They are primarily designed for unemployed people, who are experiencing difficulty in gaining entry to the labour market.

Fifteen meetings have taken place this year.</p>  <p>  As a country, we know that we need to dramatically increase the supply of all types of housing and accommodation, including student accommodation. That is why the Government has launched Housing for All, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage setting out a series of actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis. The plan is backed by the largest housing budget in the history of the State to transform our housing system, in excess of &euro;20 billion. </p>  <p>  In recent weeks I have met with the presidents and chairs of all the traditional universities and technological universities to discuss any immediate proposals they may have identified or be able to identify in relation to any additional student accommodation provision that may be pursued in the short to medium terms and my Department is continuing to liaise with the higher education institutions in this regard. </p>  <p>  In this context the Department understands that hundreds of additional bed spaces are to be made available by HEIs for the start of the forthcoming academic year and that in addition a major development of 674 additional bed spaces underway at NUI Galway is expected to be delivered later in the academic year. </p>  <p>  As with housing and accommodation policy more generally, there are significant issues to be considered including with respect to financing and funding, affordability issues, addressing viability gaps for developments, complying with State aid rules and ensuring value for money.  The potential for interventions, taking account of these issues, is being considered in collaboration with relevant Departments across Government.  I will be attending the Cabinet Housing next week to discuss student accommodation policy to discuss this further with my Cabinet colleagues.</p></reply>

In particular my Department consults with the Department of Social Protection on an ongoing basis around various support schemes available to students in both Departments. </p>  <p>  Students in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) are not eligible for maintenance support under the student grant scheme, as this would result in a duplication of income support payments. However, students in receipt of BTEA, may be considered for SUSI fee supports up to a maximum of &euro;6,270.</p>  <p>  Under the third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021, which expired in December 2021, Lone parents were identified as a target group that are currently under-represented in higher education. The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund is the funding mechanism that supports the implementation of the NAP through its three Strands &ndash; Strand 1 supports access to initial teacher education, Strand 2 provides a three-tiered bursary scheme to NAP target group students and Strand 3 supports regional clusters of higher education institutions with the aim of attracting additional students from groups currently under-represented in higher education.  All three strands support the inclusion of Lone Parents. </p>  <p>  It is a condition of the 1916 Bursary Fund that at least 20% of bursaries be made available to Lone Parents.  Since the commencement of PATH 2, over the last 4 years a total of 235 Lone Parents were allocated a 1916 Bursary, exceeding the 20% requirement each year.  </p>  <p>  The new National Access Plan will succeed the third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education. Work on finalising the next Plan is almost complete. My Department and the HEA has led a public consultation process and has engaged with a wide range of stakeholders in the preparation of this Plan. The New Plan seeks to target underrepresented students, vulnerable students or students who have experienced disadvantage and therefore face challenges in accessing higher education and experiencing belonging in higher education.</p></reply>

For the majority of apprenticeships, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. On that basis any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in the determination of apprenticeship pay or training rates. However, it is important to note that as employees, eligible apprentices are also entitled to access general employment supports through the social welfare system. This option is open to any employee, apprentice or not, who finds themselves in difficulty. There are allowances paid to apprentices and we are examining these in the context of the upcoming Estimates process. </p></reply>

Under the Plan there will be increased online visibility regarding apprenticeship engagement and development processes for employers/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeships. Applications for new apprenticeship development are open on an ongoing basis, allowing employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis in all sectors of the economy.</p><p>Development of new apprenticeship programmes has continued despite pandemic challenges. There are currently 65 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 40 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021: arboriculture, equipment systems engineer, healthcare assistant, principal engineer &ndash; professional doctorate, recruitment executive, sales, scaffolding and supply chain associate.</p><p>So far this year, bar manager, wind turbine maintenance technician and transport operations &amp;amp; commercial driving apprenticeships have been launched. Programme development has been approved for programmes in areas such as farming, horticulture, finance, manufacturing, construction, cybersecurity and ICT, with several other programmes at the initial proposal stage. A full list of apprenticeship programmes available and in development is attached.</p><p>Significant financial supports have been introduced this year under the Action Plan:</p><p>- The annual Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the grant. This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p><p>- The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion. </p><p>Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p><p>- The National Apprenticeship Office will link potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p><p>- Sector-specific supports to be delivered through apprenticeship consortia to support SME employers. </p><p>- A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship</p><p>- Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, included in the Higher Education Authority Bill, 2022, will widen the scope for new apprenticeship programmes in an expanded range of sectors. </p><p>The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p></reply>

The proposals, which will form part of the proposed new National Access Plan, will allocate ring-fenced funding of &euro;3 million a year to 2025 so higher education institutions can implement universal design and inclusive practices on their campuses, and enhance opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities in higher education. Funding in 2022 will be directed towards universal design and inclusive practices. This includes improving campus accessibility improvements such as supporting autism friendly campuses such as wayfinding apps, signage, small-scale capital works such as autism-friendly spaces such as sensory rooms or quiet zones. </p><p>These measures are to be put in place under a new PATH Strand 4: Universal Design for All and improving opportunities for Students with Intellectual Disabilities to engage in Higher Education. </p><p>PATH 4 (Programme for Access to Higher Education) aims to: </p><p>- support a more diverse student body in Higher Education that includes students with an intellectual disability </p><p>- support capacity building and embed universal design approaches for all, particularly students with autism and an intellectual disability in higher education </p><p>- develop policies and subsequent implementation plans to promote participation of students with intellectual disabilities in higher education </p><p>- advance a holistic student-centred partnership approach within the tertiary education sector which will enable students with an intellectual disability reach their potential. </p><p>A key priority of Future FET: Transforming Learning, the national Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is to ensure consistency of support for all learners, underpinned by a universal design approach. This approach aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners of diverse backgrounds and abilities. I was delighted to launch the <i>UDL for FET Practitioners Guidance</i>last summer which SOLAS and Education Training Boards Ireland [ETBI] partnered with AHEAD to develop, with substantial consultation and engagement with FET practitioners. This practical guidance document builds on existing good inclusion practices in the FET sector and outlines how universal design for learning principles and practices can help FET practitioners reduce barriers to learning by building and incorporating flexibility, accessibility, learner voice, and choice in the fabric of the learning interactions they design. SOLAS is continuing to develop the knowledge and resources that promote and drive consistent learner support, based on the UDL principles in partnership with key stakeholders.  </p></reply>

In August 2020, I wrote to all publicly funded HEIs outlining my commitment to tackling sexual violence and harassment in higher education and requesting a number of actions in this area, including the development of institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. In this regard, I have been advised that all publicly-funded HEIs now have such action plans in place. I have also expanded the remit of the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality to cover all areas of equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as oversight of the implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs.</p>  <p>  To assist institutions with implementation of the Framework, funding of over &euro;400,000 has been allocated by my Department to a number of initiatives since its launch. These initiatives have mainly focused on training, education and awareness raising initiatives. The HEA has allocated further funding of over &euro;500,000 towards consent workshops, the development of the anonymous report and support tool, and the intervention programme referred to by the Deputy. The HEA has allocated &euro;20,000 to support the roll out of a pilot of the online version of the programme referenced to all HEIs in 2022.  </p>  <p>  In January 2019 the Online Programme referenced by the Deputy was launched. The programme educates and empowers participants to recognise acts of sexual harassment and violence and to cultivate their capacity to demand a zero-tolerance approach to all such behaviour, enabled by their upskilling in making safe and effective interventions. Stepping in to identify and stop sexual harassment and violence rightly places the spotlight on the perpetrator and their behaviour whilst providing support for the vulnerable party. Each intervention can be both informative and transformative for the parties involved. Through targeted training, these interventions can be normalised, and ultimately identify a new level of expectation, and a new normal for all in society. </p>  <p>  This training is a key targeted educational initiative to support staff and students in higher education to identify and challenge all forms of sexual harassment and violence. </p>  <p>  The Intervention programme has advised that it has responded to the growing interest from second levels schools by developing a pilot Intervention programme training programme. This was initially developed in collaboration with 7 Cork City and county schools. Training has subsequently been delivered to 140 teachers, and it is being rolled out in 45 schools.</p></reply>

A key ambition is to ensure that supports and opportunities are provided for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, people who are most marginalised and people with special and additional needs and assisting them in accessing and progressing through tertiary education.</p>  <p>  The new National Access Plan, a Strategic Action Plan for Equity of Access, Participation and Success 2022-2028, (NAP), which is almost complete, will continue to support increased participation in Higher Education for students with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new plan seeks to continue to target under-represented students as well as vulnerable students or students who have experienced disadvantage and therefore face challenges in accessing higher education and experiencing belonging in higher education.</p>  <p>  &euro;5m was secured under Budget 2022 to support new pilot initiatives and enhance existing initiatives under the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund to address priority actions under the NAP, including new initiatives to support autistic students and those with an intellectual disability access third level education. </p>  <p>  A decision has been taken to ring-fence &euro;3m of this fund for a four year pilot period to support the implementation of PATH Strand 4: Universal Design and Engagement of Students with Intellectual Disabilities in Higher Education. (The allocation of the remaining &euro;2m to measures which will support the implementation of the new plan is currently under consideration).</p>  <p>  This important development will support all students with disabilities including autistic students and will help to build on the existing but limited provision already available in Higher Education Institutions for students with intellectual disabilities.  </p>  <p>  PATH 4 will be implemented on a phased basis as follows:</p>  <p>  Phase 1 (2022) will comprise a once off fund totalling &euro;3 million for Universal Design, to be allocated to higher education institutions in 2022. </p>  <p>  This will advance universal design and inclusive practices in higher education. It will support student success for all students and learners in higher education and will be of particular benefit to students with special educational needs, including students with autism. Phase 1 will allow the sector to prepare and build/enhance capacity for engagement in Phase 2 of Path 4. It will enhance commitment to universal design and inclusive practice across the sector, which will also benefit the broader category of students with Special Educational Needs including students with autism.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 will involve a three-year pathfinding pilot to support an enhancement of course provision for students with intellectual disabilities and to inform future policy considerations for students with intellectual disabilities.</p>  <p>The procurement of expertise to support the Department and HEA is planned to support the management of a structured engagement process (including engagement with learners themselves) to design an appropriate call for proposals for students with an intellectual disability in ways that facilitate appropriate evaluation.  </p></reply>

These include:</p><p>-Increasing the grant payment for all those in receipt of a maintenance grant by &euro;200;</p><p>-Increasing the qualifying thresholds for the standard rate of maintenance by &euro;1,000;</p><p>-Changing the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant to help students who live further away from college;</p><p>-This is in addition to measures I introduced in Budget 2021 i.e. Increasing the postgraduate fee grant from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and increasing the postgraduate fee grant income threshold.</p><p>I have committed to publishing an annual costs of education paper, which will set out the range of options to address costs, including changes to the Student Grant Scheme and student contributions.  This will seek to inform decision-making at Budget time regarding the measures which can be taken to continue to support students and their families.</p></reply>
