The original target of 8% and the revised target of 12% under the National Access Plan of new entrants to higher education with disabilities has now been exceeded. 12.2% of new entrants to higher education in 2019/20 declared a disability.</p><p>On the further education and training side, some 5.9% of enrolments in 2021, were reported as having at least one type of disability.  Enrolments were primarily concentrated among Adult Literacy, Community Education and PLC programmes.</p><p>While this all represents good progress, I want more to be done. </p><p>The new national Access Plan is currently being finalised and I expect will be published in the common months.</p><p>Students with disabilities will continue to be a priority group in the new plan with a particular focus on students with an intellectual disability.</p><p>The work to support learners with an intellectual disability will be supported with a new funding stream under the Programme for Access to Higher Education.  The PATH Strand 4 - &euro;12 fund over four years will be implemented in two phases.  </p><p>My Department will also continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review in keeping with the objective of enabling a greater number of students with disabilities to access opportunities in higher and further education in the future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-07a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070700064#WRB00400"><p>A core mission for my Department is to continue to advance efforts to ensure that Ireland offers learning opportunities to all who wish to pursue them on a lifelong basis, provides the right skills and competences to learners to succeed, and produces  further and higher education graduates, apprentices and trainees with the right skills to support our economy, society and essential public services.</p>  <p>  At an institutional and provider level this requires agility, responsiveness and continual engagement with employers to understand emerging and evolving skills needs.</p>  <p>  At a national level, the National Skills Council advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on how to secure delivery of these needs. Key high level trends identified at recent National Skills Council meetings include automation and digitisation, digital literacy and transversal skills. Information on these trends is then used to guide the implementation of key skills strategies and initiatives such as the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.</p>  <p>  Engagement with the national skills architecture has also informed the development of new undergraduate places for the coming academic year.  On 28th June, I announced the creation of close to 1,000 targeted places across areas of key skills needs. These places will be permanent additions in the system, and will be in areas including Healthcare, ICT, Architecture and Construction, Engineering and Environment.</p>  <p>  Apprenticeships are playing an increasing role in meeting our skills needs as a country.  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships with a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per year by 2025.  In 2021, a record 8,607 new apprentices were registered- an almost 40% increase on the figures from 2019, the last broadly comparable pre-pandemic year. Development of new apprenticeship programmes has continued despite the pandemic challenges with 65 apprenticeship programmes currently on offer.</p>  <p>  The further education and training sector also plays a critical role in meeting critical skills needs.  We are also working to strengthen the further education and training system under a new strategy for that sector.  This will help ensure that our tertiary education system as a whole equips our students with the knowledge, skills and expertise required to secure good quality, well paid and sustainable employment.  This includes building on traditional areas of strength such as healthcare and construction and building capabilities aligned with emerging skills needs, in areas related to sustainable development.  </p></reply>

There is a particular responsibility on those charged with educating the next generation in ensuring that their learners are equipped to lead the change more widely across society.</p>  <p>  I fully support the core principle underpinning the strategy that we must take a zero tolerance approach.  Everyone is entitled to a safe environment to study and work free from violence and harassment, and that informs the policy approaches and interventions that have been adopted across the sector. </p>  <p>  Tackling sexual violence and harassment has been and will continue to a particular policy priority for me and my Department. In fact, one of the very first actions I took after my appointment as Minister in 2020 was to write to all publicly funded higher education institutions outlining my commitment to tackling sexual violence and harassment in higher education and requesting that institutions take a number of actions in this area, including the development of institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. All publicly-funded institutions now have such action plans in place. </p>  <p>  The Framework for Consent in Higher Education, which was launched in 2019, has had funding of over &euro;400,000 allocated to a number of initiatives since its launch by my Department.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Higher Education Authority has allocated funding of over &euro;500,000 towards consent workshops, the development of the anonymous report and support tool, and the UCC Bystander intervention programme.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that these initiatives and any further actions required successfully deliver on the objective of securing zero tolerance of sexual harassment and gender based violence across the entire tertiary education sector.</p></reply>

SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the 16 Education and Training Boards have progressed a series of actions nationwide to support the goal of Fostering Inclusion. Such actions include the development and roll-out of a series of good practice guidelines and promoting the concept of inclusion across the Further Education and Training (FET) Sector. </p>  <p>  In this context, I was delighted to launch the &lsquo;Universal Design for Learning for FET Practitioners: guidelines last year.  SOLAS is also continuing to develop the knowledge and resources that promote and drive consistent learner support, based on UDL principles in partnership with key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Last year I allocated &euro;5.4 million on strategic projects to help students with disabilities in higher education institutions, which included a range of universal design initiatives.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced further funding for a range of new initiatives to support autistic students and those with an intellectual disability access third level education. The proposals, which will form part of the proposed new National Access Plan, will allocate ring-fenced funding of &euro;3 million a year to 2025 so higher education institutions can implement universal design and inclusive practices on their campuses, and enhance opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities in higher education.</p>  <p>  Funding in 2022 will be specifically directed towards universal design and inclusive practices. This includes improving campus accessibility improvements such as supporting autism friendly campuses such as wayfinding apps, signage, small-scale capital works such as autism-friendly spaces such as sensory rooms or quiet zones.</p></reply>

This is allocated by the HEA to HEIs through the recurrent grant. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;3m to underpin student well-being and mental health in higher education institutions was secured for each of the 2020/21 and 2021/22 academic years as part of the funding packages, to mitigate against the impact of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The HEA have advised my Department that although specific information on waiting times for appointments is not available, the additional funding over the past two years has resulted in all higher education institutions reporting a reduction in waiting times, with some institutions being in a position to offer rapid access resources. </p>  <p>  This funding has also enabled support services in institutions to use new platforms and communication channels to reach out to students, rather than waiting for students to contact their student mental health services.</p>  <p>  In the Further Education and Training area, learners may have access to internal psychological supports from qualified Education and Training Board personnel.  Funding for these supports are dispersed under general individual programme and learner support headings. SOLAS also allocates funding for Guidance, Counselling and Psychological Services for Youthreach participants.</p>  <p>  My Department, working with the HEA and SOLAS and the tertiary education institutions themselves will continue to work to ensure that there is appropriate access to mental health services for students and learners, including through the Estimates for 2023. </p></reply>

These measures include a new temporary tuition scheme, an extension of eligibility to Springboard, a new bursary scheme for those who wish to take SOLAS approved PLC courses and an extension of the Student Assistance Fund. </p>  <p>  The European Commission have also indicated to Member States to be flexible in their use of the national Erasmus grant to support displaced persons wishing to continue their full-time education, and my officials are now working with the HEA to put this in place.  Finally, existing supports for mental health and well-being provision in the HEIs will be extended to include displaced students.</p>  <p>  I am confident the series of supports outlined will address the needs of those displaced students and researchers and my officials and I will continue to closely monitor their implementation and the level of demand being sought, with the help of the NSR Helpdesk to ensure we meet the needs of these displaced students.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-07a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070700064#WRB01900"><p>I am acutely conscious of the serious concerns as strong inflationary pressures impact on the cost of living for all in our society and communities, including those working in the higher and further education and training sector.   </p>  <p>  The Government's Summer Economic Statement published earlier this week sets out the Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy which will seek to protect public services, allow us to introduce further measures to address the cost of living pressures in the autumn, and at same time maintain fiscally sustainable expenditure into the medium term.</p>  <p>  As far as pay levels are concerned, as the Deputy will be aware, WRC-facilitated talks with the public sector trade union movement to undertake a review under &ldquo;Building Momentum&rdquo; were recently adjourned and all sides are reflecting on their positions to seek to reach a mutually acceptable position.  I know that the official side will continue to engage positively, as they seek to address the concerns which have triggered the review process.</p>  <p>  I have engaged as Minister with staff representatives in higher education on issues of concern such as, for example, low pay and short-term contracts.  Clearly, a key issue is establishing the scale and scope of these issues.  In this regard, a recent HEA report indicated that 11% of headcount are hourly-paid in the technological sector, with 17% falling into this category in traditional universities. It is accepted that data collection of this category is challenging.  Institutional report of staff data under the Employee Control Framework will be one element which we will address with the sector in the context  of our wider reform discussions.  </p>  <p>  Funding the Future sets out the Government's objectives for funding higher education on a sustainable basis and my commitment to an ambitious programme of reform to be delivered alongside increased investment.  A key priority of this reform process is enhancing the quality and international standing of the higher education system across its three core missions of teaching, learning and research through investment in the higher education workforce. </p>  <p>  I am committed to working with our agencies, the sector and key stakeholders including staff representatives to ensuring that the adoption of a sustainable future model of funding will enable - amongst other objectives - steps to be taken to address the issue of precarious work in the sector.</p></reply>

This has been done in collaboration with the Irish Universities Association and Technological Higher Education Association and the National Advisory Forum for Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Doctoral Education.</p>  <p>  In February 2022, I wrote to the Presidents of Higher Education Institutions requesting that they undertake a sectoral exercise to agree a set of high-level principles to which all institutions can work towards. I asked that they undertake a feasibility study to determine the next steps in progressing towards greater consistency and transparency in arrangements for postgraduate researchers. This work is progressing and it is envisaged that this exercise will be completed in Autumn 2022.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Government is committed to meeting the ambition set out in Impact 2030, Ireland&rsquo;s national research and innovation strategy, that researchers and innovators working in Ireland should have the best possible experience and to make the biggest possible difference.</p>  <p>  On 1 July, the Taoiseach and I announced a new partnership between industry and the Government to recruit and retain research talent. </p>  <p>  Innovate for Ireland is an important collaboration between industry and the Government and will make a significant contribution to the aims of our research and innovation strategy.</p>  <p>  The initial phase of the Innovate for Ireland initiative will seek to attract up to 400 PhD high calibre students to undertake research in Ireland that tackles national and global grand challenges such as climate change and climate adaptation; global health and pandemics; water poverty; digital society; and cyber-security. </p>  <p>  An attractive package, including a stipend of &euro;28,000, will be awarded through the programme to the PhD students. This has been benchmarked against similar scholarship programmes internationally. The programme will embrace all relevant disciplines from Science, Technology and Engineering to Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.</p></reply>

Early intervention and early educational experiences are crucial in this regard. </p>  <p>  My Department, therefore, works collaboratively with the Department of Education applying those principles to support successful transitions to further and higher education, including from DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  Work on the development of the new National Access Plan (NAP) for the period 2022 - 2028 is almost complete. It is my intention to bring a Memorandum to Government on the new NAP shortly and publish the strategy early in the next quarter.  </p>  <p>  Priority groups under the new NAP will continue to include students from socio-economically disadvantaged groups that have low participation in higher education. The indicators that help to inform progress on NAP implementation and the delivery of increased equity of access include entry to higher education from students who have attended DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  There has been demonstrable success in supporting transitions from DEIS schools to higher education.  At the commencement of the last National Access Plan in 2015, 3,959 students entered higher education. By the 2020/21 academic year, this had increased to 5,320 new entrants from DEIS schools.  </p>  <p>  This finding is in line with a Department of Education report from 2021 which noted an increase in the transition rates of those attending DEIS schools to higher education in 2020.  </p>  <p>  These transitions have been supported in a variety of ways including the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) programme, the Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) and the Education and Training Boards Ireland work on supporting DEIS learner&rsquo;s transition to FET.</p>  <p>  We will continue to measure entry to higher education for those attending DEIS schools over the lifetime of the new Plan to ensure we maintain a high level of ambition for all of our learners.</p></reply>

This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190m paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students.  </p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.  In advance of the Budget, my Department will be publishing, for the first time, a costs of education paper which will set out the possible policy options, and their indicative costs, to aid public discussion on how we should prioritise any interventions to address costs of education. </p>  <p>  I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the student contribution is too high, and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families.  </p>  <p>  I also recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education. </p>  <p>  My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole.</p></reply>

Prior to the establishment of this resource, Ukrainian students were contacting individual higher education institutions (HEIs) creating challenges in obtaining an accurate picture of the demand for places and mitigating against ensuring a consistent approach by each HEI to issues arising.</p>  <p>  The National Student and Researcher (NSR) Helpdesk is central to determining the demand, as well as ensuring consistency in terms of the response.  It is currently gathering data on enquiries made to all HEIs in Ireland, as well as those made directly the Helpdesk itself and will start working with students on their admissions applications in the coming weeks.  This will allow my Department to get a better picture of the level of demand for places.</p>  <p>  On 21 June, I secured agreement from Government to introduce a series of measures to help these displaced students and researchers. These measures include a new temporary tuition scheme, an extension of eligibility to Springboard, a new bursary fund for those who wish to take SOLAS approved PLC courses and an extension of the Student Assistance Fund. The European Commission have indicated to Member States to be flexible in the use the national Erasmus grant, which can be used to support those displaced persons wishing to continue their full-time education here, and officials of my Department are now working with the HEA, in its role as the National Agency for Erasmus for higher education, to put these supports in place.  Finally, existing supports for mental health and well-being provision in the HEIs will be extended to include displaced students.</p>  <p>  A Working Group on English Language for Academic Purposes (EAP) was set up under the auspices of the National Steering Group, and proposals to ensure displaced students entering into the Irish higher education sector have the requisite English language skills are being finalised.  I expect to have their conclusions by the end of this week. </p>  <p>  My officials and I have been working proactively with the sector to facilitate the continued education of these displaced students and researchers. I want acknowledge the contribution all those in the further and higher education sectors who have responded generously in assisting my Department to identify and respond to the needs of displaced students and staff.</p></reply>

It is my intention to progress measures to reduce the cost of education for students and families through changes to the Student Grant Scheme over time. </p>  <p>  This will build on improvements I have already made to the student grant scheme over the past two Budgets including improvements to postgraduate supports in Budget 2021 and a range of changes for the coming academic year.  From this coming September, there will be an increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant.

There is a broad range of courses in STEM related areas. </p>  <p>  HCI Pillar 3 will deliver 24 projects in higher education institutions, 20 of which involve collaborations between institutions. These projects also have a strong focus on STEM.</p>  <p>  The TU Dublin led Convene project has introduced two new initiatives to support and develop enterprise leaders: an Executive Ph.D. for Enterprise-Based Leaders and an MBA in Life Sciences Leadership (starting Sept 2022). Convene and the TU Dublin Graduate School of Business and School of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences have collaborated with the 30% Club. This will offer two scholarships for successful women applicants to boost gender representation in the Life Sciences sector.</p>  <p>  It is also vital that we ensure that apprenticeships are seen as an option by people across society.  Only a very small proportion of apprentices are women, and it is vital that we support greater diversity.  That is why I announced a new gender-based bursary for apprenticeship employers. The bursary, which is worth &euro;2,666, is available to employers who employ apprentices on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender.</p>  <p>  These initiatives will be supported through wider moves to drive gender equality in the higher education system, including through the National Gender Equality Dashboard for Higher Education Institutions; the Athena Swan Charter and the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative (SALI) which is increasing the number of women involved in decision making roles in higher education.</p></reply>

Students can now earn up to &euro;6,552 during non-term time in 2022 without being concerned that it will affect their eligibility for a student grant in the academic year 2023/2024.  The main support available to students is the Student Grant Scheme administered by SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland). The scheme provides maintenance and fee grant support for eligible students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  Reckonable income under the Student Grant Scheme is household income from all sources including income from a student&rsquo;s employment. However, income from a student&rsquo;s employment which represents holiday earnings outside of term time but within the reference period can be deducted from the total reckonable income assessed.  When assessing reckonable income under the Student Grant Scheme it is the previous year&rsquo;s income that is assessed. Therefore applications to the awarding authority (SUSI) for the academic year 2023/2024 are assessed based on household income earned in 2022 (1st January to 31st December 2022) so a change of this nature would be reflected in the Student Grant Scheme for 2023/2024 as it is only at that stage that SUSI would consider income that was earned in non-term time during 2022.  </p></reply>

This includes over 700 final year apprentices who were fast-tracked to complete their qualification.</p>  <p>  The very welcome sustained growth in apprenticeship registrations has compounded Covid-related pressures on access by craft apprentices to off-the-job training. </p>  <p>  Implementation of a major response plan to address the waitlists is well advanced. This includes:</p>  <p>  - Capital funding of &euro;20m was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade facilities. </p>  <p>  - Further funding of &euro;17m has been provided to SOLAS and the HEA to address backlogs, &euro;6 million of which is being invested in additional instructors, with over 100 additional posts approved.</p>  <p>  - Reform measures were also implemented to help clear the lists, including changed delivery structures for off-the-job training.</p>  <p>  Based on the end of May monthly figures (the most up to date figures available) there are 8,481 apprentices waiting to access off the job training.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the remainder of the Covid-19 backlog is cleared and the system has the capacity to meet the training needs of rapidly increasing numbers of apprentices, expansion of the apprenticeship system is continuing in 2022. In particular, further major investment in workshops and staff is planned for this year.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are in continuous engagement with SOLAS, the HEA and other partners on the matter of the backlog and it is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training for phases 4 and 6 will be cleared later this year.  The majority of phase 2 waiting lists is expected to be on target to be cleared by the end of 2022.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the recent increases in the cost of living, apprentices are primarily employees and all of the 65 apprenticeships are subject to a contract of employment. For the majority of apprenticeships, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. On that basis any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in the determination of apprenticeship pay or training rates. However, it is important to note that as employees, eligible apprentices are also entitled to access general employment supports through the social welfare system. This option is open to any employee, apprentice or not, who finds themselves in difficulty. There are allowances paid to apprentices and we are examining these in the context of the upcoming Estimates process.</p></reply>

These options include various Adult and Community Education Programmes; PLC courses, Skills to Compete and Skills to Advance courses, Youthreach, as well as Apprenticeships and Traineeships. Tanagh Outdoor Education Centre also provides a range of specialised programmes.</p>  <p>  The Letterkenny Campus of Atlantic Technological University has since 2019, collaborated with Monaghan Institute to offer a level 7 Degree in Health and Social Care on an outreach basis.  My objective of encouraging the development of a more integrated tertiary education system is intended to increase opportunities for this and for other types of collaboration between higher and further education in the future.  </p>  <p>  The FET provision in County Monaghan, as across the country, is being supported and expanded by the investment under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, the Adult Literacy for Life Strategy and Future FET: Transforming Learning, the FET strategy 2020-2024.</p>  <p>  CMETB is leading one of 10 projects, which is funded nationally by SOLAS under the Skills to Advance Innovation for Collaboration Fund.  This project, Upskilling of the Food Sector for the Future through action learning, focusses on identifying key skills for the future for the Food Sector and applying modern technology to design and deliver an approach, which will deliver agreed skills in a timely manner.  It is envisaged that once this model is validated, it will provide a national framework for supporting SMEs and LEOs in the future.</p>  <p>  It is also important to set-out these plans in the context of the border regions.  The demand for skills does not stop at the border and for this reason, I fully endorse the development of cross-border projects in conjunction with the Regional Colleges in Northern Ireland.  This measure will not just address skills provisions, but also ensure compatible education and training provisions in all regions.  I believe that the new PEACE PLUS programme will provide further opportunity for these collaborations to flourish.</p>  <p>  Finally CMETB has identified a project associated with Monaghan Institute for possible funding under the FET College of the Future Major Projects Fund, a new capital investment programme for the FET sector.  This capital investment programme will support additional capacity, upgrading and enhancement of infrastructure in the FET sector, in line with the FET College of the Future principles as set out in the Future FET Strategy.

This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190m paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students.  </p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.  In advance of the Budget, my Department will be publishing, for the first time, a costs of education paper which will set out the possible policy options, and their indicative costs, to aid public discussion on how we should prioritise any interventions to address costs of education. </p>  <p>  I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the student contribution is too high, and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families.  </p>  <p>  I also recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education. </p>  <p>  My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole.</p></reply>

The Plan seeks to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum, across a wide range of programmes, by 2025.</p><p>The expansion of apprenticeship across all sectors has widened the impact of apprenticeship in areas of skills shortage such as engineering, retrofitting, technology and fintech. Under the Plan there will be increased online visibility regarding apprenticeship engagement and development processes for employers/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeships. Applications for new apprenticeship development are open on an ongoing basis, allowing employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis in all sectors of the economy.</p><p>Development of new apprenticeship programmes has continued despite pandemic challenges. There are currently 65 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 40 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021: arboriculture, equipment systems engineer, healthcare assistant, principal engineer &ndash; professional doctorate, recruitment executive, sales, scaffolding and supply chain associate.</p><p>So far this year, bar manager, wind turbine maintenance technician and transport operations &amp;amp; commercial driving apprenticeships have been launched. Programme development has been approved for programmes in areas such as farming, horticulture, finance, manufacturing, construction, cybersecurity and ICT, with several other programmes at the initial proposal stage.

This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p><p>- The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion.</p><p>Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p><p>- The National Apprenticeship Office is linking potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p><p>- A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship</p><p>- Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, included in the Higher Education Authority Bill, 2022, will widen the scope for new apprenticeship programmes in an expanded range of sectors.</p><p>The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p></reply>

This is demonstrated by the broad range of initiatives that have been introduced, or are being planned, to support the achievement of this objective over the past two years.</p><p>Over 43,600 students have already been approved for support through the Student Grant Scheme for 22/23. The recent review of the Scheme makes a number of recommendations on issues including the rates of grant, income thresholds, eligibility criteria and postgraduate support. It is my intention to progress measures to reduce the cost of education for students and families through changes to the Student Grant Scheme over time.</p><p>In this year&rsquo;s Budget I have made the first changes to SUSI undergraduate grant rates and eligibility thresholds in a decade, as well as changing the non-adjacency rules to benefit students who are commuting. Also students can now earn up to &euro;6,552 during non-term time in 2022 without being concerned that it will affect their eligibility for a student grant in 2023.</p><p>On 4<sup>th</sup>May I launched the Funding the Future framework which sets out my intention to implement a progressive range of measures to address costs as a barrier to education, in the context of overall Budgetary decision-making. </p><p>In this context, I want to see the student contribution in higher education reduced in a meaningful way over the course of future Budgets.</p><p>On accommodation affordability, restrictions have also been put in place to limit the amount that students can be required to pay up front for their accommodation.</p><p>I will be attending the Cabinet Committee on Housing next week to discuss student accommodation policy.  This will provide the opportunity to consider with my Government colleagues options for delivery of more student accommodation at affordable rental levels for students.</p><p>The distribution of laptops to disadvantaged students helps tackle the digital divide.  It is expected that 20,000 students will receive a laptop under the initiative.  The Devolved Capital Grant provides flexible capital funding to eligible higher education institutions to support small-scale building works and equipment purchase or renewal, including ICT.</p><p>The Department of Transport have introduced a new &quot;Youth Travel Card&quot; which will offer 50% discount on fares across the public transport network for those aged 19 to 23. </p><p>Finally, as set out in the Summer Economic Statement the Government is committed to further significant actions in Budget 2023 to address the serious cost of living issues currently confronting all in our community.</p></reply>

Collectively, these measures provided funding for 50,000 education and training places.</p>  <p>  Within the further education and training sector, the Skills to Compete initiative delivered through ETBs, working in tandem with INTREO offices, Regional Skills Fora, and Enterprise Ireland, supports those who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, to re-enter the workforce. The funding provided for 21,000 places on skills to Compete courses.  An additional 8,550 places were funded through Skillnet Ireland supported programmes, including via Skills Connect, which was launched to enable people reskill quickly, secure new roles within their sector, or undertake innovative conversion courses to access job opportunities in new sectors.</p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme was introduced  to support the continued recruitment and retention of apprentices across apprenticeship programmes during the COVID-19 period.  With provision for 10,000 places, the scheme ended for new applications on 31st December 2021.   Specific provision was also made available for 1,500 places under retrofit training and 1,600 places on the Skills to Advance initiative, led by SOLAS, which aims to equip employees with the skills to progress in their current job, or to take advantage of new job opportunities.</p>  <p>  In the higher education sector, the funding supported over 8,000 additional places on Springboard+ and HCI Pillar 1, modular programmes and post-graduate places under the Postgraduate Skills Provision programme.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to invest in the 2022 Budget across these measures to strengthen the financial position of universities and provide capacity for extra students and support and develop apprenticeships by funding a new employer apprenticeship grant and establishment of a new Apprenticeship Office.   We are also investing to upskill people in the key skills areas of the economy, such as for climate and low carbon initiative and we continue to support the upskilling of employees via Skillnet Ireland and Skills to Advance.</p></reply>

This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190m paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students.  </p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.  In advance of the Budget, my Department will be publishing, for the first time, a costs of education paper which will set out the possible policy options, and their indicative costs, to aid public discussion on how we should prioritise any interventions to address costs of education. </p>  <p>  I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the student contribution is too high, and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families.  </p>  <p>  I also recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education. </p>  <p>  My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole. </p>  <p>  In addition it is important to highlight the expanding pathways to post leaving cert education which are accessible to all learners as they prepare for their chosen career.  In addressing this, as part of budget 2022, we have removed the Post Leaving Certificate participant contribution fee of &euro;200. This will come into effect in September 2022.  </p>  <p>  We are working hard to introduce new apprenticeship programmes, such as the ones in bar managing and wind turbine maintenance which we launched in March, and we have also improved the financial incentives on offer to employers to take on apprentices, particularly female ones.</p>  <p>  We are also working hard to improve pathways from further to higher education as part of our Unified Tertiary System strategy. There should be no barriers for students who want to pursue their chosen educational and career goals.</p>  <p>  For the academic year 2022/23, we will also see significant enhancements to the financial supports that students who need them most receive through the Student Grant Scheme; where:</p>  <p>  - There will be an increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant;</p>  <p>  - The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant will be increased by &euro;1,000;</p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant will be reduced from 45km to 30km.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding by way of the Students Assistance Fund to students in eligible Higher Education Institutions who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  The total allocation for the Fund in the 2021/22 academic year, including additional Covid supports, is &euro; 18.5 million.</p></reply>

The Plan promotes general access, diversity and inclusion in apprenticeship through targeted actions to encourage participation from under-represented groups including people with disabilities, women and those from ethnic minorities.</p>  <p>  Targets and interventions for specific groups will be detailed through an Equity of Access subcommittee of the National Apprenticeship Alliance to ensure that the voice of under-represented groups is integral to the further development of the apprenticeship system. It is envisaged that the subcommittee will include representation from second-level, community education, youth justice programmes, broader FET provision, and higher education.</p>  <p>  The National Apprenticeship Office will increase the visibility of underrepresented groups in apprenticeship literature and promotional material to reflect the participation and positive experience of people from all backgrounds and communities, as well as the availability of assistive supports.</p>  <p>  The actions set out in the Plan build on the outcomes of the 2018 Review of Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship. This has already resulted in a significant widening of measures to support increased visibility of apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  Specific immediate actions in the Action Plan include: </p>  <p>  - Extension of the female bursary of &euro;2,666, which was paid to employers of female apprentices on the 25 craft apprenticeships, to encourage them to employ minority-gender apprentices to all apprenticeship programmes with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. </p>  <p>  - All apprentice jobs are advertised on www.apprenticejobs.ie, with information on apprenticeship now accessible from the CAO website. A dedicated apprentice guidance line has been established to support this initial period of increased visibility of apprenticeship to school leavers</p>  <p>  Other actions which will be delivered, including through the Equity of Access subcommittee include:</p>  <p>  - Access to apprenticeship programmes and pre-apprenticeship courses will be clearly labelled, with progression routes into apprenticeship clearly identified and information on these courses will be published on www.apprenticeship.ie.</p>  <p>  - An employer survey will determine baseline attitudes and knowledge of supports available to employers for supporting employees with a disability. </p>  <p>  - Participation targets for under-represented groups, and additional specific actions to support those target groups, will be set with the Equity of Access Subcommittee and monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that interventions supporting increased diversity within the apprentice population.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these measures and the implementation process for the Action Plan for Apprenticeship overall will have a significant impact in ensuring greater diversity in the apprenticeship population as a whole.</p></reply>

The Plan seeks to deliver on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum, across a wide range of programmes, by 2025.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan is based on feedback from enterprise, the education and training sector and apprentices themselves, among others, and we have listened to the issues and concerns raised.</p>  <p>  Nobody understands the skills employers need better than the employers themselves and without their engagement there can simply be no apprenticeships or places on those programmes. That is why we are driving supports, both financial and non-financial, to encourage and support their engagement. </p>  <p>  Significant financial supports have been introduced this year under the Action Plan:</p>  <p>  - The annual Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the grant. This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p>  <p>  - The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion.</p>  <p>  Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p>  <p>  - The National Apprenticeship Office will link potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p>  <p>  - Sector-specific supports to be delivered through apprenticeship consortia to support SME employers.</p>  <p>  - A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship.</p>  <p>  - Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, included in the Higher Education Authority Bill, 2022, will widen the scope for new apprenticeship programmes in an expanded range of sectors.</p>  <p>  The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p></reply>

As part of the last Budget, I prioritised a number of changes to the SUSI scheme which will benefit learners in the coming academic year.</p>  <p>  All student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, will increase by &euro;200 per year. </p>  <p>  The qualifying income thresholds, except the special rate which is broadly aligned with social protection payments have increased by &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  I have also introduced changes to the criteria for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant which means that from September 2022, the qualifying distance for the non-adjacent rate of grant is reduced from 45km to 30km. In this way the scheme is responsive to eligible students who reside further away from college by providing an increased rate of student maintenance grant. </p>  <p>  These changes will benefit thousands of students and will build on the improvements that have already been made in the current academic year&rsquo;s student grant scheme.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding by way of the Students Assistance Fund to students in eligible Higher Education Institutions who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  The total allocation for the Fund in the current academic year, including additional Covid supports, is &euro;18.5 million.</p>  <p>  To inform the future direction of student supports, I commissioned the review of the Student Grant Scheme, which was published on 4th May. This provides a strong evidence basis for policy interventions to support students and their families.  The research confirmed that the rate of grants for undergraduate student supports provided under the Student Grant Scheme has been relatively unchanged over the previous number of years due to budgetary constraints while over the same period the cost of living for students has increased by 25%. </p>  <p>  My Department will be taking forward implementation of the Student Grant Scheme review. This will include the publication of a costs of education paper prior to the forthcoming Estimates. This will set out options for changes to the Student Grant Scheme and other measures to facilitate public discussion, including in the House, on what measures should be prioritised to support learners and their families.</p></reply>

Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole. This process is critical to enabling a number of key reforms, protecting quality and ensuring a fit for purpose sector which is enabled to evolve and adapt to future challenges. </p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that implementing the funding and reform framework will improve quality of outcomes from tertiary education, will strengthen the agility and responsiveness of higher education and will enhance the reputation of Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system internationally, including in international rankings. </p><p>The reforms and strategic outcomes identified by Government as a priority are as follows;</p><p>- Create unified knowledge and skills system which is balanced and integrated </p><p>- Strengthen representation in higher education for underrepresented groups </p><p>- Enhance quality by reducing the ratio of students to academic staff to comparable EU and OECD norms </p><p>- Reinforce alignment of sector with skills needs of the country &ndash; including those needed to deliver essential public services and meet national goals </p><p>- Drive forward a culture of lifelong learning.</p><p>I have established the HE Reform Implementation Group to bring about the benefits of &lsquo;Funding the Future&rsquo;. The work of this group and it working groups is intensively under way and all groups have met twice and are progressing their agendas. </p><p>As we move into the budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society; and working with aegis bodies will assess requirements and funding availability for 2023. </p></reply>

Our imperative is to ensure agility and responsiveness in the skills ecosystem. Through 2022 Ireland, in partnership with the OECD, is reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s skills strategies, policies and approaches to help us ensure that our skills system is future proofed. A core objective for my Department is to ensure that individuals and businesses are offered supports and pathways to quality education, upskilling and reskilling opportunities.</p><p>The National Training Fund supports initiatives including:</p><p><b>- </b>Skills to Advance is an employee development policy framework which enables targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce; </p><p>- Skills to Compete are a range of programmes to respond to the need for activation, upskilling and reskilling;</p><p>- Springboard+ provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need;</p><p>- Human Capital Initiative (HCI) range of programmes which seek to ensure that the higher education system as a whole responds to the constantly evolving skills needs of the economy;</p><p>- Skillnet Ireland provides subsidised training to business through learning networks operating nationwide and across all sectors.</p><p>The Green Tech Skillnet provides training opportunities in wind energy both for those working in the industry and for people looking to enter the wind industry. The Green Tech Skillnet is an enterprise-led network facilitating the workforce and development needs of the Irish renewable energy industry. It is promoted by Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), the representative body for the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential, economical and environmentally friendly part of the country&rsquo;s low-carbon energy future.  A number of renewable energy programmes are funded under HCI and Springboard+, among other Green Skills courses. This includes: a Graduate Diploma in Sustainable Energy Systems at DCU; a Postgraduate Diploma in Wind Energy at Dundalk Institute of Technology; Certificate in Energy Sustainability at South East Technological University; and MEng in Energy Infrastructure at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest.</p><p>Sustainable green skills are embedded in the Further Education and Training Strategy, which provides that climate change and sustainable development are key components of Further Education and Training (FET) processes.  FET will continue to contribute to the Government&rsquo;s call of action to prioritise energy, building and the environment in its processes.</p><p>It is envisaged that the SOLAS Green Skills Action Plan will contribute to clean technologies and the acceleration of the use of renewables. It will contribute to a greater awareness of energy efficiency and the benefits of retrofitting both public and private buildings.  The key skills areas to be addressed will include as follows:</p><p>- Creation of awareness of the Green Agenda through education;</p><p>- Increase of capacity in this area;</p><p>- Training and upskilling, which will contribute to green transition.</p><p>Currently, a number of &lsquo;Green Cert&rsquo; training courses are being delivered by Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  A &lsquo;Green Cert&rsquo; training course refers to a list of land-based courses, which provides qualifications in Horticulture; Agriculture; Forestry or Equine<b></b>Studies. Upon completion of the Green Cert training course, a qualified person will meet the requirements of a qualified farmer for the purposes of all Revenue and Department of Agriculture (DAFM) schemes. In 2021, there were 600 Learner Enrolments registered on ETB Green Cert training courses.  </p><p>In May 2021, an agreement was reached on a pilot project to be launched this year between the Campus des m&eacute;tiers et des qualifications d&rsquo;excellence international normand des &eacute;nergies (CEINE), Dublin &amp;amp; Dun Laoghaire ETB, Kerry ETB, Laois Offaly ETB, Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB and Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan ETB. These organisations will seek to build on their shared expertise in the field of Green Technologies Skills. ETB Further Education &amp;amp; Training will have a primary role in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s workforce has the required skills to meet its ambitious energy targets. LOETB has attended two meetings on the pilot for Green Technology Skills CEINE to date. The most recent meeting took place in October 2021 and it was agreed that the initial focus of the Programme would be on offshore wind turbine maintenance in conjunction with Kerry ETB. Other programmes of interest to LOETB, which were referenced at the meeting as potential &quot;start points&quot; of French-Irish cooperation include: Digital Technologies; Sustainable Agriculture and the transition from Peat to Renewable Energy, to name but a few.</p><p>The Wind Turbine Maintenance Technician (WTMT) Apprenticeship was launched in March 2022. Kerry ETB is the coordinating provider for the apprenticeship. It is estimated that there will be in the region of 18 registrations by year end.  It will run for a duration of 3 years and is offered at Level 6 on the NFQ. The rationale for this apprenticeship is that there is no current apprenticeship which provides the range of knowledge, skills and competencies needed for the role of wind turbine maintenance technician.  This Apprenticeship is for people who wish to pursue a career in the maintenance of large scale commercial wind turbines. It is designed to meet the needs of the growing Irish Renewable and Sustainable Energy sector. This apprenticeship will create a pathway into this career for school leavers or those who do not currently possess any relevant qualifications.</p><p>Kerry ETB recognised the shortage of training and education opportunities in this area, and in consultation with a number of employers implemented the highly successful wind turbine maintenance traineeship. This traineeship typically lasts 39 weeks and includes a minimum of 30 percent on-the-job training. Upon completion, trainees may receive a City and Guilds Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Electrical Power Engineering. This has been run in Kerry ETB&rsquo;s training facility since 2014 with very high placement rates for trainees involved. However, the entry requirements for this traineeship require potential trainees to hold one of the following:</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (Electrical)</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (MAMF)</p><p>- Advanced Craft Certificate (Motor Mechanic)</p><p>- BEng with related work experience</p><p>The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications has established a cross-Departmental Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce to drive delivery and capture wider and longer term economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables in Ireland. This will include the identification of supporting infrastructure development and supply chain opportunities as Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind industry is developed.  </p><p>A cross-departmental Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce has been established to accelerate delivery of offshore wind actions and ensure alignment of activities in progress across Government.

This is an increase of nearly 40% compared to 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; year.</p><p>The attached table shows all apprenticeship registrations across the 16 ETBs for 2022, to the end of June. Where fewer than five apprentices were registered, the number is given as &quot;Less than 5&quot; in order to protect individuals' identities.</p><p>There have been a total of 3,057 apprentice registrations (2,667 craft registrations and 390 consortia-led registrations) to the end of June.</p><p>Significant financial supports have been introduced this year under the Action Plan:</p><p>- The annual Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the grant. This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p><p>- The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion.</p><p>Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p><p>- The National Apprenticeship Office will link potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p><p>- Sector-specific supports to be delivered through apprenticeship consortia to support SME employers.</p><p>- A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship.</p><p>There are currently 65 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 40 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic; Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding , Supply Chain Associate. So far this year, bar manager, wind turbine maintenance technician and transport operations &amp;amp; commercial driving apprenticeships have been launched. A further 16 programmes are in development. </p><p>This progress shows the continued appetite for apprenticeship as a valued option in our national skills architecture. </p></reply>

They are primarily designed for unemployed people, who are experiencing difficulty in gaining entry to the labour market.

Fifteen meetings have taken place this year.</p>  <p>  As a country, we know that we need to dramatically increase the supply of all types of housing and accommodation, including student accommodation. That is why the Government has launched Housing for All, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage setting out a series of actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis. The plan is backed by the largest housing budget in the history of the State to transform our housing system, in excess of &euro;20 billion. </p>  <p>  In recent weeks I have met with the presidents and chairs of all the traditional universities and technological universities to discuss any immediate proposals they may have identified or be able to identify in relation to any additional student accommodation provision that may be pursued in the short to medium terms and my Department is continuing to liaise with the higher education institutions in this regard. </p>  <p>  In this context the Department understands that hundreds of additional bed spaces are to be made available by HEIs for the start of the forthcoming academic year and that in addition a major development of 674 additional bed spaces underway at NUI Galway is expected to be delivered later in the academic year. </p>  <p>  As with housing and accommodation policy more generally, there are significant issues to be considered including with respect to financing and funding, affordability issues, addressing viability gaps for developments, complying with State aid rules and ensuring value for money.  The potential for interventions, taking account of these issues, is being considered in collaboration with relevant Departments across Government.  I will be attending the Cabinet Housing next week to discuss student accommodation policy to discuss this further with my Cabinet colleagues.</p></reply>

In particular my Department consults with the Department of Social Protection on an ongoing basis around various support schemes available to students in both Departments. </p>  <p>  Students in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) are not eligible for maintenance support under the student grant scheme, as this would result in a duplication of income support payments. However, students in receipt of BTEA, may be considered for SUSI fee supports up to a maximum of &euro;6,270.</p>  <p>  Under the third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021, which expired in December 2021, Lone parents were identified as a target group that are currently under-represented in higher education. The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund is the funding mechanism that supports the implementation of the NAP through its three Strands &ndash; Strand 1 supports access to initial teacher education, Strand 2 provides a three-tiered bursary scheme to NAP target group students and Strand 3 supports regional clusters of higher education institutions with the aim of attracting additional students from groups currently under-represented in higher education.  All three strands support the inclusion of Lone Parents. </p>  <p>  It is a condition of the 1916 Bursary Fund that at least 20% of bursaries be made available to Lone Parents.  Since the commencement of PATH 2, over the last 4 years a total of 235 Lone Parents were allocated a 1916 Bursary, exceeding the 20% requirement each year.  </p>  <p>  The new National Access Plan will succeed the third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education. Work on finalising the next Plan is almost complete. My Department and the HEA has led a public consultation process and has engaged with a wide range of stakeholders in the preparation of this Plan. The New Plan seeks to target underrepresented students, vulnerable students or students who have experienced disadvantage and therefore face challenges in accessing higher education and experiencing belonging in higher education.</p></reply>

For the majority of apprenticeships, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. On that basis any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in the determination of apprenticeship pay or training rates. However, it is important to note that as employees, eligible apprentices are also entitled to access general employment supports through the social welfare system. This option is open to any employee, apprentice or not, who finds themselves in difficulty. There are allowances paid to apprentices and we are examining these in the context of the upcoming Estimates process. </p></reply>

Under the Plan there will be increased online visibility regarding apprenticeship engagement and development processes for employers/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeships. Applications for new apprenticeship development are open on an ongoing basis, allowing employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis in all sectors of the economy.</p><p>Development of new apprenticeship programmes has continued despite pandemic challenges. There are currently 65 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 40 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021: arboriculture, equipment systems engineer, healthcare assistant, principal engineer &ndash; professional doctorate, recruitment executive, sales, scaffolding and supply chain associate.</p><p>So far this year, bar manager, wind turbine maintenance technician and transport operations &amp;amp; commercial driving apprenticeships have been launched. Programme development has been approved for programmes in areas such as farming, horticulture, finance, manufacturing, construction, cybersecurity and ICT, with several other programmes at the initial proposal stage. A full list of apprenticeship programmes available and in development is attached.</p><p>Significant financial supports have been introduced this year under the Action Plan:</p><p>- The annual Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per apprentice means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the grant. This will help to promote engagement with the non-craft programmes, including the development of new programmes.</p><p>- The gender-based bursary of &euro;2,666 is available for those who employ apprentices in the minority gender on any national apprenticeship programme with greater than 80% representation of a single gender. It is an expansion of the &lsquo;female bursary&rsquo; available to craft apprenticeship employers prior to 2022 and there are currently 42 programmes which meet the criterion. </p><p>Employer feedback during the consultation process of the Action Plan highlighted that non-financial supports were particularly important for SME employers. Recognising this, supports to be in place during 2022 include:</p><p>- The National Apprenticeship Office will link potential consortia members, education providers, and supporting consortia members and/or provide supports to build in-company training capacity.</p><p>- Sector-specific supports to be delivered through apprenticeship consortia to support SME employers. </p><p>- A development plan is to be delivered for a user-centred apprenticeship management system to simplify employer participation within and across apprenticeship</p><p>- Proposed amendments to the Industrial Training Act, 1967, included in the Higher Education Authority Bill, 2022, will widen the scope for new apprenticeship programmes in an expanded range of sectors. </p><p>The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p></reply>

The proposals, which will form part of the proposed new National Access Plan, will allocate ring-fenced funding of &euro;3 million a year to 2025 so higher education institutions can implement universal design and inclusive practices on their campuses, and enhance opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities in higher education. Funding in 2022 will be directed towards universal design and inclusive practices. This includes improving campus accessibility improvements such as supporting autism friendly campuses such as wayfinding apps, signage, small-scale capital works such as autism-friendly spaces such as sensory rooms or quiet zones. </p><p>These measures are to be put in place under a new PATH Strand 4: Universal Design for All and improving opportunities for Students with Intellectual Disabilities to engage in Higher Education. </p><p>PATH 4 (Programme for Access to Higher Education) aims to: </p><p>- support a more diverse student body in Higher Education that includes students with an intellectual disability </p><p>- support capacity building and embed universal design approaches for all, particularly students with autism and an intellectual disability in higher education </p><p>- develop policies and subsequent implementation plans to promote participation of students with intellectual disabilities in higher education </p><p>- advance a holistic student-centred partnership approach within the tertiary education sector which will enable students with an intellectual disability reach their potential. </p><p>A key priority of Future FET: Transforming Learning, the national Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is to ensure consistency of support for all learners, underpinned by a universal design approach. This approach aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners of diverse backgrounds and abilities. I was delighted to launch the <i>UDL for FET Practitioners Guidance</i>last summer which SOLAS and Education Training Boards Ireland [ETBI] partnered with AHEAD to develop, with substantial consultation and engagement with FET practitioners. This practical guidance document builds on existing good inclusion practices in the FET sector and outlines how universal design for learning principles and practices can help FET practitioners reduce barriers to learning by building and incorporating flexibility, accessibility, learner voice, and choice in the fabric of the learning interactions they design. SOLAS is continuing to develop the knowledge and resources that promote and drive consistent learner support, based on the UDL principles in partnership with key stakeholders.  </p></reply>

In August 2020, I wrote to all publicly funded HEIs outlining my commitment to tackling sexual violence and harassment in higher education and requesting a number of actions in this area, including the development of institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. In this regard, I have been advised that all publicly-funded HEIs now have such action plans in place. I have also expanded the remit of the HEA&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality to cover all areas of equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as oversight of the implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs.</p>  <p>  To assist institutions with implementation of the Framework, funding of over &euro;400,000 has been allocated by my Department to a number of initiatives since its launch. These initiatives have mainly focused on training, education and awareness raising initiatives. The HEA has allocated further funding of over &euro;500,000 towards consent workshops, the development of the anonymous report and support tool, and the intervention programme referred to by the Deputy. The HEA has allocated &euro;20,000 to support the roll out of a pilot of the online version of the programme referenced to all HEIs in 2022.  </p>  <p>  In January 2019 the Online Programme referenced by the Deputy was launched. The programme educates and empowers participants to recognise acts of sexual harassment and violence and to cultivate their capacity to demand a zero-tolerance approach to all such behaviour, enabled by their upskilling in making safe and effective interventions. Stepping in to identify and stop sexual harassment and violence rightly places the spotlight on the perpetrator and their behaviour whilst providing support for the vulnerable party. Each intervention can be both informative and transformative for the parties involved. Through targeted training, these interventions can be normalised, and ultimately identify a new level of expectation, and a new normal for all in society. </p>  <p>  This training is a key targeted educational initiative to support staff and students in higher education to identify and challenge all forms of sexual harassment and violence. </p>  <p>  The Intervention programme has advised that it has responded to the growing interest from second levels schools by developing a pilot Intervention programme training programme. This was initially developed in collaboration with 7 Cork City and county schools. Training has subsequently been delivered to 140 teachers, and it is being rolled out in 45 schools.</p></reply>

A key ambition is to ensure that supports and opportunities are provided for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, people who are most marginalised and people with special and additional needs and assisting them in accessing and progressing through tertiary education.</p>  <p>  The new National Access Plan, a Strategic Action Plan for Equity of Access, Participation and Success 2022-2028, (NAP), which is almost complete, will continue to support increased participation in Higher Education for students with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The new plan seeks to continue to target under-represented students as well as vulnerable students or students who have experienced disadvantage and therefore face challenges in accessing higher education and experiencing belonging in higher education.</p>  <p>  &euro;5m was secured under Budget 2022 to support new pilot initiatives and enhance existing initiatives under the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund to address priority actions under the NAP, including new initiatives to support autistic students and those with an intellectual disability access third level education. </p>  <p>  A decision has been taken to ring-fence &euro;3m of this fund for a four year pilot period to support the implementation of PATH Strand 4: Universal Design and Engagement of Students with Intellectual Disabilities in Higher Education. (The allocation of the remaining &euro;2m to measures which will support the implementation of the new plan is currently under consideration).</p>  <p>  This important development will support all students with disabilities including autistic students and will help to build on the existing but limited provision already available in Higher Education Institutions for students with intellectual disabilities.  </p>  <p>  PATH 4 will be implemented on a phased basis as follows:</p>  <p>  Phase 1 (2022) will comprise a once off fund totalling &euro;3 million for Universal Design, to be allocated to higher education institutions in 2022. </p>  <p>  This will advance universal design and inclusive practices in higher education. It will support student success for all students and learners in higher education and will be of particular benefit to students with special educational needs, including students with autism. Phase 1 will allow the sector to prepare and build/enhance capacity for engagement in Phase 2 of Path 4. It will enhance commitment to universal design and inclusive practice across the sector, which will also benefit the broader category of students with Special Educational Needs including students with autism.</p>  <p>  Phase 2 will involve a three-year pathfinding pilot to support an enhancement of course provision for students with intellectual disabilities and to inform future policy considerations for students with intellectual disabilities.</p>  <p>The procurement of expertise to support the Department and HEA is planned to support the management of a structured engagement process (including engagement with learners themselves) to design an appropriate call for proposals for students with an intellectual disability in ways that facilitate appropriate evaluation.  </p></reply>

Where a private family law matter is settled in court, Tusla does not have a mandate to intervene. Tusla does have a duty to intervene where they have been notified that a child is being abused or there is suspected abuse. Where an order is made in the family courts that involves Tusla and the care of the child is entrusted to the state, Tusla has a role to provide and monitor the care of the child.</p><p>Children who are subject to temporary court orders, such as Interim Care Orders, under the Child Care Act 1991 are accommodated in a variety of settings. Most children are placed in foster care and Interim Care Orders can continue for some time whilst awaiting conclusion of the court process. </p><p>Children in interim placements arising from these processes are cared for in the same way as all children in care and are subject to the same review process as set out in the Child Care Placement of Children in Foster Care Regulations 1995 and the Child Care Placement of Children in Residential Care Regulations 1995. </p><p>Under these regulations, care of these children is reviewed within the first six weeks of the placement, and every 6 months for the first two years and annually thereafter. When a child&rsquo;s placement changes, the cycle of reviews will start again. Care of children on Interim Care Orders are also under review in the courts as directed. </p><p>Children in voluntary care are also subject to the same foster care and residential care regulations. The Tusla National Model of Practice which promotes safety planning for each child with the support of the parents and their network, is also essential in providing a structure in the support and creation of safety for these children. </p><p>This model of practice promotes families caring for their own children where possible, with the support of their network and community. </p></reply>

This year DCEDIY and Tusla secured &euro;750,000 in Dormant Accounts Funding for the continuation of educational supports for care experienced children and young people. This is the second year of a two year programme funded by Dormant Accounts. The purpose of the funding is to support and assist care experienced young people achieve their full potential in education. </p><p>DCEDIY, in collaboration with Tusla, have agreed an approach to delivering these supports which comprises three strands, one of which is the Education and Training Bursary Scheme for Care Experienced Young People, which I launched on 15<sup>th</sup>June. </p><p>Care experienced young people over 18 years of age, who are not receiving financial support for their education from any other State source, can apply for a bursary of up to &euro;5,000. </p><p>Last year, the Bursary Scheme Committee approved 136 applications and just under &euro;185,000 was awarded to young people to support their further education or training.  Successful applications included the payment of fees for young people applying for new courses or training as well as those seeking to continue on an existing course or training.  </p><p>Applications for financial support for the hardware, software or equipment necessary to participate in courses were also considered. Examples of such requests included tools to complete an apprenticeship, uniforms for courses or hardware such as laptops or printers.  </p><p>Examples of the type of courses undertaken by the applicants included social care, beauty, nursing, hair dressing and legal and political studies. </p><p>The funding of courses and equipment for so many young people shows the success of this bursary scheme and I am very pleased that my Department and Tusla are able to provide it again in 2022.  </p><p>The application process opened on 15<sup>th</sup>June and is accessible through the Tusla website. </p><p>Since 2017, Tusla have been delivering a range of aftercare services and supports, including an aftercare allowance to support young people as they progress in their education and training. They are also entitled to the payment of their fees through the SUSI grant. </p><p>However, I am aware that at times there may be courses that young people wish to pursue that are not covered by SUSI and at other times courses may have additional unexpected costs. </p><p>While there are very strong supports for formal 3rd level courses, this scheme is to address the need for supports for other, often shorter courses, which are part of the incremental steps for young people building their careers. </p><p>In such instances this bursary scheme will be of real practical benefit and will improve access to educational opportunities. </p></reply>

The safety and protection of residents who disclose to IPAS that they are transgender is a priority for my Department. IPAS and all accommodation centres under contract to it, are committed to establishing safeguards to help protect residents from harassment and bullying.  IPAS has taken steps to accommodate the needs of residents that are transgender, and ensure the well-being of all residents.</p>  <p>  In addition the Integration and Supports operational policy being developed for the implementation of A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service, includes measures to assist LGBTI+ asylum applicants with specific vulnerabilities while their applications are being assessed.</p></reply>

On 14 March 2022, I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.</p>  <p>  Recommendations 8&ndash;12 relate to creating a Specialist Tracing Service that would take a two-pronged approach to identifying further cases of illegal birth registration. </p>  <p>  Firstly, it recommends a review and trace of the files flagged by Tusla during the Independent Review as raising suspicions of illegal birth registration, but which fell short of the amount of evidence in the St. Patrick Guild files. Secondly, it recommends creating a right of expedited review for persons who hold reasonable suspicions that they may have been the subject of an illegal birth registration.</p>  <p>  I accepted these recommendations and amended the Birth Information and Tracing Bill accordingly to provide a legal basis for a specialist tracing service. That legislation was signed into law by the President on 30 June 2022 and I commenced the first suite of provisions on 01 July to pave the way for information and tracing services to open in October 2022. </p>  <p>  I ensured that, alongside the establishment of the Contact Preference Register and the information campaign, provisions to establish the specialist tracing service for illegal birth registrations were also commenced.  With this legislative framework in place, and in line with the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s recommendations, I intend to formally request a review of files flagged by Tusla as raising suspicions of illegal birth registration.</p></reply>

This Steering Group includes a number of youth representatives as well as representatives of the wider youth sector. </p>  <p>  The European Year of Youth was officially launched at the Connect with Europe conference, which I was delighted to give an address at. The event showcased how young people can access opportunities in Europe through information and support initiatives like Eurodesk and Youth Wiki. Multiple other events are taking place throughout the year, and across the country, to celebrate the European Year of Youth. For example, my Department were proud to support L&eacute;argas&rsquo; national youth event &lsquo;All Aboard&rsquo;, in May. Over 200 young people from different background and counties, came together on a specially chartered train to raise awareness of local, national and European opportunities available to young people in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has provided &euro;200,000 in total to support a European Year of Youth Micro Grants Scheme being managed by L&eacute;argas. This brings the total available under the Scheme to &euro;295,000, with the remaining funding provided from the European Commission&rsquo;s grant and L&eacute;argas&rsquo; operational budget. </p>  <p>  The Micro Grants Scheme is open to youth organisations, local youth and community groups and organised groups of young people in other settings such as schools to apply for funding to carry out activities that support, celebrate, engage and listen to young people and that promote youth opportunities at a local, national and European level, in line with the objectives of the European Year of Youth. Following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, projects which support or aid the integration of young people from Ukraine have also been included in the Micro Grants scheme.  </p>  <p>  Micro Grants of between &euro;500 and &euro;5000 are available under this scheme and there are six deadlines over the course of the year to facilitate applications as much as possible. There has been significant demand for funding under the scheme to date, with &euro;160,652 awarded across 66 projects so far and I have been delighted to have this opportunity to support young people from all backgrounds to participate in a range of very worthwhile initiatives.</p></reply>

A recent review of the NCS showed that:</p>  <p>  - 38% families had more than half of their early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS;</p>  <p>  - 56% families had more money to spend due to the scheme; and</p>  <p>  - 28% families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it. </p>  <p>  I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability and sustainability.</p>  <p>  An Expert Group to develop a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector made recommendations to Government in December which were accepted in full. This new funding model is now beginning to be implemented to improve quality, affordability, sustainability and accessibility of services.</p>  <p>  The package of measures for the sector announced in Budget 2022 was informed by the Expert Group recommendations. The package includes a new Core Funding stream valued at up to &euro;221 million in a full year. Making early learning and childcare more affordable to parents and improving services' sustainability are central objectives of Core Funding, along with improving quality including through better terms and conditions for the workforce. </p>  <p>  A central condition of Core Funding will be that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also extended universal NCS subsidies for children of all ages up to 15, and changed how &lsquo;wraparound hours&rsquo; for NCS subsidies are determined. The Expert Group report also recommended increasing the NCS rates and this will also be implemented for future years.  </p>  <p>  Ensuring no fee increase, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for parents.  </p>  <p>  Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. A number of safeguards have been put in place to ensure no unintended outcomes of Core Funding including a funding guarantee and a Sustainability Fund which will be open to both private and community services.</p>  <p>  In order to contribute to services' stability and sustainability, Core Funding will be allocated based largely on capacity, as distinct from occupancy. Higher levels of funding will be available for capacity for younger children, to support the higher operating costs for these children arising from the higher staff ratio requirements. </p>  <p>  Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. </p>  <p>  Since August 2020, early learning and childcare services had been able to access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) without having to demonstrate a reduction in turnover. This continued to be available until the end of April. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years and that providers have continued to be sustainable.</p>  <p>  Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of Core Funding, between May and August a Transition Fund is available to providers. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is that providers agree not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. I am delighted to report that 95% of services have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into contract for the Transition Fund, contributing to both affordability for parents as well as sustainability of providers. </p>  <p>  As you can see, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years.</p></reply>

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group engaged in a widespread programme of stakeholder consultation in order to review the existing funding model for Early Learning and Childcare and develop a new funding model. Over the course of the two year project, the extensive programme of stakeholder consultation sought the views of parents, providers, the workforce, and other stakeholders, all of which is documented and publicly available.</p>  <p>  One of major recommendations of the Expert Group report was to introduce a new  supply-side funding stream based on capacity and incorporating funding for graduates and administrative support. Core Funding, which begins in September, is the new funding stream worth &euro;221 million in full year costs to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers. Core Funding allows for an estimated 19% increase in the total cost base for the sector.  </p>  <p>  My officials have engaged extensively with provider representatives and providers of all types, and continue to do so, via various fora, as the details of Core Funding are available. I, along with senior officials, have met with provider representative groups on a number of occasions and have maintained information, presentations, FAQs and other useful material online. </p>  <p>  My Department and I have engaged with providers throughout the development and implementation of the new funding model, and will continue to do so in the future. I met with the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum most recently on the 29th June, and this served as a useful opportunity to hear from a variety and diversity of stakeholders in the sector, following the publication of the funding agreement for Core Funding.  </p>  <p>  Core Funding is a new way of providing funding for the sector and addresses some disparities in the previous system of funding.  It is a fair and proportionate approach to distributing funding that is linked to the main drivers of providers' costs.  There is no a solid foundation in evidence for the concerns expressed by some that Core Funding will compromise services' viability.</p>  <p>  In examining all of the data available to the Department, including that provided by some provider representatives, there is no evidence about a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding.  </p>  <p>  Analysis of providers&rsquo; income and costs shows that services with the characteristics correlated with ECCE-only provision had the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision. Levels of income in excess of costs range from 14% to 23%, depending on the characteristic chosen. These figures compare to a sector median proportion of income in excess of cost of 4%. This was prior to increases in ECCE capitation rates and does not take account of the substantial investment in services during Covid-19 or the new Core Funding income that services will be eligible for.  </p>  <p>  Accounting for the proposed Employment Regulation Order rates currently being considered, Department estimates show that sessional pre-school services will receive income from the State through the ECCE programme that will cover staff costs and leave considerable room for overheads and surplus, or for any service that may choose to raise wages above anticipated new minimum rates. Core Funding constitutes additional income on top of ECCE capitation.</p>  <p>  Every year a number of services close and others open. Current data on service closures and openings are not markedly different to the trend in previous years. This data also shows that services close for a wide range of reasons including retirement of owners or other personal circumstances and only a minority relate to sustainability issues. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring more stability of income for services, and that is one of the key objectives of Core Funding.   </p>  <p>  The vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and less than 1% of services will see no change. No service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be put in place. This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.  This will be open to both private and community providers.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working with all providers who wish to enter into a Partner Service agreement with the Department to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good.</p></reply>

The General Scheme of the proposed Bill is published on my Department's website. The main purpose of the proposed legislation is to transpose elements of the EU Work Life Balance Directive and provide new rights to parents and carers in order to support a better work life balance.</p>  <p>  Under the proposed legislation, parents and carers will see a right to request flexible working, including the right to request compressed or reduced hours, the introduction of five days leave per year for serious medical care, and the extension of current entitlement to breastfeeding/lactation breaks under the Maternity Protection Acts from six months to two years, with corresponding positive impacts for the well-being of children. These proposals will complement family leave and other entitlements already in place and will provide additional flexibility.  It is anticipated that provisions which enable parents to spend more time with their children will bring significant benefits to those children as research has proved that children benefit from their care of their parents, particularly in the first years of life.  </p>  <p>  The proposals also reflect commitments in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, in the National Strategy for Women and Girls, and in the First 5 Strategy to develop greater family-friendly flexible working arrangements and support breastfeeding.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme has been referred to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting. The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General and will be brought to Government when completed.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme was also referred for pre-legislative scrutiny to the Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which published its report on 9 June.</p></reply>

My Department continues to monitor the issue. </p>  <p>  In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover, and recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to pay and conditions, with for example the average pay in the sector being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021.</p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early years educators or school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p>  <p>  In December last, I published Nurturing Skills, the Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022 to 2028. Actions in Nurturing Skills to develop career pathways and promote careers in the sector will complement efforts to improve pay and conditions of employment, to make the sector more attractive to potential workers. </p>  <p>  A key enabler for Nurturing Skills will be the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services. I began a process in December 2020, which examined the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee, which began meeting in December 2021.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced a new &euro;221m Core Funding stream which, among other objectives, will support service providers to meet new higher minimum rates of pay for the sector that may be negotiated through the Joint Labour Committee.</p></reply>

As part of this process I published <i>A White Paper to end Direct Provision and to Establish a new International Protection Support Service</i>on 26 February 2021. This paper sets out a new approach for accommodating applicants that seek International Protection in Ireland and will replace the current system.</p><p>Since the publication of the White Paper my Department has placed a significant focus on delivering the new model of accommodation and supports. A dedicated Transition Team has been established in the Department to drive implementation of the new model. Governance structures have put in place in the form of a Programme Board which includes representation from the NGO sector and an External Advisory Committee to oversee transition to the new system. The Board has met regularly over the past 12 months to review progress. </p><p>Significant progress has been made to establish the new accommodation model.  This work has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy, an ownership model and a funding model. Proposals in relation to the ownership model were brought to the Programme Board in November 2021 and approved by myself in January 2022. In collaboration with the Housing Agency a funding model for Approved Housing Bodies has been developed to support them in building a pipeline of Phase Two accommodation. Work is ongoing to finalise the details of the model with plans to launch it later this year. To date, 14 properties have been purchased for Phase Two accommodation and work to source and acquire more properties will continue for the remainder of 2022. </p><p>The Transition Team is developing an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out in the White Paper. In collaboration with the Local Authorities work is currently ongoing to design the supports that will be required at a local level. This includes the expansion of the current model of interagency working groups and resettlement and intercultural workers that is in place for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and establish a permanent integration system that will provide support both to programme refugees and to applicants for international protection.</p><p>Work is also ongoing to develop an integration fund, which will fund civil society organisations to support the integration of International Protection applicants. It will launch in the coming weeks.</p><p>As will be appreciated, the war in Ukraine has had an unavoidable impact on timelines for implementation of the White Paper, as staff in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were temporarily diverted to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations including members of the White Paper Transition Team. </p><p>The Department is working diligently to manage the response to the Ukraine crisis whilst continuing to progress the aims of the White Paper. Currently a review of project timelines is being undertaken with a view to presenting a revised implementation plan to the Programme Board.  This will take account of the delays that have arisen as a consequence of the Ukraine crisis and will consider its impacts on project implementation. </p><p>Notwithstanding the impact of the Ukraine crisis, the implementation of the new model is and will continue to be a key priority for my Department.</p></reply>

Mandated persons are people who have contact with children and/or families and who, because of their qualifications, training and/or employment role, are in a key position to help protect children from harm. Organisations classed as providers of relevant services under the Act are required to undertake a risk assessment and develop a Child Safeguarding Statement (CSS) setting out the procedures in place to manage any risk identified.</p>  <p>  The Children First Act operates side-by-side with the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children. The guidance sets out how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla and what organisations need to do to keep children safe.</p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay. </p>  <p>  Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. </p>  <p>  Tusla has an out of hours emergency number for AGS which provides advice to the AGS based on the circumstances and also can identify whether a child of concern is listed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS). The CPNS is a Tusla owned secure database, which lists children who are considered to be at ongoing risk of significant harm.</p>  <p>  There is a 24/7 'out of hours' social work team available in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork and on call social workers in other areas. Tusla has a network of emergency foster care placements for children in need of emergency care out of hours. </p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved. </p>  <p>  In April 2021, Tusla published research undertaken by National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) which examined the actions undertaken by Tusla social workers when AGS transfer custody of a child to their care, following the AGS removing the child under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. </p>  <p>  A total of 452 cases recorded in Tusla&rsquo;s Section 12 database for the period July 1st 2016 to June 30th 2017 were analysed. The findings showed that most of the children were aged 15 to 17 years and there were slightly more boys than girls. The research also showed that the most commonly reported reasons for invoking a Section 12 were: </p>  <p>  - Severe parenting difficulties </p>  <p>  - Parental Alcohol/Drug Abuse </p>  <p>  - Child behaviour difficulties.</p>  <p>  As the data for the report was collected in 2016/2017 many of the findings of the report, and subsequent recommendations, have been addressed through ongoing service development and improvement in Tusla, including, as mentioned, the standardised processes of communication between Tusla and AGS.</p>  <p>  In relation to children in institutions, HIQA inspect all Tusla children's residential centres and the Registration Unit in Tusla inspect and register voluntary and privately run children's residential centres. Reports of inspections are available on the HIQA and Tusla websites.</p></reply>

The aim of these inspections is to ensure effective service delivery and identify areas where improvement is required and where there are emerging risks within services.</p>  <p>  The inspection to which the Deputy refers was carried out on child protection and welfare and foster care services in the Cork area. As previous inspections of the services provided in Cork have identified ongoing challenges, the area is subject to risk-based inspections. This inspection was a risk-based inspection.</p>  <p>  The inspection took place at a time of significant change in the service area. There was a relatively new senior management team in place. The team was in the process of developing a programme in order to bring about change and address the significant backlogs in the area and to implement new systems for service delivery, which would be compliant with statutory regulations and national standards. It was acknowledged during the inspection that additional time and resources would be required to address the deficits and achieve a high standard of practice. </p>  <p>  Of the twelve standards inspected, 10 returned non-compliant judgements and two returned substantially compliant judgements. </p>  <p>  Following the inspection, Tusla has put in place an action plan and submitted that plan to HIQA. This plan has been accepted by HIQA. The progress of the plan is being closely monitored by Tusla and my Department will continue to liaise with Tusla senior management regarding quality improvement and risk management in the Agency. </p>  <p>  The action plan submitted by Tusla includes measures such as, but not limited to the following:</p>  <p>  - The establishment of an Inter-Agency Steering Group in the Cork area, to consider how the area can work in a more integrated way to support families awaiting services in a more timely manner;</p>  <p>  - Six additional social work posts have been approved to address the waiting lists;</p>  <p>  - The Social Work Graduate panel will be open to Cork.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, efforts have been made by my Department to address challenges identified in a number of service areas. In 2019, my Department established the Social Work Education Group (SWEG), with key stakeholders from social work employers (including Tusla), the higher education sector and representative bodies. The goal of the group is to increase the number of social work graduates from Irish universities.</p>  <p>  In March 2021, Tusla offered employment to all suitably qualified graduates. Following a recruitment process, 110 new graduates were offered roles within the Agency. </p>  <p>  Following representations by the DCEDIY and other stakeholders to the IDG on Economic Migration, and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, social workers were removed from the &lsquo;ineligible occupations list&rsquo;. As a result social workers from outside the EU/EEA are now eligible to apply for an employment permit since June 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this area.</p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007.</p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD. As the Deputy will be aware, the Optional Protocol is an international treaty that establishes procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the Convention. Ratification of the Optional Protocol is a commitment in the Programme for Government, to follow the State's first periodic review before the UN Committee.</p>  <p>  Due to delays at UN level, Ireland&rsquo;s appearance before the Committee will now be delayed, possibly for some time. In light of this, both Minister O'Gorman and I have indicated that we are open to earlier ratification, contingent on the State being in a position to meet its obligations thereunder. This is reflective of the State&rsquo;s long-standing approach to entering into binding international obligations in good faith, and at a point where the State is in a position to meet its obligations.</p>  <p>  Work is being undertaken on the process of examining the requirements for ratification, including the legal steps needed in advance of ratification.  This work is being progressed as part of the development of the UNCRPD Implementation Plan. </p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past four months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 39,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 29,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation.</p>  <p>  Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.</p>  <p>  Providing accommodation and supports to displaced persons from Ukraine would not be possible without the whole of society response including the contributions from stakeholders, volunteers and the Irish public in general.  My Department is in regular contact with all the relevant stakeholders to facilitate the provision of supports and services to Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection to aid their integration and inclusion in the communities in which they are accommodated. This includes the Local Authorities who have stood up the Community Response Forum at local level which brings together organisations, statutory bodies such as Tusla and the HSE, and volunteers at a local level to link services to those that need them. It is within this forum that particular issues relating to needs of all beneficiaries of temporary protection to assist with inclusion in the community are raised and brought to the attention of state agencies and voluntary groups who can assist further.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has regular engagement with NGOs working in this sector. They have been extremely supportive and my Department is committed to continued cooperation and collaboration in assisting displaced persons fleeing conflict in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I have had the privilege in recent weeks to travel around the country to speak with representatives of community groups, family resource centres and youth services as well as those who are on the front line of this engagement. In particular, I thank the community groups around the country that have done so much, individually and collectively, to welcome those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine to our country.</p></reply>

Significant investment is being made by my Department to support parents with the costs of paying for early learning and childcare and to support providers with the costs of delivering early learning and childcare.</p><p>The major programmes funded by my Department that contribute to affordability for parents include the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).</p><p>The universal ECCE pre-school programme provides for free access to early learning and childcare for 15 hours per week for the two years before children start primary school.  This significantly offsets the costs to parents of early learning and childcare at this stage.</p><p>An estimated 95% children in the relevant age cohort participate in this programme.</p><p>The NCS provides financial support to help parents meet the cost of childcare and to support better outcomes for children.</p><p>There are two types of subsidies available under the NCS:</p><p>- From September a <b>Universal Subsidy</b>will be available to all families with children up to the age of 15.  Previously the Universal Subsidy was available for children up to age 3 only.  The extension will benefit up to 40,000 additional children.  This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.</p><p><b>- Income Assessed Subsidies</b>are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and varies depending on family income, the child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family. </p><p>Further information and resources for parents is available at www.ncs.gov.ie.</p><p>NCS is currently supporting thousands of families to offset their costs.  A recent review of the NCS showed that:</p><p>- 38% of families had more than half of their early learning and childcare costs covered by the NCS;</p><p>- 56% of families had more money to spend due to the scheme; and</p><p>- 28% of families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it. </p><p>I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability and accessibility. </p><p>An Expert Group to develop a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector examined the current model and made recommendations to Government in December which were accepted in full. This new funding model is now beginning to be implemented to improve quality, affordability, sustainability and accessibility of services.</p><p>The package of measures for the sector announced in Budget 2022 was informed by the Expert Group recommendations. The package includes a new Core Funding stream valued at up to &euro;221 million in a full year. Making early learning and childcare more affordable to parents and improving quality including through better terms and conditions for the workforce are key objectives of Core Funding, along with improving services' sustainability. </p><p>A central condition of Core Funding is that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time. </p><p>Budget 2022 extended universal NCS subsidies for children of all ages up to 15 and this will come into effect for the new programme year.  Budget 2022 also changed how &lsquo;wraparound hours&rsquo; for NCS subsidies are determined, essentially offering greater numbers of subsidised hours to families where not all parents are in work or study.  This change is already in effect. The Expert Group report also recommended increasing the NCS rates and this will also be implemented for future years.  </p><p>Ensuring no fee increase, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for parents.  </p><p>As outlined, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability and accessibility for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years which I plan to build on further.</p></reply>

This continued to be available until the end of April. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years and that providers have continued to be adequately supported.</p>  <p>  The investment in the sector through EWSS, on top of the various others Covid-related funding and other measures, tailored and adjusted to the needs at different stages of the pandemic, have significantly supported the sector. </p>  <p>  Looking to the longer terms plans for the sector, in December 2021, Government adopted the 25 recommendations contained in an Expert Group report, Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC).</p>  <p>  The new funding model will support the delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families. The new funding model will incorporate the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and introduce a new funding stream, Core Funding, from September. </p>  <p>  Core Funding is worth &euro;221 million in full year costs to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers. Core Funding allows for an estimated 19% increase in the total cost base for the sector.  </p>  <p>  Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. Core Funding will be allocated based largely on capacity. Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. </p>  <p>  Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision as well as graduate Managers, distributing public funding in respect of graduate staff more fairly across ELC provision.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of at least 9.5% in funding for ECCE services not led by a Graduate Lead Educator. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week is now available (compared to &euro;71.90 previously from ECCE standard capitation and PSP combined).</p>  <p>  Because Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this could mean a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. With average ECCE occupancy of 9 children per staff member, Core Funding is equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and less than 1% of services will see no change. No service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be in place. This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.  This will be open to both private and community providers.</p>  <p>  Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund is available to providers between May and August. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. I am delighted to report that so far 95% of services have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into contract for the Transition Fund. </p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, those who work in the sector, and society overall.   </p>  <p>  This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding and I look forward to working with these partner services.    </p>  <p>  I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.</p></reply>

This work will provide us with much needed insights into their experiences and valuable evidence about their outcomes.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that, on the information currently available, the Irish care system compares favourably with that in other similar countries. However, we do not understand enough of the individual circumstances of children, nor do we have enough evidence about the factors that support young adults achieve fulfilled lives. </p>  <p>  This project is a crucial step in gaining this knowledge and it will inform the development of effective and responsive policies in my Department and services, across government, that best serve the needs of children and young people in the care of the state.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the impetus for this project was Action 65 in the Ryan Report Implementation plan, which recommended that the HSE commence longitudinal research with young people leaving care over a ten year period. At various times over subsequent years consideration was given by my Department as to how best to address this recommendation and I am very pleased to advise the Deputy that the work on this project has commenced.</p>  <p>  The project will be carried out using a combination of primary research and strengthened administrative data collection and analysis. It will comprise cross sectional research on young adults who left care about ten years ago, a ten-year longitudinal study of young people transitioning from care in line with the Ryan Report recommendation, and other bespoke studies on children in care to complement improved system data. It will be led by my Department, with Tusla as a key partner.</p>  <p>  This project is a key priority of mine and I, and my officials, believe that developing this project in partnership with children in care, young adults in aftercare, their carers and others involved in service provision will be crucial to its success.</p>  <p>  A small project team has been established within my Department and towards the end of the summer that team will be joined by a member of staff from Tusla.</p>  <p>  The initial stage of project development is underway and work on a project plan has commenced, including consideration of governance structures and design, timelines and costings for each of the various elements of the project and a communications strategy. </p>  <p>  A key first step in the project plan will be to establish a steering group, with the involvement of key stakeholders, services providers, young people who have experience of the care system and other expert input.</p>  <p>  The first piece of work to be carried out will be the cross sectional research with young people who left the care system ten years ago. Planning for this piece of work is well underway and it will be tendered for via public procurement on eTenders in the coming days.</p>  <p>  At this point, it is difficult to provide a precise time frame for the project. However, given that  a longitudinal study on young people leaving care over a ten-year period is a key aspect of the  project, it is safe to assume that this project will be in progress over a period of ten years and more.</p></reply>

Under this Convention, the effective participation of, and consultation with, persons with disabilities, including children, in the development and implementation of policy and legislation is essential. </p>  <p>  I am committed to fulfilling Ireland's obligations in this regard by ensuring that policies and legislation are underpinned by robust and wide-ranging consultation with people with disabilities. In this regard, the approach represented by the phrase &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo; is a core principle of my Department's approach.</p>  <p>  There are currently a number of mechanisms and structures in place to provide for the involvement of people with disabilities, Disabled Persons Organisations (DPOs) and other representative organisations in the development and implementation of policy and legislation.  </p>  <p>  The Disability Participation and Consultation Network (DPCN) was established to support the fulfilment of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the UNCRPD. The DPCN aims to provide persons with a disability and Disabled Persons Organisations (DPOs) with the opportunity to be directly consulted and actively engaged in a meaningful and committed way in policy development. It is envisioned that, as it grows, the DPCN will provide the basis for effective and wide-ranging engagement with persons with a disability, their representative organisations, other disability organisations, and disability experts, including experts by experience.</p>  <p>  My Department also seeks to engage with people with disabilities through regular public consultations. Recent examples include the extensive consultation conducted with people with disabilities, DPOs, representative organisations, and families in developing Ireland&rsquo;s Initial State Report on the implementation of the UNCRPD, which was submitted to the UN Committee in November 2021. As part of this process, a specific consultation session was convened to ensure that the voice of children with disabilities was heard as part of the wider consultation process.</p>  <p>  Consultation is also at the centre of current efforts to develop a national Autism Innovation Strategy. A public consultation, including easy to read versions of documents, was launched to inform the development of the strategy in April 2022, followed by an expression of interest process to appoint an Oversight and Advisory Group to oversee implementation of the strategy. Particular importance is being placed on involving people with autism and members of the neurodiverse community. A further public consultation will be held prior to the finalisation of this strategy.</p>  <p>  In relation to implementation, my Department works closely with members of the Disability Stakeholder Group in monitoring implementation of our national disability strategies - the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy.

My officials have been working tirelessly to source accommodation in the context of the increasing accommodation pressures.</p>  <p>  Since the lifting of international travel restrictions post-COVID 19, there has been a significant increase of new arrivals seeking international protection (IP) in Ireland, with an average of 1,070 people per month making applications since January.  The pace of arrivals is unprecedented.</p>  <p>  This has coincided with the war in Ukraine, and in additional to those seeking IP, over 39,000 refugees have come to Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive, with almost 27,000 of those now accommodated by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  </p>  <p>  In the immediate term, it has been necessary to create a temporary resting area in Citywest. The temporary resting area consists of a seating area and dormitory style accommodation with beds and showering facilities. Applicants move from the facility as soon as alternative accommodation is available for them. </p>  <p>  IPAS is contracting additional accommodation weekly for international protection applicants.  It has sought expressions of interest from contractors interested in providing accommodation for international protection applicants over the next six months.  It has also moved Ukrainian beneficiaries of temporary protection from all international protection hotels so to create as much accommodation as possible for international protection applicants. However, IPAS is continuing to experience acute accommodation shortage. It is expected that this will continue over the summer during the tourist high season.  </p>  <p>  In the medium term, the request for tender (RFT), published on 18 January 2022, seeks to procure additional accommodation for singles, couples and families seeking international protection. </p>  <p>  This tender process is a key plank in my Department&rsquo;s strategy to end reliance on emergency accommodation and will assist in alleviating the accommodation pressures currently being experienced. The RFT encourages tenders from not-for-profit organisations and promotes tenderers to work with not-for-profit organisations in the delivery of related services. </p>  <p>  A higher than expected number of submissions were received by the deadline of 21 February 2022. The compliance check process commenced on 28 February but was subsequently delayed due to the Ukrainian refugee situation. The compliance check has now recommenced and the tenders are currently being evaluated, with the aim of bringing successful tenders on stream as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In addition, an advertisement will issue from IPAS shortly seeking offers from providers nationwide to accommodate international protection applicants on an emergency basis.  The aim is to increase potential accommodation capacity for international protection applicants.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s first National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022, published in November 2019, is the primary policy vehicle to achieve this vision.</p>  <p>  The Strategy pursues objectives under four thematic pillars providing a vision of an Ireland where LGBTI+ people are visible and included, treated equally, healthy and feel safe and supported.  It includes over 100 actions aimed at making progress towards these high-level objectives.</p>  <p>  To offset delays in the strategy's implementation due to the public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I extended its lifetime into 2022. Work is continuing this year on the implementation of the strategy. The strategy will be reviewed next year as part of the process of developing a successor.</p>  <p>  In relation to specific actions to keep the community safe; action 21 of the strategy aims to ensure that Ireland has robust legislation and supports in place to combat hate crime, and encourages people to report it. The Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na lead on this action, and have introduced several measures to protect LGBTI+ people including changes to the recording of motives on the Garda PULSE system and the implementation of an online hate crime reporting tool.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Department of Justice will publish the Hate Crime Bill in the coming months. The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. The protected characteristics identified in the General Scheme are race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origin, sexual orientation, gender, and disability.  The Employment Equality Acts also provide protection against harassment in the workplace, including against members of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department recently commissioned research aimed at capturing the views and experiences of people who have been subjected to the practice of conversion therapy in Ireland. This qualitative research which commenced in February 2022 is expected to be completed in Autumn 2022, and will assist the Government in developing legislation to ban the practice of conversion therapy. My Department will also examine international good practice in this regard.</p></reply>

A final Annual Report for 2020 was published on 20 January 2022, along with updates to the policy framework indicator set.</p>  <p>  Recently, my Department concluded a public consultation on the policy framework which invited children and young people, parents, professionals working in this sector and others to have their say on what is going well and not well for children and young people, as well as identify priorities for the new framework. This is part of an on-going consultative process for the framework, to ensure it reflects the priorities of children and young people and all those who support them, and building on the extensive consultations carried out by my Department in recent years.  </p>  <p>  I recently approved the approach to the new policy framework, which is intended to inform cross government work for children and young people over the period 2023-2028.  The framework aims to place children and young people at the centre of policy, while also addressing the most pressing issues for children and young people now and over the lifetime of the framework. </p>  <p>  The new policy framework will take a rights based approach, aligned to the UNCRC in its principles and implementation measures. To allow time for the hearing before the UNCRC Committee which is now expected to take place in Q1 2023, I have approved the extension of the publication date to Q1 2023, which will allow any final gaps to be identified and provide a further confirmation on the approach. </p></reply>

Overall, the proportion of places for babies and toddlers is higher in more urbanised counties, while demand for these places is very high.  </p>  <p>  As you are no doubt aware, the availability of high-quality early learning and childcare that is affordable and accessible is a key Government priority. </p>  <p>  Since 2015, significant increases in State investment in early learning and childcare has given rise to a substantial growth in the numbers of children participating in these services. More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. The new core-funding model, currently being rolled out at present, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.</p>  <p>  Last year I announced the National Action Plan for Childminding that sets out steps towards regulation, support and subsidies, for all paid, non-relative childminders. This plan will also support the engagement with many additional childminders that offer flexible, homebased care for children in their local communities.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, the Childcare Committees, will proactively engage with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.</p></reply>

The Plan was subsequently submitted to the European Commission and published on both www.gov.ie and ec.europa.eu.</p>  <p>  The National Action Plan sets out the responses to barriers identified by Departments, and informed by consultations with stakeholders, in the provision of services to children referred to in the EU Child Guarantee Recommendation.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the European Commission announced the creation of an EU Child Guarantee with a view to ensuring that every child in Europe at risk of poverty or social exclusion has access to the most basic of rights like healthcare and education. The objective of the Child Guarantee is to prevent and combat social exclusion by guaranteeing the access of children in need to a set of key services.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan details efforts, in accordance with the aims of the Guarantee, to address child poverty and social exclusion in Ireland and, in so doing, highlights key strategies currently in play. The key areas of the Plan refer to actions, objectives, targets and timelines - addressing some of the key barriers identified &ndash; in each of the sectors of Education, Early Years, Health, Nutrition and Housing.  The successor framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Framework for Children and Young People, will provide an enabling policy framework for the Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The publication of the National Action Plan was an important first step in the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee. My Department is coordinating actions across Government in addition to holding responsibility for the delivery of actions contained in this Plan relating to Early Childhood Education and Care. The delivery of other key actions in the plan will be a matter for the parent Department holding policy and operational responsibility. In this regard, the Departments of Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Education and Health are critical stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Identifying the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people is a particular focus of work. In this regard, the new National Framework for Children and Young People, currently under development, and its cross-government and cross-sectoral engagement will inform the implementation of the Child Guarantee National Action Plan.  I have recently approved an extension for the publication of that framework to Q1 2023. This will allow time for the hearing before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (scheduled for early next year) and any emergent learning to inform, in a comprehensive manner, the development and finalisation process of the new Framework.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 39,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 29,000 have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  My Department has contracted approximately 22,500 beds currently in hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;Bs, hostels, self-catering accommodation and certain other repurposed settings with additional capacity also being pursued through accommodation pledged by the general public, state-owned or private properties which may be suitable for short-term accommodation, accommodation belonging to voluntary bodies, student accommodation, holiday homes, religious order properties and Local Authority facilities. </p>  <p>  Within my Department, a dedicated Ukraine Response Division has been established. A total of 130 staff from internal and external sources have been assigned to support the department&rsquo;s response.  A large number of these staff have transferred from within the Department with consequent impacts on ongoing work priorities. The Division also includes newly recruited staff who speak Ukrainian and/or Russian, and those seconded from other Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. Numbers seeking international protection have also increased significantly, adding to accommodation capacity issues.</p>  <p>  I want to recognise the hard work and commitment of Department staff in working to provide accommodation for so many people in such a short period, as well as maintaining work progress in other key areas. Many staff across my Department have volunteered their own time, at night and on weekends, to work in the transit hub in Citywest to provide that immediate welcome to people fleeing Ukraine as they arrive here. The Department and its staff will continue in their efforts to assist those arriving as best they can. </p></reply>

The Government has been strongly supportive of the sector, particularly since the onset of Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The Transition Fund is in place to support providers between May and August 2022.  The Transition Fund is designed to support the financial stability of services in the period between the end of Covid-19 supports under the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and ahead of the introduction of the new Core Funding Scheme in September 2022. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that approximately 95% of providers have now signed up to the Transition Fund.</p>  <p>  The Transition Fund makes a contribution of 7% of each service's calculated income capacity in respect of the weeks that the service is open.  This is a significant contribution to services' sustainability. On average, approximately 70% of providers' costs are made up of staff costs and approximately 30% of costs are made up of non-staff costs.    </p>  <p>  One measure of financial stability of the sector is the number of services that open and close.  Current data on service closures and openings are not markedly different to the trend in previous years. Moreover, the data on service closures identify the wide range of reasons for these closures as reported by providers themselves, including retirement of owners or other personal circumstances. Only a minority are reported to be related to financial stability. </p>  <p>  These data indicate that the Covid-19 supports and the Transition Fund have proven successful in providing financial stability to the sector.</p>  <p>  The main contractual requirement for the Transition Fund is that fees remain at or below September 2021 levels for the duration of the scheme. This has provided important financial stability to parents.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged that providers have shown such willingness to work in partnership with the State towards the shared goal of delivering affordable early learning and childcare for families.</p>  <p>  The high uptake of the Transition Fund bodes well for the introduction of Core Funding in September.  This is further underscored by the fact that 89% of providers have now completed a survey which is the first step to coming into contract for Core Funding.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. Core Funding is open to all eligible providers subject to their agreement to the recently-published Funding Agreement. Becoming a Core Funding Partner Service is, of course, optional but I look forward to a very high proportion of providers becoming Partner Services.</p>  <p>  As you can see, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years.</p></reply>

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality early learning and care. AIM offers tailored, practical supports based on need and does not require a formal diagnosis of disability.</p>  <p>  There are seven levels of AIM, which encompass a range of both universal and targeted supports for pre-school settings. Universal supports are designed to create a more inclusive culture in early learning and care settings, through training courses and qualifications for staff. Where universal supports are not enough to meet the needs of an individual child, targeted supports are available to ensure the child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  From September 2022 I will make additional funding available to support children with disabilities to access the State-funded Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Additional capitation will be provided to increase AIM Level 7 supports to providers from &euro;210 per week to &euro;240 per week. This funding is used by the pre-school provider either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance.</p>  <p>  One of the commitments in First 5, A Government Strategy for Babies and Children, was to undertake an end of Three-Year Evaluation of AIM. That evaluation has been undertaken and the draft report has been reviewed by the Cross Sectoral Implementation Group (CSIG), with the final report due to be published in Q3 of this year. </p>  <p>  The evaluation included extensive consultations with parents, providers and other key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  Subject to evaluation findings and other relevant developments, we will be considering potential enhancements to, and/or extensions of AIM.</p></reply>

In particular, it will take on board the criticism of the range of low-level commitments in the previous framework, the need for streamlined implementation structures, and responding to emerging priorities or priorities where there are worsening challenges for children and young people, such as recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health and well-being. </p></reply>

As this issue is primarily an operational matter for Tusla, I have sought and received an input from them on this matter.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that when a child in care requires a passport, Tusla follows a clear process to ensure that the correct consent is in place and that the passport application is made in a timely manner. Depending on the complexity of the case this process can take additional time. The legal status of the child in care determines the approach taken by the social worker.</p>  <p>  If a child is under a full care order under the 1991 Child Care Act, Tusla has the legal authority to provide consent for the application and makes the application for a passport on behalf of the child. </p>  <p>  I have been further informed that for children in voluntary care or under an interim care order, consent for an application must be given by their legal guardian. Securing this consent can at times create a delay.  If consent for an application is not given, Tusla must seek a direction from the courts under Section 47 of the Child Care Act 1991. Depending on the case, this process can take up to an additional 4 weeks. </p>  <p>  For children who are born outside of Ireland, the process can also be delayed in seeking paperwork from their birth country. </p>  <p>  Tusla would advise that foster carers provide sufficient notice to the social work department of any requests for Tusla to submit a passport application for a child in care. Once submitted to the relevant office or passport office, the application process is beyond the control of Tusla.</p>  <p>  Tusla are in the process of developing a Strategic Plan on Foster Care 2022-2025. Further, I am aware that Tusla has recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of the Plan. </p>  <p>  Tusla has informed me that their ambition for this Plan is to ensure that they implement the recommendations, to promote a partnership approach with foster carers and to ensure consistency in service provision. As part of their Plan currently in development, Tusla will review all current standard business processes including the process relating to passport applications. </p></reply>

An 'unaccompanied minor' refers to third-country nationals or stateless persons below the age of eighteen, who arrive on the territory of the Member States unaccompanied by an adult responsible for them.  </p>  <p>  A 'separated child' is someone under 18 years of age who is outside their country of origin and separated from both parents or their previous legal / customary primary caregiver, but may arrive with other relatives or known (non-related) adults, including when those relatives or known adults have been provided with authorisation to travel with or care for the child. </p>  <p>  In 2022, to date, 380 unaccompanied minors have been referred to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. </p>  <p>  Since the commencement of the war on Ukraine on 25th February, 175 unaccompanied minors from Ukraine have been referred to Tusla. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, Tusla makes every attempt to contact relatives of the child and to reunite the child with family members or friends. If children cannot be reunified with family or friends, they are either  received into the State care, or, if older and in line with their needs, are fully supported by Tusla in having an appropriate placement, education and other assistance. </p>  <p>  There are currently 64 unaccompanied minors from Ukraine in Tusla's care, and 105 children from all other countries. </p>  <p>  Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, including children arriving from the Ukraine, are supported and accommodated by Tusla, in accordance with the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has a specialist social work team for unaccompanied minors seeking asylum and separated children, which is referred to as the Separated Children Seeking International Protection Team (SCSIP). Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for unaccompanied minors seeking asylum who arrive unannounced at Irish ports, including airports.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has a significant role, as part of the State&rsquo;s overall response, to support individuals, particularly women and children, displaced from Ukraine, as a result of the war and coming into Ireland. Tusla is committed to balancing the needs of families in a humanitarian crisis, with its child protection responsibilities, and requirement to support families and promote the welfare of children.</p>  <p>  On arrival, separated children from Ukraine are referred to the Tusla specialist social work team for a screening assessment, to confirm their care arrangements. A review of documentation is undertaken to establish if parental consent or other relevant information is available. Where no immediate child protection or welfare concern is identified, the separated child and accompanying adults may travel to their intended destination. A local Tusla social work office will follow up and visit the child and include translator services as required. </p>  <p>  Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, who arrive at ports of entry to Ireland, are referred to Tusla for a child protection needs assessment. These children are placed by Tusla either in small specialist residential care centres, or with specifically recruited foster carers under the F&aacute;ilte Care project.  Social Workers and social care workers are allocated to support and monitor the progress of the child or young person. The care plan may involve specialist English language tuition, intensive educational supports and therapeutic work in respect of trauma.</p>  <p>  Children who arrive in Ireland outside of a dedicated refugee programme are supported in their application for refugee status.</p>  <p>  Assisting children with reunification with their families has evolved as a key piece of the support social workers provide to those who are eligible to apply for refugee status.  Where relevant, the process of reunification is started as soon as the children come to the attention of Tusla.    </p></reply>

The WRC&rsquo;s primary functions include the inspection of employment law compliance, the provision of information on employment law, mediation, adjudication, conciliation, facilitation, and advisory services. WRC inspectors carry out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislation.</p>  <p>  The yearly cost of recruiting an executive officer inspector for the Workplace Relations Commission would be approximately &euro;62,855 PPC. This is based on the calculation of staff costs as set out in the Public Spending Code. The code sets out that the cost should be based on the midpoint of the salary scale and include employer&rsquo;s salary related PRSI, imputed pension costs and overheads e.g. ICT equipment, legal costs, travel and subsistence. WRC inspectors also qualify for an allowance of &euro;8,779, bringing the cost of recruiting one inspector to approximately &euro;71,634 per annum.</p>  <p>  Using the same methodology, the cost of ten additional inspectors would be approximately &euro;716,340.</p>  <p>  My Department fully supports and continues to work closely with the WRC in monitoring its staffing and budgetary requirements. This includes anticipating future resource requirements to ensure that it is supported and adequately resourced to carry out its important work.</p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan 2021 recognises the important role of electricity storage, in supporting the transformation of the electricity sector. Under Climate Action Plan 2021, my Department has committed to developing a national electricity storage policy framework, which is due for publication in Q1 2023. To help inform this work, my Department will launch a public consultation in summer 2022. In addition, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has committed to reviewing the regulatory treatment of storage in late 2023.</p>  <p>  At present, Turlough Hill is the only large scale pumped storage power station in Ireland with an installed capacity of 292MW. However, Ireland has also supported the inclusion of the Silvermines Hydroelectric Pumped Storage facility on the EU&rsquo;s Project of Common Interest List. The proposed development will provide 1.8GWh of storage with 360MW export capacity and 360MW of pumping load. Projects of Common Interest are key cross border infrastructure projects that link the energy systems of EU countries but can also include storage projects such as Silvermines. The project is on the 5th PCI list which was published last November. </p></reply>

This review is focussed on the on the period to 2030 and will examine the risks to security of supply and a range of potential mitigating options. The review includes a technical analysis which will help inform a public consultation. The technical analysis includes identification and examination of the key risks to the security of supply in the electricity and natural gas systems; identification of options that could address or mitigate these risks in the period to 2030; and appraisal of these options in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050. The underlying technical analysis is being updated to take into account the war in Ukraine. I expect the public consultation on the review to commence shortly, at which point all parties can submit their views for consideration.  </p>  <p>  The Policy Statement on importing fracked gas was approved by Government and published in May 2021. The policy statement provides that, pending the outcome of this review, it would not be appropriate for the development of any LNG terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with.  </p></reply>

Institutions often use official documents, like passports or driving licences in order to verify a customer&rsquo;s identity. However neither the relevant legislation (Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended, nor the Central Bank of Ireland are prescriptive as to what documents and information can be relied upon. </p>  <p>  Accordingly firms have some flexibility in this regard, including in situations where an asylum seeker or refugee may be unable to provide traditional forms of identity documentation.</p>  <p>  While providing asylum seekers or refugees with access to financial products and services can create challenges for institutions where the identity of such persons cannot be verified on the basis of &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; forms of identification like passports or driving licences, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has previously issued Guidance on this point which provides that official identity documents issued by an EU Member State to asylum seekers/refugees which confirms their status and right to reside in that EU Member State are likely to satisfy the verification requirement.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Payment Accounts Directive provides that credit institutions cannot refuse the opening of payment account unless the opening of the account or its subsequent use would result in a breach of national law transposing the applicable Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/ Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Directive, for example, because the credit institution cannot manage the Money Laundering (ML)/ Terrorism- Financing (TF) risk associated with the business relationship. </p>  <p>  The EBA&rsquo;s Guidance provides that a situation where an asylum seeker can only provide less robust evidence of identity, is unlikely to be sufficient AML/CFT grounds to refuse the opening of an account, given that it is likely that the firm could manage the ML/TF risks presented by such a prospective customer by ensuring that only a basic payment account is offered, for example with no overdraft facility and with monthly turnover/transfer limits.</p>  <p>  In 2021 the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), in conjunction with a number of retail Banks, issued guidance to assist asylum seekers and refugees on opening a bank account in Ireland, which included information on the type of non-standard documentation, including state issued documents, that will be accepted as forms of identification when opening an account. This information can be found here - bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Final-BPFI-Guide-to-Opening-Bank-Accounts-in-Ireland-for-Protection-Applicants-Final.pdf.</p>  <p>  In addition to this the BPFI via the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have provided information booklets on opening a bank account in Ireland to Ukrainians at entry points into the country, the booklet is available in both Ukrainian and Russian languages. </p>  <p>  Full lists of accepted proof of identity and address documents and information on how to open a bank account for Ukrainian citizens coming to Ireland can be found on each of the retail banks websites. Anyone who is unsure of how to meet the identification requirements should inquire with the bank of their choice on what would be acceptable as proof of residence. </p></reply>

The Group A threshold (currently &euro;335,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) of the disponer.  </p>  <p>  A foster child is treated as a child of the disponer and can avail of the Group A threshold in the following circumstances:</p>  <p>  - in respect of a gift or an inheritance from a foster parent with whom he or she has lived, and who has cared for and maintained the child at his or her own expense, for a cumulative period of at least 5 years before the child&rsquo;s 18th birthday, or</p>  <p>  -  in respect of an inheritance from a foster parent where, prior to the inheritance, the child had been placed in the care of the foster parent under the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995, or the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the current position is that certain children in either informal long-term foster care arrangements or formal foster care arrangements can avail of the Group A tax-free threshold on inheritances from a foster parent. Where a foster child who is the subject of an informal long-term arrangement avails of the Group A threshold, there is a requirement that a minimum of two witnesses can attest to the bona fides of the arrangement.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that a person can bequeath their principal private residence, generally the most substantial asset held by an individual, free from tax under the dwelling house exemption which allows for property to be inherited tax free where the inheritor is already living in the home, irrespective of the person&rsquo;s relationship to the inheritor, subject to certain conditions.</p>  <p>  Information is also available on the Revenue website at the link www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-inheritance/cat-reliefs/foster-child-relief/index.aspx.</p></reply>

These projections take into account the budgetary measures in place in each year.</p>  <p>  The costing of specific expenditure measures is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. While my Department does not estimate the second-round effects of budgetary measures in the form of increased taxation receipts on a measure-by-measure basis, additional revenues returned to the Exchequer are approximated via a top-down process. </p>  <p>  Specifically, the aggregate Budget package, including inter alia changes in social welfare payments and other expenditures, are incorporated into the macroeconomic forecasts produced by my Department. These macroeconomic projections drive the forecasts of taxation revenue. </p>  <p>  For example, if the total Budget package were to result in an increase in consumption for next year in the macroeconomic projections this would, all else equal, drive an increase in VAT receipts in the fiscal projections.</p></reply>

Improving member services</p><p>2.  Supporting investment in collaboration</p><p>3.  Supporting Governance</p><p>4.  Recognition of the role of credit unions</p><p>5.  Transparency of regulatory engagement </p><p>Cumulatively, the desired outcome of these objectives is to strengthen the role of credit unions as a provider of community banking and to further enable credit unions to focus on priorities that will better position the sector to face the challenges and opportunities of the future. </p><p>In developing these proposals Minister Fleming has met the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers Association, the National Supervisors Forum, the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the CEO Forum, collaborative ventures and many individual credit unions.</p><p>In total as part of the Review process Minister Fleming has held over fifty stakeholder meetings with the credit union sector and considered well over one hundred proposals.</p><p>We will go to Cabinet shortly to seek approval to draft a Bill to implement the proposals.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-07a.493.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070700075#WRN01600"><p>There is a broad legal and regulatory framework in place which governs the provision of mortgages to consumers.  Specifically in relation to the requirement for life assurance for the purposes of a mortgage (otherwise known as mortgage protection insurance), section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 provides that mortgage lenders shall ensure that a mortgage applicant has a life assurance policy in place before granting a mortgage loan.  This is an important statutory provision which is designed to protect the borrower's dependants and their home should the borrower die before the mortgage has been repaid.  However, the Act also recognises that in certain cases such protection is not necessary or would not be appropriate and it provides for a number of limited exemptions to this statutory obligation.  These exceptions are:</p>  <p>  -  where the house in respect of which the loan is made is, in the mortgage lender's opinion, not intended for use as the principal residence of the borrower or of his/her dependants;</p>  <p>  -  loans to persons who belong to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to an insurer, or which would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally;</p>  <p>  -  loans to persons who are over 50 years of age at the time the loan is approved;</p>  <p>  -  loans to persons who, at the time the loan is made, have otherwise arranged life assurance, providing for payment of a sum, in the event of death, that will at least cover the outstanding balance on the mortgage.</p>  <p>  However, it should also be noted that, as a contractual matter outside of the above statutory framework, mortgage lenders could still require that a life assurance policy is put in place as a condition for a mortgage.  In such circumstances that would be a business and commercial matter for the individual lender. </p>  <p>  In relation to the operation of the life assurance market more generally, the Central Bank expects the assurance industry to engage with its customers in an open, fair and transparent manner.  However, it is important to note that, subject to compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements governing the provision of life assurance, that insurance underwriting decisions and the medical and other evidence required to assist such decision making are a commercial and business matter for the life assurance provider having regard to their own risk analysis.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, if an applicant for a mortgage and/or life assurance is not satisfied with the way a regulated firm is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. </p>  <p>  If an applicant for a mortgage/life assurance is not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity to that complaint, the person may then submit the matter to the statutory and independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Special leave with pay for COVID-19 arrangements were introduced in March 2020 as a temporary measure in response to the unprecedented circumstances presented by the COVID pandemic. Special Leave with Pay has been used in lieu of sick leave across the Public Service to assist in the prevention of the possible onward spread of COVID-19 in the work premises. From 1 July 2022, Special Leave with Pay for COVID-19 continues to be available for the stated self-isolation period, which is currently 7 days. Following this, if a Public Service employee remains unwell, they may avail of the provisions of the Public Service sick leave scheme, which is a form of paid leave for the public service.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health submitted a proposal to my Department for a temporary, ring-fenced arrangement for certain employees unfit for work post COVID-19 infection. It is based on the Blood Borne Diseases Circular that is unique to the Health sector. My Department have approved the proposal and I understand that the Department of Health are engaging with health sector representative bodies on the scheme. </p></reply>

The Government's approach to commemorations continues to be underpinned by the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations (EAG) and consultation with the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations. </p>  <p>  One of the strengths of the programme is the spirit of collaboration and partnership with a rich diversity of stakeholders &ndash; including State partners, local authorities, national cultural institutions, institutions of learning, and artists. The Department&rsquo;s role is to provide support and assistance when required, but many of the programme initiatives are led, organised and curated by individual partners. </p>  <p>  For example, under the Community Strand of the Decade of Centenaries Programme, my Department provides funding and support to every local authority to support the curation of community-led commemorative programming. Decisions regarding the inclusion of initiatives within a local authority&rsquo;s Decade of Centenaries programme are a matter for the individual local authorities. It is important to stress that each local authority is best placed to determine what&rsquo;s appropriate for their local area, in light of local history and expertise, and to make decisions concerning initiatives to be supported from their funding allocation.</p>  <p>  In line with the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group, it is envisaged that one significant State commemoration will be held later this year in remembrance of all those who lost their lives in the Civil War period, focussing on the themes of remembrance and reconciliation. It is not the intention of the State to mark individual events.  The Group also recommends that initiatives which will serve as &lsquo;living legacies&rsquo; for the Decade of Centenaries would be particularly beneficial, such as those that highlight the importance of original research and scholarship at national and local level, and promote free, public access to authentic historical sources.</p>  <p>  In this context, I would like to highlight the National Library of Ireland&rsquo;s commemorative activities - the NLI has continued its programme of digitising and sharing tens of thousands of documents as part of its contribution to the Decade of Centenaries, including papers of Arthur Griffith.  The material is freely accessible online at www.nli.ie/en/online-catalogue.aspx.   </p></reply>

Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates these commitments. </p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings have taken place to advance elements of the work.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.

Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2.  Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>-  Identification and description of defect,</p><p>-  Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>-  Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>-  Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>-  Period of construction affected,</p><p>-  Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>-  Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>1.  Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>2.  Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>-In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>1.  Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>-  Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>-  Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>-  individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>-  routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>-  Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>1.  Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>2.  Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>3.  Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>The working group is currently concluding its deliberations in support of the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and working towards finalisation of its report.

A study is currently underway to establish the facts of the situation and make recommendations for how the problem can be remedied.

The constitutional provisions require that D&aacute;il constituencies be revised whenever population change, as ascertained in a census, leads to population to member ratios in individual constituencies that are significantly out of line with the national average or the limits set out in the Constitution of 1 member to every 20,000 to 30,000 of population. It is only following the publication of final census results that the constituency revision can be completed.</p>  <p>  As set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 271 of 28 June 2022, the Electoral Reform Bill 2022, which is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides for, among other matters, the establishment of an Electoral Commission.  In addition, the Bill provides for the review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies to be undertaken by the new Electoral Commission following its establishment.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the Electoral Commission is required to publish the report on its review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies within three months of the publication of the final census results. This mirrors the timeline that currently applies to the D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituency review process.</p>  <p>  While the publication of final census results is a matter for the Central Statistics Office, results are anticipated for publication in Spring 2023 with the publication of the Commission's report anticipated in Summer 2023.  It will then be a matter for the Government to bring forward a Bill and for the Oireachtas to legislate in this important matter. Any general election held before new constituencies are enacted will be held on the constituencies set out in the Electoral (Amendment) (D&aacute;il Constituencies) Act 2017.</p></reply>

There is no change in policy in relation to public ownership. Nor is there a change in the legal position as set out in section 2 of the Water Services Act 2014 which prevents a current or future Government from initiating any legislative proposals that would seek to transfer Irish Water from public ownership, unless such proposals are first approved by a majority vote of the Irish people in a national plebiscite.</p>  <p>  The matter of a referendum on water ownership continues to be under active consideration as a broader policy concern relevant to the water sector transformation process in line with the Government Policy Paper.</p></reply>

The information available on the Tracker has recently been upgraded and is an excellent guide as to where an application is in the system.</p><p>The online Passport Tracker tool provides applicants with an indication of how their application is progressing through the system and gives an estimated issue date based on the current average application processing time. The tracker is updated every two hours between 7am and 7pm.</p><p>When tracking their application using the online tracker tool, applicants will receive updates that relate to the current status of their application, such as:</p><p>- Application has been received.</p><p>- Application has been received. Applicant must submit supporting documents to proceed with the application.</p><p>- Supporting documents have been received and are being verified.</p><p>- Application is being processed</p><p>- There is a problem with the application. An email has been sent to the applicant.</p><p>- Passport is being printed.</p><p>- Passport has been dispatched.</p><p>The &ldquo;processing application&rdquo; stage on the Tracker covers the period of time from when supporting documents have been received and verified by the Passport Service until the application is approved. During some of that period the application is in a queue waiting to be reviewed.</p><p>On a recent occasion, during the week of 13 June 2022, the Passport Service experienced technical issues with the Tracker, resulting in the registration of some online applications being delayed. These issues were identified as soon as possible and the affected applications have now been updated on the Tracker. The Tracker is now operating as normal. </p><p>The Passport Service operates an award-winning online service, which compares favourably with countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom.  The recent service improvements implemented by the Passport Service are enhancing the efficient and effective delivery of this essential citizen service. While there are no current plans to update the online Passport Tracker, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways to enhance further the customer experience for citizens, in particular through its ongoing programme of reform.</p></reply>

Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools. </p><p>Where capacity issues arise it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place  to a number of schools in the area</p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school there are not available to all pupils</p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p><p>The post-primary School Planning Area referred to by the Deputy is served by 7 post-primary school for which 3 of these current have building projects with the Department as follows:</p><p>- Mount Temple Comprehensive School &ndash; Major Project for an extension to expand school to 1,000 pupils. This project is currently at stage 2b to provide a new school building</p><p>- St. Paul&rsquo;s College Raheny &ndash; Additional School Accommodation application at stage 1 for a 2-classroom SEN class, 2 Construction rooms ,1 Music room and Home-Economics room</p><p>- Ardscoil De La Salle College Raheny &ndash; Additional Accommodation application at stage 1 for a 2-classroom SEN class plus 1 music room.</p><p>The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review and work on an updated exercise to assess needs for the coming years, including those which may arise in the Killester Raheny Clontarf and adjacent areas is ongoing.

Of the first year pupils entering post-primary schools in the school planning area in 2020, over 32% of the pupils came from primary schools located outside the school planning area, while some 40% of 6th class students of primary schools within the school planning area started 1st year in schools outside the school planning area. Such patterns of transfer are not uncommon in urban areas where there is a high degree of proximity and permeability between school planning areas. </p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have recently received two reports of the programme from UCD: </p>  <p>  - A Report of review on the SNA programme, conducted by the Teaching and Learning Committee within UCD School of Education and </p>  <p>  - An evaluation report based on data gathered from the first cohort of students to complete the programme</p>  <p>  The reports are under review at present and will inform our consideration on accreditation.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the Programme for Government, which states that this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education across all schools.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (the NCCA) was requested to conduct a review of RSE provision in Irish schools, focusing on a range of topics including healthy, positive sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQ+ matters. The NCCA published &ldquo;The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools&rdquo; in December, 2019.</p>  <p>  This report resulted in the NCCA establishing two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work of developing an updated curriculum in this area and supporting the development of guidance material for schools.</p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the work of the NCCA has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE and RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE and RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. This work is progressing well and already teachers will find much support there, including a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE Junior Cycle Short Course and the Senior Cycle SPHE Framework.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum is underway. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  </p>  <p>  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification has recently been approved by NCCA Council, with a public consultation to follow, running from July to October. It is expected that the finalised specification will be presented to Council for approval by the end of this year, and will be implemented in schools in September 2023.</p>  <p>  Work in preparing a background paper that will inform the updating of senior cycle SPHE/RSE is underway. It is intended that the curriculum redevelopment work will commence in September 2022 and a draft updated specification for senior cycle SPHE will be ready for public consultation by summer 2023 and finalised in early 2024 for implementation in schools in September 2024.</p>  <p>  Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, the NCCA will establish a development group which is due to commence development on updated primary specifications in Quarter 4 2022, with a draft estimated to be available for public consultation in Quarter 1 2024.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. </p>  <p>  The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.   </p>  <p>  When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.   </p>  <p>  Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p>  <p>  A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p>  <p>  A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. </p>  <p>  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools</p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32million to the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to a total of in the region of &euro;180million. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. This model uses information from my Department's enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>  The extension of the DEIS programme to additional schools follows intensive work by the DEIS technical group, which involved valuable input from stakeholders. The refined DEIS identification model builds on the objectivity and fairness of the 2017 version, but now captures a greater breadth of disadvantage and accounts for severity of disadvantage through the application of a weighted process. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and of students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. The DEIS programme focuses on targeting additional resources at those schools with the highest concentrations of students who are at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which they have been identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme. Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.</p>  <p>  All appeals submitted have now been processed by my Department and schools have been notified of the outcome.</p>  <p>  The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners.</p>  <p>The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found at: www.gov.ie/en/circular/7e7ca-deis-identification-2022-appeals-process-for-schools/</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my Department&rsquo;s vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, my Department recognises that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders and will consider information provided by schools in correspondence following the application of the refined DEIS identification model.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index when available can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-07a.639.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022070700078#WRQ03400"><p>The Government acknowledges the crucial role that family carers play and is fully committed to supporting carers in that role. This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p><p>My Department provides a comprehensive package of income supports for carers including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.</p><p>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means-tested social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people whose needs are such that they require full-time care and attention.  The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2022 is approximately &euro;990 million.</p><p>There are a number of basic principles which underpin the social welfare system, one of which is the general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.  Generally, people qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment for which they are eligible.</p><p>There are a limited number of exceptions to the general principle of one person, one payment. In 2007, a new Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was introduced for certain people with another social welfare entitlement. This had been a particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they became carers.  The issue was highlighted by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs in its Report on the Positions of Full-time Carers (2003).  In order to address these concerns, reforms in this area were provided for in Budget 2007.  Under the new arrangements, people in receipt of certain social welfare payments other than Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit who are providing full-time care and attention can retain their main payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which is equivalent to a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  Therefore, a person who may have an underlying entitlement to another social welfare payment - such as the State Pension - can transfer to that payment and continue to receive up to a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  These arrangements apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments and to people in receipt of an increase for a qualified adult. Recipients of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit are not eligible given the jobseeking nature of these payments.</p><p>In addition, the annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to family carers providing full-time care and assistance regardless of means.  This is not available for any other group. Despite the extra financial demands due to the Covid-19 crisis, in Budget 2021, I increased the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant by &euro;150 to its current rate of &euro;1,850.  This is the highest rate since its introduction.  The estimated spend on this grant in 2022 is over &euro;262 million.</p><p>In acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society, I introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department for carers.  These include the following changes to the Carer's Allowance means test which took effect last month:</p><p>-  An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p><p>-  An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 a week for single carers and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p><p>In addition, I announced the following changes also benefitting carers which came into effect in January:</p><p>-  &euro;5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments, including carers.</p><p>-  &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over and &euro;2 for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payments.</p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance is now paid for children who go into hospital for up to 6 months (formerly 3 months).  The payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance where applicable, also continues to be paid in respect of children who go into hospital for 6 months.  </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers by this Department under review and will ensure that consultations with carers' representative groups continue so that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met.  However, to pay full-rate Carer's Allowance along with another social welfare payment, as proposed, would involve significant additional expenditure and could only be considered in an overall Budgetary context. </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;203 million in 2022.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. </p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  Therefore, to receive the fuel allowance a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department and also have satisfied a means test.</p>  <p>  Any decision to remove the means test qualifying criteria for fuel allowance for those who are in receipt of the State Pension Contributory would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall welfare budget package of &euro;600m in increases I secured for 2022, I was pleased to be able to increase the Fuel Allowance payment by &euro;5 per week effective from Budget night and to increase the weekly income threshold for Fuel Allowance by &euro;20.  In addition, further lump sum payments of &euro;125 and &euro;100 were made in March and May of this year respectively to Fuel Allowance recipients.  These measures are better targeted at those most at risk of fuel poverty. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme, a heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs.  If a recipient of a social protection or HSE payment has exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, that person may apply for a heating supplement.  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  Heating supplements are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p>  <p>  Under the SWA scheme, Additional Needs Payments may also be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost, which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Detailed information on claims awarded, claims rejected, claims withdrawn and total claims registered are available in the Annual Statistics report at www.gov.ie/dsp/statistics.</p><p>Claims awarded on appeal are managed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office which functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.  </p><p>All claim decisions taken by the Department&rsquo;s Deciding Officers and Designated Persons are appealable to the Chief Appeals Officer.  In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and approximately 2% are appealed. </p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was incorrect.  It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person.</p><p>Where the decision was not revised by the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the person concerned as the appeal process proceeds and in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the person concerned in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Table 1 below shows the outcome of appeals finalised by assistance

It provides supports and services to help support people on low incomes and facing financial hardship.</p><p>This scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>The Government has provided funding of &euro;45.75 million for the provision of  Additional Needs Payment in 2022.  A further provision of &euro;5.3 million has been provided for SWA Supplements in 2022 (excluding rent supplement).  The scheme is demand led and is funded accordingly.  The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently receiving a social welfare payment or working on a low income.  </p><p>An additional needs payments  can be a single payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income or may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. </p><p>Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>Table 1 shows the number by category of ENPs and UNPs paid by month for May and June 2022.</p><p>Table 2 shows the total expenditure by category of ENPs and UNPs paid by month for May and June 2022.</p><p>This represents a snapshot of claim activity taken at 4th July 2022 and is subject to change.</p><p>The payment amount, which can have a wide range value, will depend on a person&rsquo;s weekly household income, their outgoings and the type of assistance needed, therefore an average payment amount may not be representative of the trend in payments.</p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p><b>Table 1 - The number by category of Additional needs payments</b>(  <b>ENPs and UNPs) paid by month for May and June 2022</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Month </th>       <th>Bills </th>       <th>Child Related</th>       <th>Clothing </th>       <th>Funeral </th>       <th>General </th>       <th>Housing </th>       <th>Illness </th>       <th>Urgent Needs Payment</th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May </td>       <td>174 </td>       <td>222 </td>       <td>4,843 </td>       <td>267 </td>       <td>1,602 </td>       <td>1,703 </td>       <td>84 </td>       <td>26 </td>       <td>8,921 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June </td>       <td>188 </td>       <td>171 </td>       <td>4,747 </td>       <td>250 </td>       <td>1,801 </td>       <td>1,810 </td>       <td>118 </td>       <td>54 </td>       <td>9,139 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>362</b></td>       <td><b>393</b></td>       <td><b>9,590</b></td>       <td><b>517</b></td>       <td><b>3,403</b></td>       <td><b>3,513</b></td>       <td><b>202</b></td>       <td><b>80</b></td>       <td><b>18,060</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 - The total expenditure by category of ENPs and UNPs paid by month for May and June 2022</b></p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Month </th>       <th>Bills </th>       <th>Child Related</th>       <th>Clothing </th>       <th>Funeral </th>       <th>General </th>       <th>Housing </th>       <th>Illness </th>       <th>Urgent Needs Payment</th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May </td>       <td>&euro;113,191 </td>       <td>&euro;38,210 </td>       <td>&euro;798,276 </td>       <td>&euro;642,411 </td>       <td>&euro;345,398 </td>       <td>&euro;2,650,575 </td>       <td>&euro;12,654 </td>       <td>&euro;22,415 </td>       <td>&euro;4,623,130 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June </td>       <td>&euro;122,521 </td>       <td>&euro;29,990 </td>       <td>&euro;697,212 </td>       <td>&euro;648,871 </td>       <td>&euro;444,840 </td>       <td>&euro;2,883,745 </td>       <td>&euro;19,996 </td>       <td>&euro;56,095 </td>       <td>&euro;4,903,270 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;235,712</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;68,200</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;1,495,488</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;1,291,282</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;790,238</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;5,534,320</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;32,650</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;78,510</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;9,526,400</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Note:</b>These figures in tables 1 and 2 are taken from the Department&rsquo;s ENP/UNP database and represent a snapshot of the ENPs/UNPs as they are approved by an officer rather than when they are paid.

It is a targeted payment to people dependent on specified long-term social welfare payments.  The purpose of this payment is to assist those households most in need with their energy costs.  </p><p>In Budget 2022, the Government increased the weekly means threshold for the Fuel Allowance scheme by &euro;20 to &euro;120, which enables more people to qualify for this support. </p><p>The Fuel Allowance is a household payment, and in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, an applicant and members of his/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;600.30 per week.  The &euro;600.30 limit is equivalent<b></b>to the maximum State Pension (Contributory) rate for a single person aged under 80 of &euro;253.30, plus an adult dependent rate of &euro;227.00 plus &euro;120.00.</p><p>The allowable means limit ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p><p>Any decision to further increase the allowable means for the Fuel Allowance payment would have budgetary consequences and can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources. </p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over.</p>  <p>  It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.  </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance. Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. </p>  <p>  Once the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster care allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it. </p></reply>

Every year, more than 100,000 children participate on the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidises up to 80,000 children. </p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas. </p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%.  </p><p>In April of this year, City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) undertook a nationwide survey of capacity in early learning and childcare services. This survey was followed in May by the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal. </p><p>Preliminary analysis of the latest data captured by CCC and Pobal reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13%. </p><p>The network of CCC are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. </p><p>To address issues of under supply in the immediate term, CCC are proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of undersupply.  </p><p>A range of other steps are also being taken.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.</p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.  Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. </p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review.   </p>  <p>  Further, Tusla has advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted their view that the foster care allowance should be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Once the Strategic Plan on Foster Care is finalised by Tusla, it will then be considered by the Department. Any decision to review the current rate of the foster allowance shall be informed by the Tusla Plan and the consultations that have preceded it. </p></reply>

The primary purpose of Core Funding is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p><p>Extensive communications on Core Funding have issued to the sector, and public information is being maintained at: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding/. This site includes the Core Funding Partner Service Funding Agreement and accompanying frequently asked questions (FAQ) note which were published on 28th June. The Funding Agreement sets out the full detail of how Core Funding will operate in its first year, the commitment to funding and the associated requirements of Partner Services. </p><p>Core Funding, with a full year value of &euro;221 million, equivalent to an estimated increase of 19% in the cost base for the sector. The budget for the scheme makes provision for improvements in staff pay and conditions, for additional administrative staff/time, and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs. It is important to note that both contact and non-contact time, holiday pay, sick pay and other employer costs, are all factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding.</p><p>There is also provision as part of the budget to contribute to supporting graduate leadership in services.  This will make funding for graduates available for the first time in respect of provision for 0-3 year olds as well as supporting the employment of graduate Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. </p><p>The allocation mechanism for distributing this funding is fair and proportionate and is related to the primary drivers of services' costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours, offering more places and offering places for younger children will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. </p><p>Core Funding rates are outlined in the Funding Agreement. I would encourage providers to read the Funding Agreement in full, but some of the key conditions from the Funding Agreement include: </p><p>- Participating in the Annual Sector Profile.</p><p>- Operating a fee management system, which requires no increase to fees in 2022/23 above September 2021 rates.</p><p>- Implementing practice frameworks. </p><p>- Developing, implementing and reporting on a quality action plan.</p><p>- Providing transparent and validated financial reports.</p><p>- Issuing a Parent Statement to all parents using the service outlining what they can expect.</p><p>- Offering the NCS and the ECCE programme to all eligible children.</p><p>The application process will open later this month. Applicants will define their service&rsquo;s profile and their capacity in detail on an online system. On completion of the application, the service&rsquo;s specific Core Funding value will be calculated and communicated to applicants, subject to final verifications and confirmations.</p><p>A Ready Reckoner is available to provide an indication of the potential funding allocation an eligible ELC/SAC service may be able to expect.  </p><p>Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding and I look forward to working with Partner Services under this new funding model.</p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. </p><p>To date, more than 39,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 29,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p><p>Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging.

The legislation places a statutory duty on Tusla to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  It sets the legislative provisions in relation to taking children into care, and the responsibilities of the Sate in that regard, which aim to improve outcomes for looked after children.</p>  <p>  There are a number of ways in which a child may come into the care of Tusla. Section 4 of the Act allows for a child to be taken into the care of Tusla on a voluntary basis for a determined period of time without the need for a care order, subject to the agreement and wishes of the parent. </p>  <p>  Alternatively, the Act provides Tusla with the legislative basis to remove a child from his or her family environment, following a successful application for a care order to a Court. The Act specifies the different types of care order, which will determine the type and duration of the subsequent alternative care placement. These include Emergency Care Orders, Interim Care Orders, Care Orders and Special Care Orders.</p>  <p>  The conditions required for a court to make a Care Order in respect of a child are specified in Part IV of the Act. </p>  <p>  There are three types of alternative care operating in Ireland: foster care, residential care, and special care. These arrangements are in place in order to meet the differing needs and circumstances of children in the care of the State.  Tusla has advised that at the end of April 2022 there were 5,869 children in the care of the State.</p>  <p>  Further, the United Nations Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, 2009, specified foster care as the most desirable form of alternative care for children. As such it is noteworthy that the vast majority of looked after children in Ireland reside in foster care. Tusla has advised that approximately 90% of children in care, reside in foster care.</p></reply>

Tusla has stated that when a young person needs to come into the care of Tusla an individual assessment of need, care plan and pre-placement risk assessment is carried out and put in place to ensure that the child&rsquo;s needs are best met in the most appropriate placement.</p>  <p>  Children are placed in residential care to provide a safe, nurturing environment for them when they cannot live at home or in an alternative family environment such as foster care.  </p>  <p>  Residential centres are community based and are supported by the same range of health and social care services available to the rest of the population.  Where Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres differ however, is that Centres are staffed on a 24-hour basis by Social Care Workers, Social Care Leaders and Managers.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that they do not collate data specific to &ldquo;children at risk&rdquo;. Data collated relates to the number of children in Tusla care.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that at the end of April 2022 there were 5,869 children in care and of these 439 were in residential care.  Of the 439 children in residential care, 424 were in general residential care and 15 were in special care.  This data refers to children in centres registered as residential centres under the Child Care Act 1991.  There were an additional 49 children in &ldquo;other&rdquo; residential centres, which includes, for example disability centres and drug/alcohol rehabilitation centres.</p></reply>

My Department has policy responsibility for public law child care proceedings and the Department of Justice has responsibility for private family law proceedings, which include proceedings relating to separation, divorce and child custody cases.</p>  <p>  In terms of public law child care proceedings, my Department is currently progressing the Child Care (Amendment) Bill through the Oireachtas. The purpose of this Bill is to regulate and extend the system of guardian ad litem appointments. The role of the guardian ad litem is to ascertain the views of the child, communicate these to the court and to make recommendations as to what is in the best interests of the child.</p>  <p>  The Bill also contains amendments to the Child Care Act 1991, which are intended to reflect the intent of the 31st Amendment to the Constitution (the Children&rsquo;s Referendum). The Bill specifically provides that in any proceedings before a court in relation to the care and protection of a child, under the Child Care Act, the court is obliged to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.</p>  <p>  The Bill further provides that where a child is capable of forming their own views in any child care proceedings, the court must determine how to facilitate the child in expressing their views. The court must then give any views that the child wishes to express due weight, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.</p>  <p>  As regards private family law, as the Deputy will be aware, there is no specialist family court structure in Ireland at present. The Department of Justice published the General Scheme of the Family Court Bill in September 2020 which aims to establish a Family Court Division within the existing court structures. My Department is contributing to this process by participating in the Family Justice Oversight Group. The aim of this Group is to identify ways to modernise and improve family justice and people&rsquo;s experience of the system.</p></reply>

The GAL has an important role in that they are required to ascertain the views of the child and communicate these to the court. They are also required to make recommendations to the court as to what is in the best interests of the child. </p>  <p>  This is an important role which gives a voice to vulnerable children during care proceedings; however the current system of GAL appointments is unregulated and ad hoc. The existing legislative provisions do not set out the qualifications and experience necessary to work as a GAL. The role and functions are not defined, and there is no requirement on the court to appoint a GAL. These factors have led to inconsistencies in service provision across the country, which is a matter of concern to me. </p>  <p>  To address these issues, I have brought forward the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2022. This Bill is intended to regulate and expand the provision of the GAL service in a consistent manner across the country. The provisions of the Bill will enhance the rights of children and will ensure that high quality assistance is available to the courts. The Bill has completed its passage through the D&aacute;il and is shortly due before the Seanad. </p></reply>

The modular unit, c 1,700 sq.m., will be located at the FET campus at the former D&uacute;n U&iacute; Neill Army barracks and will be operational by September. This modular accommodation is to address immediate accommodation needs. This development will enable the delivery of a range of PLC programmes, including but not limited to: music production, science, beauty, sports, animal care, sports therapy and general skills programmes. It will also provide canteen and sports facilities and office space. Works are well advanced on the delivery of this project for the new academic year.</p></reply>

Part-time courses are not currently eligible for support under the 2022 Scheme. In 2021 I approved a review of the Student Grant Scheme to ensure that adequate student supports are in place, alongside the sustainable funding model for the sector. One of the recommendations from the DG Reform&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme is the need for a policy proposal for the re-design of the higher education funding system in Ireland that would provide equity in access, efficiency in the investment of public resources and sustainability in the face of strong demographic growth.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme review raised the issue of flexible learning citing that many socio economically disadvantaged students would have considered part-time if the option had been available to them. This aligns with the findings of the consultation undertaken for the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education which identified the need for the sector to provide flexible learning options for people disadvantaged by socio-economic barriers, mature students, students with a disability and members of the travelling community.</p>  <p>  I officially launched both reports on May 4th and am committed to implementing the recommendations in a phased way, in the context of successive annual Estimates processes. This summer in advance of the Estimates process,  I intend to publish a paper outlining potential options and impacts, to be considered in the Budgetary process, related to the Student Grant scheme and other programmes related to student supports and costs of higher education, including with respect to those priorities identified in the Student Grant Scheme Review.</p>  <p>  The issue of potentially expanding part-time delivery of tertiary education in Ireland is a complex one and significant planning will need to be conducted at both national and institution level to manage the significant supply-side impacts on educational institutions. An internal working group has been established within my Department to support lifelong learning and explore the extension of financial supports to include part-time students.</p>  <p>  Part-time students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF.</p>  <p>  Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

It is therefore my objective to ensure that there is access into either further or higher education for each person who wishes to pursue educational options at third-level. </p>  <p>  Our higher education system has expanded significantly over the past number of years, from 209,300 enrolments in 2014 to 245,700 enrolments in 2020. The most recent projections of full-time enrolment in higher education predict that enrolments will rise a further 13% over the next decade, and work is ongoing to build capacity within the system to accommodate this increase. </p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing on an updated set of enrolment projections for higher education, which will further assist in this capacity-building programme of work.  My Department does not currently produce specific projections for the number of higher education graduates, as a number of variables can impact graduate output in any one year. </p>  <p>  On 28th June, I announced the creation of more than 1,000 places across a range of disciplines. These places were created following extensive engagements between my officials, the HEA and the higher education sector. The places are in areas of key skills needs, as identified by the national skills architecture, and will be permanent additions in the system. Some of the areas in which these places are being created include ICT, Architecture and Construction, Nursing and other healthcare, Engineering and Environment.</p>  <p>  There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. Central to shaping these strategies is the partnership approach between the Further and Higher Education system and Government, Industry, the National Skills Council, the National Training Fund Advisory Group, the Regional Skills Fora and the Apprenticeship Council.</p>  <p>  The National Skills Council (NSC) within its remit advises on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on how to secure delivery of these needs. Key high level trends identified at recent NSC meetings include automation and digitisation, digital literacy and transversal skills. Information on these trends is then used to formulate our skills strategies and initiatives such as the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to advance efforts to ensure that Ireland offers learning opportunities to all who wish to pursue then, and produces the graduates the workforce needs with the skills that our economy and society require. </p></reply>

It is firmly focused on responding in an agile and flexible way to priority skill needs, and to changes in the world of work driven by technology, to ensure Ireland has a skilled and productive workforce.</p>  <p>  The National Skills Council and Regional Skills Fora operating under the National Skills Strategy, foster engagement, dialogue, and collaboration between relevant Government Departments and agencies, the education and training system, the enterprise agencies, and enterprise  representatives in relation to skills priorities.</p>  <p>  The skills ecosystem also encompasses the labour market information entities including the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  This skills infrastructure informs and drives responsive and flexible forecasting, planning, and provision to meet skills requirements across all sectors of the economy.  It has an important role to play in identifying skills provision shortfalls to be addressed by the education and training system and concerns relating to labour shortages in particular sectors that relate to other factors.     </p>  <p>  Through 2022, Ireland, in partnership with the OECD, is reviewing Ireland&rsquo;s skills strategies, policies and approaches. This will be central to our economic and social sustainability against the backdrop of major trends impacting on the workforce and society including digitalisation and climate transition.  The work of the OECD is firmly grounded in extensive stakeholder consultation, including specific engagements focused on the needs of regional enterprises and SMEs.</p></reply>

This data is collated in the Higher Education Institutional Staff Profiles by Gender, which provide information on key indicators which contribute to the assessment of gender equality in Irish HEIs and offer a valuable baseline from which progress can be measured. There is a continued increase in the representation of females in HEI leadership (which now stands at 50%), in governance and management structures and at senior academic levels. In the University sector the percentage of female professors has risen from 19% in 2016 when the Staff Profiles were first published to 30% at the end of 2021. The profiles are published annually and can be accessed on HEA website.

Since the go-live of the scorecards, my officials inform me that there has not been any reduction in the number of applications being received when compared to previous years. However, a preliminary review of applications received in recent weeks indicates that the quality of the applications has markedly improved.</p>  <p>  This is a welcome development and builds on other innovative measures recently introduced in the citizenship application process, including the deployment of &ldquo;Tara&rdquo; the e-chat bot, e-payments, e-tax clearance, Garda e-vetting, and the removal of the requirement to provide the original passport when making an application. All of these measures have positively enhanced the applicant's experience.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that for some applicants the scorecard may not have adequately addressed their individual circumstances.  In such cases, the Citizenship Division of my Department may accept a sworn affidavit, which could make up the deficit in points to enable the applicant to meet the necessary threshold. The affidavit will not be accepted in lieu of all appropriate proofs, only to make up the shortfall to enable the score of 150 points to be reached.</p>  <p>  A previous examination by my Department of the citizenship application process indicated that incorrectly submitted applications were diverting considerable resources from general processing, resulting in the slowing down of all applications and adversely impacting on customer service. </p>  <p>  Considerable effort has therefore gone into clarifying the application guidelines published on my Department's immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie) and on making the application process itself more customer friendly, including the introduction of the new scorecard structure for proof of identity and residence.</p></reply>

These types of attacks cannot, and will not, be tolerated.</p><p>On 16 April 2021, I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Hatred and Hate Crime) Bill 2021 following an extensive public consultation. The General Scheme was then referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny. This took place in November 2021 and the report was published in April 2022.</p><p>I am committed to advancing work on the Bill this year. </p><p>This Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.  The aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty, compared to the ordinary offence, and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.</p><p>Following receipt of the Justice Committee&rsquo;s report in April, my officials have been examining the recommendations made. Some of these recommendations have required further legal advice, and consultation with key stakeholders. </p><p>I was very glad to meet recently during Pride week with representatives of the LGBTI+ non-governmental organisations to discuss a range of concerns including their wish to see this Bill enacted as soon as possible.</p><p>Drafting of the Bill is underway with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, and I expect that the Bill will be published in the coming period.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate the strong emotional attachment we all have to our pets and that theft not only leads to their loss in our lives, but also a high level of concern for their welfare. It is also a crime which often affects, and is indeed often targeted against, older and particularly vulnerable people, for whom their pet is of huge emotional importance.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that theft offences already apply to this crime, and can carry very heavy penalties. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.</p><p>When imposing sentence, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet &ndash; the emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence is absolutely relevant and can be, and is, taken into account where appropriate. However, I acknowledge that the existing offence considers the offence as being one against property rather than a person or an animal and I am committed to examining the options to address the issue, including, if necessary, making legislative changes.</p><p>From an enforcement perspective, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes this issue very seriously and has conducted several important actions against those responsible. Garda&iacute; have also disseminated information through the national Crime Prevention Officer Network regarding keeping animals secure and preventing these forms of theft. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety, which is in line with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe, can be viewed on the Garda website.</p><p>I would like to emphasise the importance of microchipping. Every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age, or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth (Microchipping of Dogs Regulation 2015), and the microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals&rsquo; welfare, and assists with speedy identification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners. It is an offence to keep a dog over 12 weeks that has not been chipped and it is an offence to sell such a dog. Microchips can be easily checked at vets and by Garda&iacute;. They are by far and away the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture have also made regulations covering the advertising for sale of animals under the Animal Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pets Regulations) 2019.</p><p>The Deputy will note from the figures from PULSE in the table below that the number of dog thefts to date in 2022 is considerably lower than in the preceding years, particularly 2020 and 2021 during the Covid pandemic. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>2022* </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dog Theft Incidents</td>       <td>60 </td>       <td>70 </td>       <td>121 </td>       <td>116 </td>       <td>25 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Stolen Dogs</td>       <td>145 </td>       <td>204 </td>       <td>228 </td>       <td>280 </td>       <td>41 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*2022 information is up to and inclusive of 05 July 2022 Figures are operational and subject to change.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. </p>  <p>  Eligible  employees must have been employed between 1st of March 2020 and 30th of June 2021 and  have been identified as working in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments. Employees who worked less than 4 weeks in the specified period are not in scope. </p>  <p>  Please be assured that the Government is very mindful of others who played their important part during this difficult period. It was tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which workers faced during this critical time period. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022.

There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community.</p>  <p>  Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.  Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. As of the 1st of May 2022, there are no GMS GP vacancies in Palmerstown.  </p>  <p>  Where a GMS patient experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept him/her as a patient, the person concerned having unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area (or fewer if there are fewer GPs in the area) can apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit which has the power to assign a GMS patient to a GP's GMS patient list. </p>  <p>  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement on GP contractual reform and service development will see the Government increase annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with an intake of 258 planned for this year.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

Both of these satellite centres are successfully delivering a new model of ambulatory and urgent care for children and adolescents in the Greater Dublin Area.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the Government approved a capital budget of &euro;1.433bn for the NCH project. This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. The capital budget has not yet been depleted and to date, just over &euro;1bn (73%) of the &euro;1.433bn budget has been drawn down for works on the project across the three sites.</p>  <p>  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainty for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation in excess of the 4% threshold in the construction contract, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes, and the Employment Order.</p>  <p>  Tender inflation is based on external factors within the construction industry that are not in the control of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB).  The construction contract for the NCH, provides for a risk-sharing mechanism for construction inflation. As set out in the Contract, national construction inflation is calculated by the averaging of three published indices, with the contractor bearing the costs of the first 4% of construction inflation, and where tender inflation above 4% is recoverable from the NPHDB.  This came into effect from August 2019.  </p>  <p>  The Government has identified the risk of construction inflation in this current economic environment is not tenable, viable or sustainable for the construction industry to achieve the goals outlined in the National Development Plan 2021 &ndash; 2030 and acted accordingly. In November 2021 and May 2022, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Michael McGrath T.D., announced measures to address the impact that exceptional inflation in construction sector and energy is having on public works contracts. </p>  <p>  In recognition that neither party is responsible for the global events that have given rise to inflation, the &ldquo;Inflation Co-operation Framework&rdquo; apportions the additional inflation costs between the parties, with, subject to budgetary constraints, the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary related costs.</p>  <p>  However, for a project as advanced as the new children&rsquo;s hospital, the new Framework does not apply. The collaborative, risk-sharing approach contained in the construction contract for the NCH remains. Total inflation payments for 2019, 2020 and 2021 have been &euro;21million. Construction inflation figures for 2022 will not be available until 2023 and any additional inflation costs for 2022 will fall due for payment in 2023.  However, the compound effect of the unprecedented increase in construction inflation will be a driver of additional costs for the capital project.</p>  <p>  Additional costs in relation to the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites brings the total programme cost to &euro;1.73bn. This includes investment in ICT, a new Electronic Health Record system, and the Children's Hospital Integration Programme (the merging of three paediatric hospitals) including commissioning.</p>  <p>  Brexit, the pandemic and recent geopolitical developments have severely impacted supply chains and NCH project is not immune to these external challenges. Every effort is being taken to mitigate the risks but these externalities beyond the control of the contractor and the NPHDB make speculation and more definitive forecasting unwise.</p>  <p>  Definitive updates on costs cannot be provided due to the fact that we are talking about a live contract and speculation on any costs will be detrimental to the Development Board&rsquo;s commercial engagements.</p>  <p>  As the NPHDB has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital, I have referred your queries regarding the current contractual position and price variation clause for inflation to the NPHDB for direct reply.</p></reply>

In relation to insourcing, a public hospital may have some spare capacity but require further funding in order to utilise it. Such public hospitals may make a proposal to the NTPF, whereby the NTPF pay a fixed price per procedure performed.

The Programme is co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Union and has been the principal source of funding in recent years for the sustainable development of our seafood sector.  The Programme has been a great success in distributing funding to support our fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing sectors with capital investment, innovation, advisory services, training, marketing and Covid supports.  At the end of 2021, the last date for which official data is available, funds of &euro;233.8 million had been committed to projects through grant approvals (97.2%).  Implementation of the Programme continues in 2022 and indeed some approved projects will not complete until 2023.  By the time the Programme closes on 31 December 2023, I expect full draw down of funds.  </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department is finalising a new programme for the 2021-27 period under the new European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF).  The process of preparing the programme has been ongoing for some time, and I anticipate a final public consultation shortly before submitting the programme to the Commission in the Autumn, for its adoption before the end of 2022.  The consultation will set out my final proposals for measures to be supported and the distribution of the funds across the four EMFAF priorities.

The TB Eradication Programme in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) under the United Kingdom government. </p><p>The table below details the number of herds experiencing a new restriction due to bovine TB, since 1st January each year, by county over the past 10 years to date, and the number of reactors related to these restrictions within this jurisdiction. </p><p>This disease causes considerable hardship for farmers and farming families, and my Department, working together with stakeholders and engaging with farmers, are committed to eradicating this disease. </p><p>The causes of TB outbreaks are complex, and can vary from area to area, requiring a range of actions to address the problem. The TB programme in each county focuses on factors including wildlife, how disease is distributed in the area, contiguous programmes, gamma interferon testing, cleansing and disinfection, testing compliance and frequency and isolation of reactors.  Each TB outbreak is investigated by a veterinary inspector to identify the source of infection. In the case of every outbreak involving two or more standard reactors, there is a veterinary visit to advise the herdowner on how to eliminate infection and necessary measures to assist in reducing the risk of recurrence. Emphasis is placed on biosecurity measures a farmer can take to reduce risks on his or her farm, and when buying in animals.</p><p>In 2021, I launched a new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030. Implementation is overseen by the Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum with support from three working groups on science, implementation and finance to ensure that all aspects of the Strategy are addressed.  We now have the building blocks in place to lower disease incidence and reduce the challenges associated with a TB restriction. Details of the new TB Strategy are available on www.bovinetb.ie.</p></reply>

The Act provides inter alia that a principal object of the company is to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices. </p>  <p>  The company is self-financing and is not the recipient of Exchequer funding, and indeed has a responsibility to return a profit and make dividend payments to the state in addition to delivering on the State's forestry priorities. That is not to say that the company focuses solely on commercial activities. For instance 20% of Coillte forests are managed for the protection of biodiversity and habitats.</p>  <p>  In order to meet this remit Coillte currently operates across various business strands including forestry, land management, panel products and renewable energy businesses. The company manages an estate of some 440,000 hectares of which just under 400,000 hectares is forested.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Coillte launched its new forestry strategic vision on 21st April last, following engagement with a number of stakeholders including my Department. There is close alignment  between Coillte's strategic vision and the proposed new national forestry strategy and Forestry Programme, currently under development within my Department and this has been facilitated by  Coillte's participation in Working Group 2 of Project Woodland. Project Woodland is an initiative of Minister Hackett to among other things encourage woodland creation in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Coillte is adapting its approach and practices to meet the emerging climate and biodiversity challenges, while fulfilling its remit as a commercial entity, and that this approach will deliver on the multiple benefits that their forests have to offer for  people, the economy and the environment. </p></reply>

Both schemes will be voluntary for farmers to participate in.  </p>  <p>  The Eco-Scheme will be an annual scheme with the option to opt-in or opt-out each year. It will be comprised of a menu of eight agricultural practices, with farmers required to complete two practices in a given year. One of these practices will require the planting of three native trees or one metre of hedgerow per hectare per annum. In cases where a farmer increases the planting rate to six trees or two metres of hedgerow per hectare per annum, s/he will qualify for the full Eco-scheme payment. The Eco-Scheme will aim to engage as many farmers as possible, and it is therefore hoped that this option will provide the basis for the planting of significant numbers of trees over the period of the Plan. </p>  <p>  The ACRES (Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme) will be a multi-annual scheme which will include an option for farmers to plant trees and/or hedges. They will have the option to select actions based around planting trees in rows, groups or parkland.  In addition, farmers are also proposed to be offered actions relating to planting trees in riparian buffer strips as well as potentially planting tree belts adjacent to farmyards with a view to capturing ammonia.</p></reply>

An annual afforestation target of 8,000 hectares is outlined in the Plan.</p>  <p>  The current Forestry Programme which commenced in 2015 and has been extended to the end of 2022 provides significant supports for afforestation. This includes grants and premiums for 12 different planting categories to promote a good species mix and covers 100% of the cost of establishing a forest</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, afforestation levels have been declining in recent years and Project Woodland was established in February 2021 to ensure that a new impetus is brought to woodland creation in Ireland.  A national shared vision for the future of Ireland's trees and forests and a new Forestry Strategy are currently being developed. This new Forest Strategy will underpin a new Forestry Programme for the period 2023 - 2027.  Supports will be included in the next Forestry Programme to incentivise afforestation. I am committed to working with all our stakeholders to substantially increase our afforestation rates over the next decade. </p>  <p>  Current Government Policy, through the Climate Action Plan, sets afforestation targets in excess of 8,000 ha. However, I am also aware that afforestation is a voluntary land use choice for landowners. Any target that is set must be realistic and we have set an ambitious target which is a significant step up from existing levels achieved in recent years.</p></reply>

It is my priority this year to  increase the number of licences issued to 5,250.</p><p>Up to 30th June, we have issued 2,449 licences, just behind the projected average of 2,625.  It is, however, inevitable, in the context of the annual target figures, there will be fluctuations in licence output and across categories from week to week. We have devoted extra resources to licensing and I remain confident that by year end we will achieve our projected targets.  In June  we achieved our overall target for the month.</p><p>As regards RUS while we committed in our Licensing Plan to increasing output this year, the Plan does not include an annual target as many RUS applications are screened in for Appropriate Assessment and are referred to ecology.  Of these, any that propose replacing the ash crop with conifer species currently require planning permission.</p><p>We have had successful engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in relation to this requirement for planning permission. From those discussions we expect that legislation to remove the requirement for planning permission in all cases under 10 hectares will be introduced after the Summer recess.</p><p>I attach a table outlining output vs target in each of the licensing categories.</p><p>In the interest of full transparency details of all licences issued by category are available on the weekly dashboard. This is published on the Departmental website and is made available to all interested parties as well as being submitted to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine each week.</p></reply>

A rapid stamping out policy was implemented on all infected premises, followed by implementation of all necessary disposal, cleaning and disinfection protocols. My Department depopulated approximately 30,000 birds in 2020 and approximately 200,000 in 2021 as part of this disease control process.</p><p>In relation to the monitoring of avian influenza in wild birds, my Department operates a monitoring programme throughout the year. The first wild bird case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Ireland during the past Avian Influenza season was confirmed on November 3<sup>rd</sup>2021 in a peregrine falcon submitted to Limerick Regional Veterinary Laboratory. Following confirmation of the presence of disease, DAFM reinforced its online and social media awareness campaigns to alert poultry stakeholders and the wider public of the presence of circulating virus, and the appropriate measures to take as a result.</p><p>A total of 85 wild bird positives have been confirmed during the high-risk period between November 2021 and April 2022 across 16 counties. There has only been one additional confirmed case of H5N1 in a wild bird since April 2022. The Department continues to submit wild birds to its laboratories for Avian Influenza testing.</p><p>My Department liaises closely with the authorities in the UK and elsewhere in relation to monitoring and controlling avian influenza outbreaks.  </p></reply>

Where there are overriding environmental considerations, e.g. the felling and non-replanting is intended to protect habitats and species listed as qualifying interests within SACs and SPAs;</p><p>2.  To support renewable energy and energy security, e.g. a large scale windfarm installations;</p><p>3. Large scale commercial development inter alia likely to generate significant economic benefits for the local economy and community at large, e.g. a data centre;</p><p>4. Conversion of forest land to agricultural land; and</p><p>5. The provision of important public utilities and infrastructure, e.g. a gas pipeline or a high voltage electricity transmission line.</p><p>In response to the impact of ash dieback on plantations nation-wide, we offer support to owners under the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) scheme, details of which are found at this link on gov.ie:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/service/ddc94-reconstitution-and-underplanting-scheme-ash-dieback/.</p><p>If this owner does not wish to avail of RUS and wishes instead to convert  to another land use a felling licence application would need to be submitted along with a case for conversion.  When received my officials can then examine the context of the application and engage with the applicant.  In such cases, if successful, the landowner / applicant would normally have to:</p><p>a. Refund any payments received from the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme under which the forest was planted;</p><p>b. Comply with the Department&rsquo;s requirements, as they currently are, regarding the afforestation of alternative lands in lieu of the lands deforested.</p><p>In addition the application would need to be consistent with our stated policy per the Felling and Reforestation Policy document.</p></reply>

This aim of such a grant is to improve the quality of afforestation applications in particular as they address environmental aspects, to increase the throughput of applications by my Department and to ensure applicants and their agents are reasonably reimbursed for the additional costs associated with the required standard and scope of environmental reports.</p>  <p>  My Department has now introduced an environmental grant which will form part of the 1st instalment Afforestation grant to be paid in 2022, in cases where an environmental report has been submitted. This additional grant payment pays &euro;450/ hectare for the first hectare, &euro;400 for the second hectare, &euro;350 for the third hectare and &euro;50/hectare from 4 hectares capped at 20 hectares.</p>  <p>  There is a wide variation in the cost of environmental reports depending on the circumstances of each case.  Most will require a habitat map but some will require more than one report. This payment regime covers the average cost of such reports and is in general expected to cover the costs incurred for most sites. </p>  <p>  There is no extra burden on applicants or their registered foresters in accessing this payment, as we will accept their Form 2 application as sufficient to apply for the grant and we do not require the submission of invoices to support the payment.</p></reply>

Key to the success of increasing afforestation rates is to build confidence among landowners of the benefits of forestry as a viable option to complement existing enterprises. </p>  <p>  The changes introduced as part of the Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022, allow the introduction of Regulations to facilitate small scale planting of native tree areas without the need to first obtain an afforestation licence, any approvals issued under such a scheme will count as afforestation.</p></reply>
