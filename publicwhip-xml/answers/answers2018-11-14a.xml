The active management of these lands and the wider publicly owned land bank is one of a range of complementary actions being progressed under the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and the recently established Land Development Agency will play an important role in this regard. </p>  <p>  To date, State-led residential construction has focused primarily on helping to meet the needs of households in the lowest income brackets, through the social housing programme. With increased investment to deliver over 50,000 new social homes over the period 2016 to 2021, some 33,500 of which will be delivered through build programmes, the social housing construction programme has increased significantly in recent years.  This is reflected in the social housing construction status report at end Q2 this year, which included 1,067 schemes delivering over 16,351 homes, a 48% increase on the position a year earlier.  This includes turnkey developments on private lands which can also play an important part in social housing delivery, particularly in areas where local authorities may have limited access to lands. </p>  <p>  A targeted approach is now also being pursued to support local authorities to open up lands for affordable housing. To this end, I have provided additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  As of Budget 2019, a total of &euro;310 million will be provided for this purpose over the course of 2019 to 2021.  The combination of this Fund and the significantly increased funding for the social housing programme will open up more significant opportunities for larger mixed-tenure developments and my Department will be continuing to engage proactively with local authorities to accelerate the delivery of these projects.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-14a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400072#WRB00800"><p>The Government&rsquo;s Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 sets the broad policy context for the development of water services, including the position of Irish Water as the single, publicly owned water services authority.  </p>  <p>  In July 2018, the Government decided that Irish Water would become a standalone publicly owned, commercial, regulated utility separated from the Ervia Group during 2023.  This was considered to be in the best strategic interests of the water services and gas networks businesses and would enhance the heightened level of transparency and accountability required for Irish Water, given the level of Exchequer funding being provided to it.  This decision was based on Departmental analysis, supported by input from NewERA.  It is important to note that in establishing Irish Water within the Bord G&aacute;is (now Ervia) Group initially, this was on the basis that flexibility be maintained from the outset to allow for the potential separation of Irish Water at a future date.    </p>  <p>  On 19 September 2018, I received a report from the Director General of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) in respect of a process of engagement that was undertaken at my request with the parties involved in the transformation programme for Irish Water, those being the utility itself, ICTU and relevant affiliated unions, Local Government management and my Department.  In this context, Irish Water has proposed fully integrating its operations and ending the current operational arrangements for the delivery of water services through service level agreements (SLAs) with local authorities.  The discussions with the parties have advanced on the basis that the current SLAs remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed.   </p>  <p>  In considering the report in consultation with my Government colleagues, I am particularly mindful of the WRC&rsquo;s comments that uncertainty about the next phase of transformation appears to be causing staffing difficulties at Local Government level and that further delay in providing the necessary clarity could exacerbate this situation and increase risks to the safe and effective delivery of water and wastewater services.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, in the interests of clarity, I am asking the parties to now engage in a process to work towards the development of a stable structural and operational framework for the future. I am grateful for the commitment of the WRC to facilitate this process.  My Department is currently communicating with the parties in this regard. </p>  <p>  In relation to the question of a constitutional amendment on the public ownership of water services, the position is that I undertook to endeavour to bring forward wording capable of being tabled as an amendment to the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016.  I will shortly update the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the latest progress in this regard. </p></reply>

The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to publication during the current Oireachtas session. The Bill intends to strengthen further the effectiveness of the rent setting and rent review laws by empowering the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to:  </p>  <p>  - investigate any contravention of the law regarding the 4% rent increase limits in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) and to take enforcement action, if necessary, including the imposition of sanctions on landlords in breach; and  </p>  <p>  - initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made.</p>  <p>  Last year, my Department conducted a review of the Rent Predictability Measure on the basis of RTB rent data and a public consultation on the operation of the Rent Pressure Zones.  The review findings have informed the framing of the Bill and the implementation of a change plan to develop and strengthen the role of the RTB, particularly with regard to enforcement.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 provides an additional provision of &euro;4.6 million, an increase of 67%, in funding to further resource and develop the RTB's capacity to implement tenancy law, expanding its overall role and function as part of a multiannual change management programme, and to expand the rental inspections programme by local authorities. A Project Board has been established to drive the development and implementation of the change management plan.  </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the RTB on an ongoing basis and will continue to do so in order to ensure that it is sufficiently resourced throughout this change process.</p></reply>

The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.  To this end, local authorities have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require that owners or occupiers take appropriate measures on derelict sites, to acquire derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and to apply a derelict sites levy on the registered owners of derelict sites. </p>  <p>  It is open to any person to contact a local authority in relation to a particular site which may be considered a derelict site for the purposes of the Act. Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a register of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site. Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the register for any local authority area can be inspected at the offices of the relevant authority. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas. </p>  <p>  Under the recently introduced provisions of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 both the Derelict Sites Levy and the Vacant Sites Levy will increase from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020, in respect of sites included on the respective local authority derelict and vacant site registers in 2019.  This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development while also combatting land hoarding. </p></reply>

Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks to help decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.</p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference.  Engineers Ireland has provided assurance that they will collaborate with the Department, the NSAI and others on measures to establish such a register once the standardised protocol is in place.</p><p>Last year, I visited Donegal and Mayo and met with key stakeholders, including affected homeowners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties. I made similar visits to both counties this year and continue to monitor the situation and to update affected parties on progress. I will be in a position to provide a further update following the publication of the standardised protocol in the coming weeks.</p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.</p><p>The putting in place of such a scheme is now a key priority for my Department and work is well underway on the development of such a scheme, including discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding.  It is intended to revert to Government with proposals for the scheme by the end of the year, with a view to publishing details of the scheme as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

This represents a decrease of 13,941 households or 16.2% on the last assessment in June 2017. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 71,858, a reduction of 22%. </p>  <p>  In terms of meeting the need of households on waiting lists, Rebuilding Ireland provides for a total of 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered through build, acquisition and leasing programmes and 87,000 additional households to be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme, over the 6 year period 2016 to 2021.  At end June 2018, over 57,000 households had their social housing need met, representing over 40% of the overall Rebuilding Ireland target. </p>  <p>  In 2019, funding of &euro;2.4 billion is being provided for the delivery of housing programmes, which will allow for the housing needs of almost 27,400 households to be met next year.  10,000 of these homes will be delivered through build, acquisition and long term leasing programmes.  </p>  <p>  My Department engages with all local authorities on a regular basis regarding the delivery of social housing. I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available to all local authorities under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for meeting our challenges in the housing sector and continuing to reduce the number of households on waiting lists.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.   </p>  <p>  As part of the allocation process, local authorities submit a programme of capital works for individual Traveller-specific projects and developments, which are assessed in my Department, in advance of allocations being made.

The actual outturn was &euro;4.835 million or 54% of the total allocation.  The 2018 exchequer provision for Traveller specific accommodation is &euro;12 million, an increase of 33% on the 2017 allocation.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, and reflecting the disappointing level of overall funding drawdown in recent years,  the Housing Agency, in 2017, commissioned a review of funding for traveller-specific accommodation to date.  This review had regard to targets contained in local authority TAPs and actual delivery, the current status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.   </p>  <p>  Following its consideration of the review, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee recommended that an Independent Expert Group be established to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.

Under the Act, planning authorities are required to establish a register of vacant sites in their areas, beginning on 1 January 2017.  Planning authorities have issued notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 November this year in respect of vacant sites included on their respective registers on 1 January 2018, indicating that the levy will apply to those sites on 1 January 2019. </p>  <p>  While all 31 local authorities have established vacant site registers, not all registers have been populated to date as some local authorities are undertaking the necessary preparatory work in this regard, such as identifying relevant vacant sites, their registered owners and commissioning the market valuations of such sites.  </p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and on-line on its website. </p>  <p>  On foot of a review of the on-line registers, I understand a total of 17 planning authorities have populated their vacant site registers with 298 sites, of which over 140 were on registers on 1 January 2018 and in respect of which the levy can be applied in January 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim.    </p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy in order to ensure a consistent application of the levy provisions across all city and county areas and to facilitate the sharing of best practice. My Department has provided guidance and advice and also organised three separate information seminars for local authorities, the most recent of which, in May 2018, was attended by officials from every local authority.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.  To support this work, my Department issued Circular PL 06/2018 on 3 October 2018. Part 3 of this Circular requested a progress report on implementation of the Vacant Site Levy to be completed by the Director of Planning in each Local Authority and returned to the Department by 31 October 2018.  My Department has received the majority of the progress reports, is currently following up on any outstanding returns and is also collating and reviewing the information received. </p></reply>

In order to support the affordable housing programmes of local authorities, the Government has committed &euro;310 million, over the three years 2019 to 2021, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) announced as part of Budget 2019. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p>  <p>  A first call for proposals under the Fund issued to the four Dublin local authorities; Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth and Cork County Councils, and Cork and Galway City Councils.  Fifteen proposals were received, from nine of the local authorities targeted under this first call and I expect to announce funding decisions in relation to these applications shortly. I expect infrastructure works on approved projects to begin as soon as possible thereafter and delivery of affordable homes from late 2019/early 2020 onwards.</p>  <p>  More broadly, all local authorities are carrying out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. My Department hosted a workshop for local authorities last week to discuss these issues. </p>  <p>  A second call for proposals under the Fund will be made shortly. The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned assessments, which they have been requested to submit by 30 November. </p>  <p>  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, for example, under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out further. The Regulations to support the operation of Part 5 will be finalised shortly. </p></reply>

Part V units are excluded from the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016 to ensure that units delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in Rebuilding Ireland, a review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation, including the issues referred to, has been undertaken.  The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. I hope to be in a position to publish the review shortly, following completion of consideration of a number of implementation issues arising.</p></reply>

The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.</p>  <p>  To enable more delivery of social and affordable homes on public lands, the Government has, in parallel with the establishment of the LDA, approved a new affordability requirement in relation to publicly-owned lands, whereby a minimum of 30% of any housing developed must be reserved for affordable purposes in addition to the 10% statutory social housing requirement under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, whether such development is being progressed by the LDA or any other market operator. Furthermore, public bodies, such as local authorities and the Housing Agency, engaging with the LDA in relation to their lands will also be in a position to condition the release of such lands for development to reflect their own policy requirements. Therefore, complying with the Government's new public lands affordability requirement above, the LDA will be capable of progressing a significant level of affordable housing, both for purchase and for rent, on lands forming part of its portfolio of sites, working within the broader policy framework for the delivery of affordable housing set by the Government.</p>  <p>  Significant preparatory work is required in relation to the initial portfolio of eight sites and as part of this process, funding structures will be devised on a case by case basis, taking account of the scale of each project, value for money for the State, risk and pace of delivery. </p>  <p>  The LDA is in the process of commencing feasibility, planning and other preparatory works on its sites, with construction envisaged to commence on the first homes in 2019 for delivery in 2020, with progress ramping up in line with an overall business plan which is also being advanced as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals.

My Department is engaged in consultations with the Office of the Attorney General to scope out, with the benefit of information provided by DES on the purpose built student accommodation (PBSA) sector, the legal feasibility of introducing related amendments in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 as it passes through the legislative process in the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that certain PBSA, provided by the private sector, let rooms on the basis of tenancy agreements that are registered with the Residential Tenancies Board. Others let their student rooms on the basis of licensing agreements which are not classified as a tenancy and, therefore, are not within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016.   </p>  <p>  If there is any doubt as to the type of agreement in place in respect of individual dwellings, for example whether it is a tenancy or licence, the matter should be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for a determination.  </p>  <p>  It is important that the design of any new regulatory system to be introduced is mindful of the pressing need to secure the delivery of the pipe-line of PBSA development in train and does not deter future necessary investment in the sector. Increasing the supply of rental accommodation for students is a priority for both my Department and for the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The NPF is a national plan, with a high-level ambition of creating a single vision, a shared set of goals for every community across the country, and to deliver on these in a way that makes sense for our communities, rural and urban alike.  </p>  <p>  The NPF recognises the need for sustainable and co-ordinated development of our towns, villages and rural communities.  To this end, Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies are also being developed, which will link strategic national planning and investment with regional-scale planning and the statutory development plan and local economic and community development planning functions of local authorities.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Action Plan for Rural Development, published on 23 January 2017 and led by my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, takes a whole-of-Government approach to the economic and social development of rural Ireland and acts as an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of rural initiatives across Government Departments and other public bodies. </p>  <p>  Steps are being taken under both Project Ireland 2040 and the Action Plan for Rural Development to enable more proactive action on unlocking the development potential of rural towns and villages.  These include the &euro;1bn Rural Regeneration and Development Fund under which local authorities and other public bodies and stakeholders were invited to make applications earlier this year and on which an initial tranche of decisions will be announced before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  On this basis, I am satisfied that a sufficiently flexible and robust policy and investment framework is in place to ensure that local authorities and other relevant stakeholders can take the necessary proactive steps in ensuring that redevelopment opportunities in rural towns and villages are maximised and that a sustainable alternative is available to the building of individual houses in wider rural and countryside areas.  Accordingly, I have no plans at present to carry out a review of the kind referred to. </p></reply>

The reports are collated on a regional basis and are published on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year a number of categorisation errors were identified in the reports for March and April.  This had involved the classification of individuals who were being accommodated in houses and apartments owned or leased by the local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies as being in emergency accommodation.  I requested a report on the full extent of this practice which was completed in September.  The report identified some further instances of local authority owned or leased houses and apartments being classified as emergency accommodation.  The categorisation of these properties as emergency accommodation have been amended by the relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  In relation to plans for the winter, all local authorities have been asked to put in place cold weather arrangements for rough sleepers.  Over 200 new permanent beds will be introduced across Dublin before the end of the year. In addition, 100 temporary emergency beds will be available in the Dublin region as part of the cold weather arrangements. </p>  <p>  The implementation plan for Housing First, published in September, will deliver permanent housing solutions for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation. The Plan contains targets for each local authority, with an overall national target of 660 tenancies to be delivered by 2021.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area, including Cavan and Monaghan, is underway. The Housing Agency is continuing to carry out the detailed statistical work, which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. </p>  <p>  The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.  </p></reply>

Proposals considered by the Working Group have been aimed at facilitating short-term letting of accommodation within permanent residences, known as homesharing, while protecting the existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand.</p>  <p>  Having considered the Group's report as well as the recommendations in the Oireachtas Committee's report on short-term lettings, I recently announced plans to introduce a &ldquo;one host, one home&rdquo; model in areas where there is high housing demand. </p>  <p>  Homesharing will continue to be permissible for a person&rsquo;s primary residence, and such home-sharers will have to register with their local authority.  An annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out, on a short-term basis, i.e. for 14 days or less at a time, of a person&rsquo;s entire home where it is their primary residence.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it as a Short Term Letting (STL), they will require planning permission to do so unless the property is already permitted to be used for tourism / short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to STL can be sought and it will be up to each local Planning Authority to consider applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners time to prepare for and adapt to the new arrangements.  In addition to revised draft exempted development planning regulations which have been prepared, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced to underpin and strengthen the new proposals and the drafting of these amendments is currently underway.</p>  <p>  Any unauthorised development, including breaches of the proposed exemptions, may be the subject of planning enforcement by the relevant planning authority.</p>  <p>  With regard to commercial rates, the general premise under valuation legislation (section 15 and Schedule 3 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended) is that all buildings and lands used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Lettings of private residences for residential purposes (whether houses or apartments) on either a short or longer term basis are not generally rateable by virtue of Schedule 4, paragraph 6.  </p>  <p>  Water customers are classified as domestic and non-domestic customers. Water charges no longer apply to domestic customers with the exception of legal provision for charges in respect of excessive use.  Irish Water applies charges to non-domestic customers in accordance with a Water Charges Plan that is approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. The current definition in the Water Charges Plan is that a Non-Domestic Premises &ldquo;means a Premises in which Water Services are used for Non-Domestic Purposes, defined in the Water Services Act 2007 as (a) agriculture or horticulture, (b) any trade, industry or business, (c) any purpose incidental to a household or private garden if the water is drawn otherwise than from a tap inside the household or if a hosepipe or other similar apparatus is used, (d) central heating other than the central heating of a household; (e) apparatus depending while in use upon a supply of continuously running water, not being an apparatus used solely for heating water.&rdquo;   In accordance with current policy applied by Irish Water, all water in relation to the provision of short term accommodation in B&amp;Bs, hotels and self-catering accommodation may be subject to a charge.</p>  <p>  These matters will be addressed further once the draft regulations are finalised.</p></reply>

In addition, the NPF represents a long-term strategy for Government Departments, State agencies, State-owned enterprises, regional and local authorities and others to support communities to achieve their potential for economic, social and infrastructural development through a shared set of strategic objectives and key principles.</p>  <p>  As a strategic document, the NPF is currently being given further and more detailed expression at the regional level through preparation, by the Regional Assemblies, of statutory Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) for the three Regional Assembly areas. </p>  <p>  The RSES process formally commenced earlier this year and the draft Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly RSES, which includes Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, was approved by the Regional Assembly on 26 October.  It sets out a strategy for the period to 2031.  It was published for public consultation on 5 November and is on public display until 23 January 2019. </p>  <p>  Both the National Planning Framework and the draft Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) for the Eastern and Midland area target significant population and housing growth in Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  In all cases, growth is projected at above national average levels to 2031.  </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that there will be 100,000 additional people living in these three counties by 2031.  The three local authorities are also required to plan for 127,000 people more during that time, to account for the fact that there will need to be permissions in place and housing under construction during the latter years of the period as there is now, in order to ensure that growth beyond 2031 can continue to be accommodated.  </p>  <p>  This means that County Development Plans in the three counties must make combined planning provision for an additional 127,000 people to 2031, which is considered to be a sustainable level of development, that will allow the provision of infrastructure and services to keep pace with housing development.  Where this level of future population and housing growth is to be located and how it will be prioritised within counties, will be a matter for the local authorities to determine through their County Development Plans.  In that context, they will be required to take into account where investment in jobs, services and infrastructure has taken place and can be provided in the future.  </p>  <p>  Good planning will include consideration of each county&rsquo;s towns and smaller settlements, many of which grew rapidly in the recent past and for which a continuation of similar levels of growth would be unsustainable.  More sustainable planning will include a significant focus on employment and access to employment, as well as the &lsquo;catch-up&rsquo; provision of facilities, where most needed, rather than on housing development simply for the sake of development alone. </p>  <p>  The two other draft RSESs (for the Northern and Western Regional Assembly and Southern Regional Assembly areas), subject to Regional Assembly approval, are expected to be put on public display in the coming weeks.  The finalisation of all three regional strategies in the first half of 2019 will in turn prompt reviews and updates of individual county and city development plans to ensure strategic co-ordination and consistency between national, regional and local levels.</p></reply>

The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the range of complex issues which need to be addressed, with a particular focus on increasing and accelerating housing delivery, across all tenures. The Plan is underpinned by over &euro;6 billion in funding to support the delivery of over 50,000 new social housing homes and some 87,000 other housing supports over the 6 years 2016 to 2021.</p><p>Significant progress has been made in 2016 and 2017, in partnership with local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and a range of other delivery partners, with over 45,000 individuals and families having their housing needs met during those 2 years, and a further 25,500 households expected to be supported this year. The level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 22%, from 91,600 households to 71,858, between 2016 and 2018. In Wexford, the number of households on waiting lists has reduced by more than 15% from 2,577 in 2017 to 2,177 in 2018.</p><p>Wexford County Council, and the Approved Housing Bodies it is working with, have a social housing construction programme of 52 projects either already complete or at planning, design, tender or construction stage, which will deliver 605 homes. </p><p>My Department continues to engage actively with all local authorities, including Wexford County Council, to deliver social housing through all available avenues, with a particular emphasis on additional construction projects.</p><p>In relation to the rental sector, section 24A of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2016 provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to the Minister that an area should be considered for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone.  Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. There is no provision for any other type of area to be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone.</p><p>For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) the annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and </p><p>(ii) the average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,094 per month in Q2 2018).</p><p>The RTB Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This allows everyone to see exactly where their area stands in relation to average rent levels and increases and possible designation.  </p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at  by searching 'rent pressure zones - information'.</p><p>The data from the Rent Index Report for Q2 2018 relating to the local electoral area of Gorey, County Wexford is detailed in the table below:  <table><tr><th>Local Electoral Area</th><th>Quarters &amp;gt; 7%</th><th>Average 2018 Q2</th></tr><tr><td>Gorey</td><td>4</td><td>&euro;847.01</td></tr></table></p><p>In Gorey, while in 4 of the last 6 quarters rent inflation has been 7% or greater, the average monthly rent is below the national standardised rent of &euro;1,094 per month. Therefore, the Local Electoral Area of Gorey does not meet the criteria for designation at this time.</p><p>The Housing Agency continues to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 14,930 homes.</p>  <p>  Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process will be included in a report on the initiative that it is intended to publish shortly. The publication of the NTICI report will be of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot programme in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge, including through coordination with capital works by Irish Water.  In addition, the National Development Plan includes a provision of &euro;31 million for DPI in the period 2018-2021, demonstrating the Government's commitment to transition from the pilot phase under NTICI to a programme phase.</p>  <p>  My Department intends to write to local authorities to advise them of the future funding arrangements for DPI-type housing estates that are not taken in charge, following the publication, shortly, of the review report on the 2016 NTICI.</p></reply>

In addition, the NPF represents a long-term strategy for Government Departments, State agencies, State-owned enterprises, regional and local authorities and others to support communities to achieve their potential for economic, social and infrastructural development through a shared set of strategic objectives and key principles.</p>  <p>  As a strategic document, the NPF is currently being given further and more detailed expression at the regional level through preparation, by the Regional Assemblies, of statutory Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) for the three Regional Assembly areas.</p>  <p>  The RSES process formally commenced earlier this year.  The draft Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly RSES is now on public display for consultation until Wednesday 23 January 2019. The draft RSES, which contains information in relation to plans for County Kildare, is available on the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly's website at the following link: www.emra.ie/rses.</p>  <p>  The two other draft RSESs (Northern and Western Regional Assembly and Southern Regional Assembly), subject to Regional Assembly approval, are expected to be put on public display in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The finalisation of these regional strategies in the first half of 2019 will in turn prompt reviews and updates of individual county and city development plans to ensure strategic co-ordination and consistency between national, regional and local levels, including County Kildare.</p></reply>

The phased nature of the HAP rollout has allowed for significant learning, with new HAP authorities benefitting from the experience of those authorities where the scheme had been previously operational.</p><p>At the end of Quarter 2 2018, over 37,750 tenancies were being supported by the HAP scheme, including over 9,000 additional households in 2018, with an average weekly set up of 350 tenancies. There are now 21,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.</p><p>A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) recipient. However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are in receipt of certain housing related payments, including HAP. If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), a tenant sources their own accommodation. The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended). The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned. </p><p>Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis. </p><p>At the end of Q2 2018, 21.3% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility (excluding those households accommodated through the homeless HAP arrangements in Dublin). In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 15.7%<b></b>above rent limits provided. </p><p>The data available to my Department indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.</p><p>The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies. The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 3,000 households being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme at end Q2 2018.  The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is now available to each of the 31 local authorities, with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme.</p><p>I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting current housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters, including determination of relevant property under the Acts for the purposes of rates. As Minister, I have no function in relation to decisions in this regard. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  </p>  <p>  The Valuation Act 2001, as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.  Included in the exemptions under Schedule 4 are properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis, and properties that only provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme.  In general, the Acts maintain the long-standing position that all properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable, including all private childcare facilities.  There are no proposals under consideration for a discount of commercial rates for childcare service providers in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner of Valuation, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4. As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Acts as they relate to pre-school childcare facilities and all other categories of properties.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Acts. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation.  If the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. Also, there is a right of appeal to the Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

Part 2 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 put in place a new procedure for securing possession of local authority housing involving a hearing of the merits in the District Court in disputed cases. It also provides local authorities with power to secure court orders excluding individuals engaged in anti-social behaviour from local authority housing and estates.      </p>  <p>  Sections 6 to 12 of the 2014 Act set down revised procedures for housing authorities to deal with serious breaches of the tenancy agreements for their dwellings, including anti-social behaviour.  The Council may issue a tenancy warning in relation to a breach (sections 7 to 9) and the tenant may seek an internal review of the issue of the warning (sections 10 and 11).  Where the breach of the tenancy agreement continues or is repeated, the Council may seek a possession order in the District Court, which will adjudicate on the merits of the proposed recovery where the tenant disputes the grounds for it (section 12).  Recovery of possession by the housing authority has the effect of terminating the tenancy in the dwelling.  Any party to a possession application may appeal the District Court&rsquo;s decision to the Circuit Court.</p></reply>

While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's interest and exposure.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, rented accommodation. </p>  <p>  In relation to the recent purchase of the apartments in question by an investment company, it is important to remember that the priority is to ensure an increase in the overall supply of new homes  whether available to purchase or rent.  Given the highlighted lack of properties available to rent in the Dublin area, increased rental supply is welcome.</p>  <p>  Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects, provides more stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility. Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Large-scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector that tenants deserve.</p>  <p>  The fact that institutional investors are entering the rental market, with a clear long-term focus on their investment provides security for tenants who can be confident that their landlord is committed for the long run.  </p>  <p>  A number of additional tenancy protection measures were introduced in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 to enhance tenants&rsquo; security, including:</p>  <p>  - The abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to end that tenancy for no stated ground;</p>  <p>  - The extension of the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years; and</p>  <p>  - Protection for existing tenants to remain in situ where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or more units within a single development at the same time, other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  These provisions apply to all apartments which are the subject of a tenancy within the meaning of the Residential Tenancies Acts.</p></reply>

The legislative framework comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000 (the Act), as amended, and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.  </p>  <p>  With regards to policy guidance, my Department has issued a large number of planning guidelines (available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.housing.gov.ie) under section 28 of the Act, to which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard in the exercise of their planning functions.  The day-to-day operation of the planning system is, however, a matter for the planning authorities.  </p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority which can take action if a development does not have the required permission or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers under the Act in this regard.  A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice in connection with an unauthorised development, requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a court order under section 160 of the Act requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  Indeed, section 160 of the Act provides that anyone may seek a court order in relation to unauthorised development; such action is not restricted to planning authorities.</p>  <p>  While my Department keeps planning legislation under regular review, I am satisfied that planning authorities have sufficient enforcement powers at their disposal under the existing legislation and  I have no plans to amend the provisions at this time.</p></reply>

At end Q2 2018, the total numbers of active HAP tenancies in those areas were 1,148 in Galway City and 842 in Galway County.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland sets annual national targets for additional HAP-supported tenancies. A target was set to support an additional 17,000 households through HAP in 2018 and, at end Q2, an additional 9,083 HAP tenancies had been set up.</p><p>Individual weekly targets were set for all local authorities in order to ensure delivery of the annual HAP targets set nationally under Rebuilding Ireland and to allow for the appropriate and orderly financial planning of the exchequer allocation to the scheme.  The table below sets out the weekly HAP targets for Galway City and County Councils for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Galway City Weekly HAP Target</th><th>Galway County Weekly HAP Target</th></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>14 </td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>15 </td><td>10 </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>5 </td><td>8 </td></tr></table></p><p>HAP is replacing Rent Supplement (RS) for those with a long term housing need who qualify for social housing support. However, RS will remain available through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) to households as a short-term income support. </p><p>Individuals with a housing need, who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work, as they would lose their RS support, can now move to HAP and avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent. The strategic aim is to complete the transfers from long term rent supplement to HAP by 2020, as outlined in Rebuilding Ireland.  </p><p>The table below sets out for Galway City and County Councils:</p><p>- the number of new 2018 HAP tenancies set up at end Q2; </p><p>- the number of these tenancies that are transfers from RS; and </p><p>- the percentage of new 2018 HAP tenancies to end Q2 that were transfers from RS.<table><tr><th>Local Authority Area</th><th>2018 HAP Tenancies Set-up</th><th>2018 RS Transfer Set-ups</th><th>2018 RS Transfer %</th></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council </td><td>274 </td><td>93 </td><td>34% </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td>163 </td><td>29 </td><td>18% </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The absence of the Executive also means that the North South Ministerial Council cannot meet.</p>  <p>  I am currently engaging with Secretary of State Bradley on how both Governments can most effectively secure the full operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I met with Secretary of State Bradley in Dublin on 17 September, in Belfast on 8 October and most recently in Dublin on 2 November at the British Irish Inter-Governmental Conference.  We spoke by phone on Monday 12 November.</p>  <p>  Both Governments are continuing to engage with all of the political parties to seek a way forward to get the Institutions up and running again.  All parties have re-affirmed their commitment to operating the devolved institutions and have provided views on their key concerns and issues. </p>  <p>  In the period ahead, I believe a new political process is required to get beyond the current impasse and secure the necessary agreement between the parties on operating the devolved institutions again.</p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving that, but I firmly believe that a resolution is possible and that the calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate will be heeded.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of the institutions of the Agreement.</p></reply>

These Divisions have been established as part of Revenue&rsquo;s decision, in the overall context of risk, to realign its resources to give a better focus on and response to risk in line with Revenue&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2017-2019. The compliance work of each of the aforementioned Divisions is risk based and the capacity and capability of each Divisions is related, inter alia, to a range of factors including the complexity of the cases. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the HWI Division is, in general, responsible for the tax affairs of individuals with a net worth of c. &euro;50m, for tax avoidance and for pensions.  In relation to individuals, the MED is responsible for the tier of high wealth individuals, just below the case base of the HWI Division.  The criteria used to identify individuals for inclusion in the MED is a combination of wealth, income, and risk indicators.</p>  <p>  Both Divisions monitor the tax affairs of their case base through risk assessment and evaluation programmes that are supported by data analytics and by the interrogation of both taxpayer and third-party information.  In line with Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to managing compliance the appropriate intervention is undertaken following appraisal of the risk factors in each case. The substantive difference in the two Divisions is the taxpayer case base for which they have responsibility.</p>  <p>  I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s structural realignment is supported by an expansion in the number of specialist and experienced staff assigned to the oversight of the case base in each of the two new Divisions.  This includes staff with backgrounds in the tax, accounting and legal professions. By the end of 2018 the staffing of the HWI Division will be c.100 and the staffing of the MED will be c.380. Staff are assigned to Divisions where their skills can be matched to the requirements of the role. </p>  <p>  Revenue operates within a legislative framework that applies to the overall customer base. Revenue powers are exercised by appropriately authorised Revenue officials subject to compliance with the relevant governance procedures in place. </p>  <p>  The threshold within which cases are managed by the different Divisions in Revenue are an administrative matter for Revenue for high wealth individuals and are not set out in legislation. </p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that the Large Cases Division case base reviews in 2007 and in 2015 were part of Revenue&rsquo;s normal procedural reviews.  Having regard to risk assessment of the case base, Revenue&rsquo;s existing oversight of the case base at that time and Revenue&rsquo;s overall strategic priorities, the decisions made at the time was not to adjust the threshold for high wealth individuals for which LCD was responsible.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue operates its risk, compliance and service functions independently from Ministerial direction. I have been supportive of Revenue proposals with regard to additional resources in the context of the last three budgets and estimates campaigns. I will carefully consider any further requests for additional resources.</p></reply>

This process began on 25 April 2018 and involved a number of Government Departments and public bodies, including the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authority representatives. The misuse of scramblers in public parks was a particular point of focus. </p>  <p>  Following these consultations, a number of relevant pieces of legislation were brought to the attention of the Office of the Attorney General by my Department, to determine whether any legislative amendments were necessary to assist in curbing activity insofar as scramblers and quad bikes are concerned, without giving rise to any unintended negative legislative consequences. </p>  <p>  My Department received formal legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General last week. The advice is comprehensive in nature and is now being carefully considered by my officials, together with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the context of road traffic legislation. It will also be necessary to consult again with other relevant Government Departments and public bodies via the cross-agency forum established by my Department. The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to provide any further details in relation to the legal advice until such time as these consultations are concluded.  </p>  <p>  My officials participate in a Taskforce established by South Dublin County Council to consider the public order implications of the misuse of these off-road vehicles at a community level. The Taskforce has met on two occasions to date and is scheduled to meet again this afternoon. The Taskforce is a useful and important forum and, indeed, Taskforce discussions informed the Department&rsquo;s correspondence with the Office of the Attorney General. </p>  <p>  Arising from the Taskforce meetings, the road safety officers from each of the Dublin-based local authorities have agreed to organise a public awareness campaign, urging parents not to purchase scramblers and quad bikes as Christmas presents for minors. In addition, the Road Safety Authority has agreed to bring forward a similar safety campaign.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to closely monitor the consultations that are taking place concerning the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes and will update the Deputy in due course in this regard.</p></reply>

The numbers of the cases on hands will always include a cohort of cases where a decision has been made and the applicant has been notified of same, but where the applicant has yet to swear their oath of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State and be granted their certificate of naturalisation at a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose.  In this context in excess of 3,000 of the cases on hand have already received their decision and my Department is currently issuing invitations to these individuals to attend a citizenship ceremony on 26 November next to make their declaration before a judge and to be granted their certificate of naturalisation.</p><p>It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  While INIS endeavours that most straightforward cases are processed to a decision within six months, this target has to be seen in the context of the work involved in dealing with volumes of applications, some of which can be very complex in nature, and the need to ensure that each applicant fulfils the statutory conditions for naturalisation. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  As outlined, even where a decision may be made, the certificate cannot be issued until the applicant attends a citizenship ceremony arranged for the purpose of swearing the oath of allegiance before a judge.  In the circumstances it is not possible to give any meaningful average processing time per application.</p><p>Processing timescales can often be impacted due to further documentation being required from the applicant, or payment of the required certificate fee being awaited, or the applicant not engaging with the office.  In some instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application, for example, where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.  In other instances issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered before a final decision is taken.  </p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.</p><p>INIS devotes a considerable amount of its overall resources to the processing of these cases. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants to enable queries to be dealt with, including the progress of their application. Details are available on the INIS website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i></p></reply>

Each case is addressed on the basis of its individual circumstances.  While applications are processed with the minimum of formality compared to court proceedings, in making their decisions Tribunal members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation submitted is in order e.g. Garda reports arising from the related criminal investigation, vouched receipts for expenses, medical reports.  Accordingly, the processing time for each case can vary considerably.  </p>  <p>   I understand that the Tribunal will shortly be writing to the applicant with an update on their application.</p></reply>

The Bill completed Second Stage and was referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality on 9 November 2017. </p>  <p>  I indicated during the Second Stage debate that research was needed to develop our understanding of discrimination where it takes place on a socio-economic basis and to inform how a provision should be framed if it proves necessary to amend the equality legislation accordingly.   </p>  <p>  In June 2018, a Request For Tender (RFT) for research on adding socio-economic status as an additional ground in the equality legislation was issued.  Unfortunately, no tenders were received at that time.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has again issued the request for tender on 6 November inviting tenders from researchers to carry out this research.  A deadline has been set for completion of the research by 7 January 2019 to enable the Government to have the research ready for consideration by the Oireachtas during its next session.  </p>  <p>  The research is intended to have the following objectives:</p>  <p>  -  To provide an evidence base to enable the Government to determine whether or not the inclusion of an additional discriminatory ground into the equality legislation would be an effective and proportionate remedy to issues potentially arising in relation to discrimination against those experiencing socio-economic disadvantage.  </p>  <p>  -  To inform the Government of expert advice on the legal implications of adding such an additional discriminatory ground into the equality legislation, on how it might be defined and on the steps that might be taken to ensure its workability, having regard to the fields to which equality legislation currently applies and the exemptions contained therein. </p>  <p>  -  To advise the Government from a legal perspective as to the preferred formulation of an additional discriminatory ground if the Government were to determine that such needed to be added to the equality legislation.</p></reply>

There are socially excluded groups who experience extreme health inequalities.  Such groups include Travellers homeless people, refugees and asylum seekers and people with addiction issues.  Inequalities in health are reflected in the mortality and morbidity rates of the population.  Rates of chronic diseases are another indicator of health inequalities.  A social gradient is also apparent in mental health. Reducing health inequalities can delivery real benefits for society and for future generations. It requires interventions to address the social determinants of health and to provide integrated and comprehensive healthcare services.</p>  <p>  The health needs of Travellers' are documented in the landmark All Ireland Traveller Health Study, published in 2010 and funded by the Department of Health.  </p>  <p>  - The Department of Health, through the HSE, provides funding in the region of &euro;10m per annum for programmes to improve the health situation for Traveller communities. These include:</p>  <p>  - primary healthcare projects, counselling services, family support programmes and men's health projects; dedicated public health nurses and related staff; and </p>  <p>  - mental health promotion and suicide prevention services in a culturally sensitive manner, to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.  </p>  <p>  A further &euro;500,000 funding is provided through the Dormant Accounts Fund for initiatives aimed at improving Traveller mental health.  </p>  <p>  The Department recently convened a workshop on Traveller health needs.  This involved representation from various policy units in the Department of Health, Community Healthcare Organisations within the HSE and Traveller organisations.  </p>  <p>  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) has over 30 actions to address the health needs of Travellers and Roma. It includes an action by the HSE to develop and implement a detailed action plan, based on the findings of the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, 2010, to continue to address the specific health needs of Travellers, using a social determinants approach.    </p>  <p>  I understand a draft of the action plan is being finalised by the HSE and look forward to considering it in due course. Any proposal from the HSE for a planning advisory body for Traveller health, which might include representation from the Department of Health, will also be considered. </p></reply>

Following  consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time. A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

The HSE is required to conduct an assessment of an individual's financial circumstances to determine if an individual meets the eligibility requirements before a  medical card may be granted.  The medical card therefore will only come into effect from the date of approval by the HSE.  It should be noted that where particular medical costs arise in advance of any medical card being issued other supports are available to individuals to assist in the cost of medical care. If an individual has registered for the Drugs Payment Scheme he/she will only be required to pay for medication costs up to the value of &euro;134 per month.  In addition tax relief on medical expenses that an individual pays for oneself or on behalf of any other person may also be claimed. </p>  <p>  It is noted that the HSE can in very particular circumstances issue an emergency medical card for persons in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter  which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With  the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are followed up with a full application within a  number of weeks.</p></reply>

Noting that the Deputy has requested, in effect, that the unanalysed data be provided, the interpretation of such data would not be clear. The requirement for analysis reflects the complexities involved. For example, some women may have had multiple smears, not necessarily read in the same lab; slides may have changed by one grade or multiple grades which is a complexity that would not be shown by a simple breakdown across labs; labs dealt with different regional populations; in the early years of the programme, it was dealing with an unscreened population which is a further complexity. </p>  <p>  Once again we wish to emphasise there is in no way any intention to withhold this information.  Following significant efforts, appropriate expertise has been sought to ensure that the necessary analysis can be done such that it is anticipated the information sought by the Deputy will be available by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  In the broader context in which this data is sought, it is important to reiterate that Dr Scally is clear in his report that the Inquiry is satisfied with the quality management processes in the laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck. As previously outlined to the Deputy, it would be expected that false negatives would have occurred in all laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck since its inception.  It is important to emphasise that false negatives are not automatically negligence, and indeed that they are unavoidable in any cervical screening programme. As stated by Judge Meenan in his recently published report, smear tests are a screening test, not a diagnostic process. A significant number of smears will be reported as showing no abnormalities despite there being possible abnormalities present. This does not, of itself, amount to negligence on the part of the person(s) reading the smear. However, &ldquo;missed&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;. However, &ldquo;missed&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  In relation to the 18 month query, the HSE have advised that there was never a criteria in place whereby smears taken less than 18 months from diagnosis were excluded from review. The slides identified for further review were reviewed from a minimum of 1 month prior to diagnosis to up to 78 months prior to diagnosis. The HSE further advise that the Director General has written to Dr Gabriel Scally to provide clarity on this matter and that Dr Scally has welcomed the clarification and published correspondence in this regard on the website of the Scoping Inquiry.</p></reply>

This Act was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act. Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contain provisions relating to the regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures carried out in the State, including dealing with the rights of children born as a result of those procedures. There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3, including the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act. It is my intention that Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act will be commenced as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  A number of sections of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for the registration and re-registration of the birth of a donor-conceived child. Commencement of Part 9 of the Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality in consultation with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. However, a number of these sections have to be amended and have yet to be commenced. Commencement of these provisions is also dependent on commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act. </p>  <p>  Officials from the General Register Office, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, and the Department of Health are working together to ensure that the appropriate regulatory and operational mechanisms are in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all of the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registration of donor-conceived children.</p></reply>

Due to increased referral rates to the symptomatic breast disease clinic, as well as to the 'family risk' clinic, the hospital is currently prioritising the symptomatic patients to ensure that a quality, timely and sustainable service is available to them.

Shortly thereafter all the recently planted ash trees on that site were destroyed under Departmental supervision. The ash trees on another 10 sites where trees from the same batch of imported plants were planted out (approximately 33,000 plants in total) were also destroyed.</p>  <p>  In March 2013 the Department, continuing its efforts to attempt to prevent the spread of the disease, introduced a Reconstitution Scheme (Chalara Ash Dieback) to remove infected ash and restore forest areas planted under the afforestation scheme which had suffered from or which were associated with plants affected by disease. These findings of infected plantations continued to increase, as ash dieback disease was found over much of the country.  In April 2018 Minister of State Doyle announced a Review of the National Response to ash dieback disease as it became increasingly evident from continued findings supported by the latest scientific advice that eradication of ash dieback disease is no longer feasible. Given this position, the Department has taken the view that its policy response must also change to one of living with the disease. While the Reconstitution Scheme is no longer available as it is under review, forest owners affected by ash dieback disease can avail of support under the Woodland Improvement Scheme. The review of the Reconstitution Scheme is nearing completion and the results of that review and the consequent approach in terms of management of the disease going forward will be available in the near future.</p>  <p>  My Department has organised various information events since ash dieback disease was first identified in October 2012 including an All Ireland Chalara Conference and nationwide public meetings. Advice continues to be provided by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectors to foresters in the public and private sectors on the biology of the disease and recognition of symptoms as well as on the procedures around the clearance of affected forest plantations and infected nursery stock. Inspectors also regularly provide briefings for or attend information meetings for landowners and other relevant stakeholders and representative groups such as the IFA, the GAA, and the Ash Society.</p>  <p>  The origins of ash dieback disease are not certain but scientists have suggested the disease may have been introduced to Europe from eastern Asia.  The fungus which causes the disease has a complex life cycle. Infection first makes its way into a tree when the spores of the fungus are carried in the air and land on healthy leaves over the summer months. The fungus then grows into the leaves and down into the leaf petiole or rachis, and progressively into twigs, branches, and the stem.</p>  <p>  Where the disease is already present in a locality further local spread is likely to be caused by spores borne on the wind, each year travelling many kilometres from the original source. There is also a risk of introducing the disease into a locality where it is not yet present (and where that locality is at a considerable distance from an existing source of infection) by bringing already diseased ash seeds or plants into that area for the first time.</p>  <p>  There are a number of simple and practical steps which can help avoid the further spread of the disease. For example before leaving a forest where ash trees are present, landowners and other visitors are advised to remove all plant debris such as leaves etc. from clothing and footwear. Plant material should not be removed from such sites and where the presence of the disease is suspected, and the following hygiene measures should be observed:</p>  <p>  - Footwear: Wash off all plant and soil debris from boots. Spray your boots with disinfectant and dispose of any used water onto an area where the water will not run into a watercourse.</p>  <p>  - Clothing: Check all clothing for any plant material.</p>  <p>  - Tools &amp;amp; equipment: Wash off all plant and soil debris and apply disinfectant afterwards. Dispose of any used water onto an area where it cannot enter a watercourse.</p></reply>

Harmful organisms may be associated with a variety of internationally traded plants, plant products including wood and wood packaging material such as crates and pallets which can be associated with goods of any kind. In order to address this potential threat of introduction of a harmful organism in this manner and to protect the health of Ireland&rsquo;s forest resource there is comprehensive legislation in place, specified in the EU Plant Health Directive, (Council Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community) which describes inter alia particular import requirements for a range of commodities from origins where the presence of harmful forest pests and disease is known to occur.</p>  <p>  The aim of the legislation is to protect the national forest estate against the introduction and spread of exotic forest pest and disease threats, through the implementation of import controls. Import controls relate to a variety of forest plants, wood and wood products and wood packaging material (which may be associated with goods of any kind). Wood products subject to import control by my Department include sawn wood, roundwood logs, fire wood and wood chip for biomass. Wood packaging material controls are largely targeted at products considered to pose a high plant health risk such as cut stone.</p>  <p>  In addition to import controls, my Department carries out forest health surveys for a variety of harmful organisms including a range of Protected Zone pests and other organisms regulated on an EU wide basis in forests and forest nurseries throughout the country. Within the context of the requirements of the EU Plant Health Directive, disease management policy is determined following the outcome of further surveys to confirm the extent of a disease and consultation around best practice in dealing with this disease.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work carried out by the Department, forest owners, forest nursery staff, and members of the public are asked to be vigilant for disease and report (with photographs, if possible) any sites where there are concerns about unusual ill health.</p>  <p>  Specifically in terms of ash dieback my Department has  organised various information events since the  disease was first identified in October 2012 including an All Ireland Chalara Conference and nationwide public meetings. Advice continues to be provided by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors to foresters in the public and private sectors on the biology of the disease and recognition of symptoms as well as on the procedures around the clearance of affected forest plantations and infected nursery stock. Inspectors also regularly provide briefings for or attend information meetings for landowners and other relevant stakeholders and representative groups such as the IFA, the GAA, and the Ash Society. A Reconstitution Scheme, which is currently under review, was introduced by my Department in March, 2013 to remove infected ash and restore forest areas planted under the afforestation scheme which had suffered from or which were associated with plants affected by disease.  While the Reconstitution Scheme is no longer available as it is under review, forest owners affected by ash dieback disease can avail of support under the Woodland Improvement Scheme.

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, in the same manner as other proposed developments, with planning applications made to the relevant local planning authority and with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Within the wider national and local planning context, planning authorities must make their decisions, based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications. </p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments, the matter is being kept  under review, in consultation with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, who leads on renewable energy policy.   Our two Departments are exploring the potential for enhancing national planning guidance on solar energy, taking account of solar energy projects being assessed by planning authorities and the scope for future development of the sector in the context of the ongoing development of renewable energy policy.  </p>  <p>  On foot of this on-going engagement between the two Departments, where the need for specific planning guidance for solar farms is identified, my Department will develop such guidance as appropriate.</p></reply>

As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. </p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.   Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced in the coming weeks, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in early 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.

The nature of the problem related to the crumbling of the concrete blockwork in the external walls of affected dwellings, thereby compromising their structural integrity and giving rise to considerable personal distress to the many homeowners involved. At that time, several hundred homes were suspected to be affected in north Donegal. The presence of muscovite mica in abundant quantities in the aggregate constituent of the concrete blocks was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks.</p>  <p>  By the end of 2013, similar problems had also come to light in both public and private dwellings located in west Mayo and Mayo County Council submitted a report to my Department on problems that had been identified with the concrete blockwork in their social housing stock. In this instance, it was the presence of pyrite in the aggregate constituent of the concrete block that was suggested as being one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the concrete blocks. The emergence of similar problems among private households located in County Mayo was also reported in 2013.</p>  <p>  Over the course of 2014 and 2015, there were significant representations, media reports and letters from affected homeowners illustrating the increasing scale of the problems emerging in the two counties, the progressive nature of the external wall cracking and the resultant structural distress in the affected properties.</p>  <p>  An Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks was established by my Department in 2016 and its terms of reference were limited to the investigation of the problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in Counties Donegal and Mayo.</p>  <p>  Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  Work is underway in my Department on the development of such a scheme, including discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding and taking into account all considerations.  It is intended to revert to Government with proposals for the scheme by the end of the year, with a view to publishing details of the scheme as soon as possible thereafter.</p>  <p>  A standardised protocol is currently being developed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), which can be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite and it will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all such affected properties. It is expected that the standardised protocol will be published in the coming weeks and can be used by home owners anywhere in the country.</p>  <p>  Neither my Department nor the NSAI are aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Those listed as &quot;SHIP Construction&quot; are new build schemes taken forward by local authorities, usually on sites they own or have acquired. In most cases, the local authority will have procured a design team externally and in all cases, will contract the construction of the new social homes to private developers. &quot;SHIP Turnkey&quot; projects are separately identified in the report and are construction schemes where local authorities contract private developers to construct new housing, usually taking advantage of designs - which are fully building regulation compliant - and planning permissions that are already in place. </p><p>The most recent construction status report reflects an increase in the scale of the social housing build programme, with 1,067 schemes (or phases of schemes) in place, delivering 16,351 homes. Of this total, 3,518 homes have already been delivered during 2016, 2017 and up to Q2 2018, while a further 4,602 have started on site and are under construction. Almost 1,600 are at the final pre-construction stage and the remainder are progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement.  The projects are individually listed in the report and include the current position on each project, including those that have started on site this year.</p><p>In relation to infrastructure, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development can take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand. Approval was given for 30 projects under LIHAF in 2017 and early 2018, and these projects will stimulate development of approximately 20,000 homes across 14 local authorities, at a cost of approximately &euro;195 million, of which around 75% will be provided from exchequer funding. Kildare County Council has been approved for funding for three LIHAF projects at Sallins, Naas and Maynooth, at a total cost of &euro;21.4 million.</p></reply>

The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p>  <p>  A first call for proposals under the Fund issued to the four Dublin local authorities, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth and Cork County Councils, and Cork and Galway City Councils.  Fifteen proposals were received, from nine of the local authorities targeted under this first call and I expect to announce funding decisions in relation to these applications shortly. I expect  infrastructure works on approved projects to begin as soon as possible thereafter and delivery of affordable homes from late 2019/early 2020 onwards.</p>  <p>  More broadly, all local authorities are carrying out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. My Department hosted a workshop for local authorities last week to discuss these issues. </p>  <p>  A second call for proposals under the Fund will be made shortly. The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned assessments, which they have been requested to submit by 30 November. </p>  <p>  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, for example, under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out further. The Regulations to support the operation of Part 5 will be finalised shortly. </p>  <p>  I also introduced a new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan to enable credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties within a suitable price range.</p>  <p>  Finally, first-time buyers can also avail of the Help-To-Buy Scheme, which is intended to  alleviate some of the challenges faced by first-time buyers in providing  the required 10% deposit of the market value of the property.</p></reply>

In this context, together with developing a significant build programme on their existing residential land bank, local authorities are also required to consider the availability of land for housing, particularly social and affordable housing, within their area of responsibility. </p><p>Given the priority of the strategic development of the local authority land bank, all local authority residential sites were mapped on the Rebuilding Ireland land map, which is available at the following link on the Rebuilding Ireland website, <i></i>.  The map includes details of over 700 local authority and Housing Agency owned sites amounting to some 1,700 hectares, and local authorities have been requested to update the map on a quarterly basis.</p><p>&euro;2.4 billion is being provided for housing in 2019 and all local authorities are encouraged to bring forward viable and appropriate development proposals, which can be funded through the range of schemes and programmes that have been put in place.  For example, as part of Budget 2019, the Government announced &euro;310 million, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), for enabling infrastructure on Council lands to facilitate affordable housing. The first call issued to local authorities in June and further calls will be made in the weeks and months ahead. </p><p>In terms of providing housing support to the most vulnerable, a strong and growing social housing construction pipeline is now in place, as evidenced in the Quarter 2 2018 Social Housing Construction Status Report. Since the end of 2016, the number of schemes and homes in the programme has doubled. Activity on-site has also increased significantly, with 1,074 homes going on-site in Q2 this year alone. The Q2 2018 Report is available at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>In order to assist local authorities further my Department hosted a workshop last week to discuss strategic land development and the delivery of affordable housing. Further bilateral engagement between local authorities and my Department will now follow with a view to progressing further social and affordable projects on council lands.  </p><p>While the development of existing local authority sites is the priority, where a local authority identifies a need to acquire additional lands, it may seek to borrow the required finance from the Housing Finance Agency. Once the site is included within the social housing construction programme my Department would then normally consider recouping the land costs and any associated loan interest charges to the local authority, as part of the social housing project approval process. </p><p>In accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, the decision to borrow is a reserved function of the elected members of the local authority concerned, who have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions and are accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  As such, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. </p><p>Section 106 of the Act also provides that local authorities must obtain the consent of the appropriate Minister to undertake borrowing. In this regard, sanction to borrow for housing land acquisition is submitted by the local authority to my Department, and sanction may be granted based on an assessment of the financial viability of potential loans insofar as individual local authorities are concerned, and an assessment as to whether the borrowing can be accommodated within the context of the fiscal rules.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports is underway. The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. </p><p>The review will obviously have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.  </p><p>Following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, on 1 February 2018, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was launched.  The new loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise be able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p><p>The income limits which are set out in the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018 state that single applicants for the loan must not be earning greater than &euro;50,000 gross per annum.  The combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 per annum.  There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with the statutory credit policy underpinning the loan.  These income limits are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings.</p><p>Full details of the loan's eligibility criteria and other information are available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website: <i></i>.  </p><p>Any person who meets the eligibility criteria may apply for a loan regardless of whether or not they are on the local authority housing list or qualified for social housing support.</p></reply>

This has led to a multi-faceted building control reform agenda, which commenced implementation in 2014 with the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.</p><p>Under these Regulations, the owner of a building must assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he/she has commissioned. They in turn, must account for their work through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates. The roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers, etc. during building works are set out in the <i>Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, </i>which is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i></i>. This has brought clarity and accountability to the roles of those involved in construction projects and a focus on compliance with Building Regulations from design through to construction. </p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. </p><p>The National Building Control Management Project (NBCMP) was set up to provide centralised oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities. Under this project, the Building Control Management System (BCMS) was developed. A Framework for Building Control Authorities was prepared to standardise work practices, a compliance support facility has been established and a training programme is being developed and rolled out. </p><p>Also, and most fundamentally, steps are in place for the continued strengthening of the inspection regime in Building Control Authorities to carry out meaningful risk-based targeted inspections of building works. Dublin City Council has been confirmed as the lead building control authority, creating a central and stable executive structure to oversee the local building control function, with regular communication and feedback between the lead authority and other local authorities.</p><p>The Government has also approved the General Scheme of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register) Bill to establish a mandatory statutory register for builders and specialist sub-contractors. The main objective of the Bill is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations within the construction sector. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist sub-contractors provides consumers with assurance that they are dealing with competent and compliant operators.  The drafting of the Bill is being progressed and while I am not in a position at this stage to give a precise indication of the timeline for the Bill's publication, my Department is working with the Attorney General's Office with a view to achieving publication in Q1 2019.  </p><p>These reforms have already brought, and, through their full implementation, will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations.</p><p>It is important, however, to note that under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. As such, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p></reply>
