    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-21a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012100055#WRA00500"><p>The Redundancy Payments Act 1967 (as amended) outlines the rights and obligations of employers and employees in relation to statutory redundancy entitlements.</p>  <p>  Section 12A of the Act is the Covid-19 emergency provision which suspends an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer following certain periods of lay-off or short time work due to Covid-19.  The decision to extend this suspension to 31st March 2021 was a difficult one to make and was disappointing for those employees who are experiencing uncertainty.  But in making this decision the Government was conscious that Quarter 1 of 2021 will be particularly difficult for many employers with ongoing closures and restrictions and we had to consider the need to ensure businesses survive and that permanent job losses and insolvency situations are avoided as much as possible.</p>  <p>  It was also considered that an extension of the end-date was important for employees to ensure that they have a continued link to their job and a pathway to return.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment will remain open until the end of March 2021 in order to support affected employees as will the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government has not made any decision on a further extension of Section 12A at this stage. In its deliberations, the Government will have regard to the criteria and principles underpinning the emergency provision, the public health and labour market situations and the social partners&rsquo; views.</p>  <p>  All other redundancy provisions remain unchanged and in force. If an employer is making employees redundant, protections such as notice periods for redundancy and the payment of a redundancy lump-sum to the affected employees still apply and the existing range of employment rights legislation remains in place.</p></reply>

Section 343 of the Act places the responsibility on every company to deliver its annual return to the Registrar of Companies on time. Under the Act, the Registrar does not have any discretion in relation to the waiving of late filing penalties.  </p><p>A company has the option of applying to the District Court for extra time to file their annual return.  The Court may, if it is satisfied that it would be just to do so, make an Order extending the time in which the annual return may be delivered to the Registrar.  Should the order be granted there would be no late filing penalties or, if applicable, no loss of audit exemption.

In addition, the new one-stage filing deadline of 56 days from a company's annual return date went live on 16th December 2020, over-hauling the previous two stage annual returns filing process.</p></reply>

For example, the maximum interest rate on loans under the scheme is 4% and there is no requirement for security on loans of up to &euro;500,000.</p><p>This scheme features a two-stage application process, whereby businesses must first apply to the SBCI to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Successful eligibility applicants are then issued an eligibility reference number which they can use to apply with a participating finance provider for loan approval. </p><p>As of Monday, 18 January 2021, the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme has had a total of 4,305 applications for eligibility to the scheme, of which 3,871 have been approved and 37 deemed ineligible. 971 loans have been sanctioned at bank level to a total value of &euro;130,310,263.</p><p>Granular details of the scheme, including the per-county breakdown of eligibility applications and draw down of loans for the COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, are reported on a quarterly basis, and so the attached document includes eligibility data and loan draw down data as of the most recent quarterly report, dated 30 September 2020. Details by county up to December 2020 are currently being compiled and will be published as soon as available. </p><p>Details on the breakdown of uptake of lending across the participating financial providers would constitute commercially sensitive information and thus has not been included in this response. </p></reply>

With this in mind, on 1st October 2020, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents. The aim of the voluntary Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. It sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together. </p>  <p>  However, this Code should not be seen in isolation. To date, over &euro;24 billion had been made available in financial support for businesses, including the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme, wage subsidies, a commercial rates holiday, low cost loans, and a VAT reduction.  The Code of Conduct and the full list of supports is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.</p></reply>

I appreciate however, that some businesses still fail to qualify for the scheme.</p>  <p>  I would note that in the recent Budget the Government has allocated significant additional resources to Departments to provide help to different sectors. This included &euro;395m provided to the Department of Transport and the &euro;222m allocated to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p>  <p>  On the examination of an alternative scheme to CRSS, I have directed my officials to engage with other relevant Departments to identify the type of businesses that fall outside of CRSS and what other sectoral aids are available. I hope to be in a position to provide a further update in the near future.</p></reply>

The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), cash for businesses, low cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities. Details of the wide range of COVID-19 schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at . </p><p>As part of Budget 2021, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), operational through Revenue, offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID of up to &euro;5,000 per week.</p><p>As a result of the fact that businesses have to close, we have made changes to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the EWSS. The new payment structure for the PUP includes the increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants.</p><p>The EWSS was also amended to align with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400. </p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. I announced the reopening of MFI lending on 31st August and I launched the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme on 7th September. </p><p>We have also announced a six-month reduction in the VAT, going down from 23% to 21%, a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% which will benefit the hospitality sector, together with a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy. </p><p>These supports are supplementary to the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 provided through the July Jobs Stimulus and other Government initiatives.</p></reply>

Further information can be found on .  The decision to move to full scale Level 5 was not taken lightly and all factors were considered. The restrictions are in place for a period of at least one month from 31 December 2020. </p><p>S.I. No. 701 of 2020 Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 10) Regulations 2020 and S.I. No. 4 of 2021 Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 10) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 () clearly sets out the temporary restrictions under Level 5. A list of essential services can be found at  and the list of essential retail outlets at Level 5 can be found at </p><p>Level 5 does not restrict people from purchasing any product, it does however restrict people from physically going into non-essential stores.  This is to stop people making unnecessary journeys, congregating and browsing for non-essential goods, to limit the spread of the virus.</p><p>Under the current temporary restrictions click and collect from non-essential retail outlets is no longer permitted. Click or phone and deliver will continue.  </p><p>We are asking retailers to fully get behind the spirit of the regulations. In particular, we are asking retailers with mixed retail offering which have discrete spaces for essential and non-essential retail to make arrangements for the separation of relevant areas. We are also asking retailers to operate staggered opening and closing hours, as well as facilitating starting and finishing hours, in order to minimise the impact on public transport and to continue to provide dedicated hours for vulnerable customers.</p><p>Retailers can and have made arrangements, on compassionate grounds, for individual customers to urgently purchase a non-essential item in store. This is only in exceptional circumstances where it is not possible to plan ahead and avail of remote ordering services such as in emergencies, e.g., admission to hospital.</p><p>My colleague Minister English has met regularly with Retail Forum members and representatives from the retail grocery and distribution sector to continuously assess adherence to the public health restrictions.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) &lsquo;The Work Safely Protocol&rsquo; incorporates the current advice on the Public Health measures needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community and workplaces. The Protocol is available on www.gov.ie The HSA is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>In addition, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) have also produced two guidance documents, one for the retail Sector and one for Shopping Centres. Both documents can be found on www.nsai.ie</p><p>I would like to thank retailers and their customers for their efforts at this difficult time. By each of us following the spirit of these new rules and working together we can hopefully return to a lower level of the Living with COVID-19 framework.</p></reply>

We are currently at Level 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan and within Level 5 people should work from home unless it is absolutely necessary to attend in person for the delivery of an essential service as listed on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority has produced detailed guidance for both employers and employees in relation to home-working on a temporary basis during COVID-19 restrictions. This guidance will help employers to understand the requirements, and steps to take, when setting up working-from-home arrangements for employees from a health and safety perspective. The guidance is available on-line at www.hsa.ie.</p>  <p>  While an employer is responsible in the first instance, for determining what work can be done remotely, employers and workers should seek to resolve any matters relating to remote working at a local level through mutual dialogue and engagement. Where this is not possible and an employee is dissatisfied, a compliant may be made to the State's workplace relations services. Advice can be obtained from the Information &amp;amp; Customer Service of the WRC at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059 9178990 or from its website www.wrc.ie.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that responsibility for health and safety at work rests with the employer whether or not that work is being done at the employee&rsquo;s home and, in this regard, work being done from home needs to be managed and coordinated to ensure that employees are not put at risk from long-term health and safety hazards.</p>  <p>  Separately, I would like to highlight the report &ldquo;Making Remote Work&rdquo; which I launched recently. This is Ireland&rsquo;s National Remote Work Strategy and sets out the path to making remote working a more permanent option in workplaces across Ireland after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed. Its actions will be progressed over the course of 2021 and includes commitments to legislate for the right to request remote working and new rules to allow employees the right to disconnect. The strategy can be viewed on my Department's website.</p></reply>

The scheme is a collaboration between my Department and the Department of Health and is jointly administered by the Health Service Executive and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Since 2016 over 1,200 homes have received free upgrades to their homes, including attic and wall insulation, window and door replacement and heating system upgrades where needed.  </p>  <p>  According to SEAI, the average cost per home completed to date is &euro;22,800. This investment has significantly improved the warmth and comfort of the homes. Initial reports have indicated that the upgrades are also delivering benefits to the health and wellbeing of participants, including reports of needing fewer GP and hospital visits. An independent analysis is being carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), in collaboration with the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  The research element of the scheme has experienced significant delays due to complications associated with GDPR, Brexit and more recently the COVID-19 emergency. </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to progress the research as quickly as possible and I will be publishing the results when they are available.  Publication is now planned for the second half of this year.

A minimum length of 20 years is generally recommended - for example, the upcoming report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will use the period 1995 - 2014 and the World Meteorological Organisations recommends 30 years.     </p>  <p>  Reference periods of 1980 - 2000 or 1980 - 2020 are commonly used both internationally and in Ireland. However, for the purposes of the GSI flood maps, with advice from Met Eireann and working with the Office of Public Works, these periods are extended forwards and backwards to capture a broader range of weather events which have impacted turloughs. As such, the reference period includes flooding that occurred within the last decade up to and including late 2019. I therefore have no plans to change the reference period. </p></reply>

The map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode.  </p>  <p>  Commercial areas defined as  BLUE on the NBP map are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard as they operate in a fully liberalised market regulated by ComReg as independent regulator.</p>  <p>  The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. </p>  <p>  I understand, however, that some homes and businesses in Blue areas on the NBP map have experienced difficulty getting a reliable high-speed broadband service and my Department is proactively engaged in dealing with any such anomalies to ensure no home or business is left behind. It remains open to the Department to bring additional premises into the National Broadband Ireland roll-out plan under the NBP contract where no commercial high-speed broadband service is available from any of the commercial operators.</p>  <p>  Of the 2.4 million premises across Ireland, 77% of premises now have access to high-speed broadband of more than 30 Mbps. National Broadband Ireland, NBI, will  address  the remaining premises through the National Broadband Plan State intervention. In many parts of the country, very high capacity networks are now becoming the norm. For example, 40% of subscriptions are for services offering speeds in excess of 100 Mbps. There are more than 225,000 fibre subscriptions across the country, representing a 55% increase on last year. </p>  <p>  A number of commercial operators  have announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband. Eir has said it will roll out fibre to a further 1.4 million premises, bringing their fibre deployment to some 1.8 million premises. SIRO is currently completing the first phase of its fibre deployment which will see 375,000 premises passed with gigabit services. Virgin Media is offering 250 Mbps as a standard offering with 500 Mbps and 1 Gbps available to many of their customers across the more than 1 million premises that they cover. Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p></reply>

EY were commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann following a competitive procurement process and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann submitted a final report to my Department in July 2020. Management and oversight of EY&rsquo;s work programme was a matter for<i></i>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in line with their contractual arrangements, including payment of any fees. </p><p>Separately my Department arranged for JASPERS, an agency of the European Union / European Investment Bank, to conduct an independent review of the proposal once the work referred to above was complete. JASPERS provides advisory services to Member States (and other public authorities in the EU) and has extensive experience in relation to transport infrastructure proposals in European regions. There were no payments made to JASPERS in respect of this work as JASPERS&rsquo; services are available to Member States.  </p><p>I am informed that there were no meetings of the type described the Deputy, viz. the former Minister and his Department meeting with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, EY or JAPSERS about preparation of the EY Report or the JASPERS Review.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, I can confirm that, following completion of the JASPERS Review, my Department and I held a virtual meeting with JASPERS. The meeting discussed the recently completed Review and also discussed the potential funding opportunities available generally at a European level to support our extensive sustainable mobility investment programme.</p><p>I can also confirm that, as is standard practice, my Department met with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and EY on two occasions during the course of their work in 2019: the first, introductory, meeting took place on 4 April shortly after Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commissioned EY, with a second meeting held on 4 July 2019 at which a general update was provided. Following submission of a draft report by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in November 2019, a third meeting was held on 24 February 2020 which focussed on an initial Departmental review of the draft report and a technical assessment of the report as an economic appraisal with reference to relevant Public Spending Code and Common Appraisal Framework guidance.</p><p>Finally, in relation to JASPERS, I can confirm that there is ongoing engagement between my Department and JASPERS as part of their provision of advisory services in relation to aspects of our sustainable mobility investment programme, and that ongoing engagement would have included discussions in relation to their work on the review of the Western Rail Corridor Phases 2 and 3.</p></reply>

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.</p>  <p>  My intention is to legislate for the use of e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government. This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general. At all times road safety is the primary concern and suitable lighting on vehicles is a requirement for all vehicle users on our roads.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. I intend to bring forward amendments to the relevant enabling primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is before the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

These standards are explained in NTA&rsquo;s (available at nationaltransport.ie) and include minimum specifications for age, size, accessibility and comfort. The primary aim of these requirements is to ensure the quality of vehicles in the SPSV sector. All SPSVs are tested for suitability before they are first licensed as SPSVs and again prior to renewal of the vehicle licence. </p><p>The following table outlines the current list of suitable electric powered SPSVs as provided by the NTA.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Battery Electric (BEV)</th>       <th></th>       <th>Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Make</td>       <td>Model </td>       <td>Make</td>       <td>Model </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nissan</td>       <td>Leaf </td>       <td>Mitsubishi</td>       <td>Outlander </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tesla</td>       <td>Model S </td>       <td>Kia</td>       <td>Niro (PHEV) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tesla</td>       <td>Model 3 </td>       <td>BMW</td>       <td>530E </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kia</td>       <td>Niro </td>       <td>Landrover</td>       <td>Range Rover (PHEV) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tesla</td>       <td>Model X </td>       <td>Mercedes</td>       <td>S500e (PHEV) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nissan</td>       <td>eNV200 Evalia </td>       <td>Volkswagen</td>       <td>Passat GTE </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>Porsche</td>       <td>Cayenne E Hybrid </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>To encourage electric vehicles (EVs) in the SPSV fleet, the Taxi Regulation (Small Public Service Vehicle Regulations 2015) provide discretion with regard to a smaller luggage space requirement for vehicles running on alternative fuels. Specific internal dimensions must still be achieved in order to meet SPSV licensing requirements; such considerations include interior leg room and sufficient space to carry a folded wheelchair. Where the interior dimensions are met, the vehicle can be licensed as an SPSV. The NTA are always looking to increase the choice of vehicles suitable for SPSV use and will continue to evaluate new EVs when they are made available on the market. </p><p>The transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles has an important role to play in effecting a substantial reduction in transport CO<sub>2</sub>and of air pollutant emissions, particularly in Irish towns and cities due to the high mileage travelled by these vehicles, the stop/start and idling nature of their work, as well as the predominance of fossil fuels within the sector. Increasing the uptake of electric vehicle (EVs) in the SPSV sector also has a strong leadership and demonstration effect on the public, introducing more people to low/zero emission mobility options. As such, I was delighted to announce the continuation and extension of the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme in 2021. Under this scheme enhanced supports, up to &euro;20,000, will be now made available for eligible taxi and hackney drivers switching to EVs. The Scheme is administered by the NTA and I expect the new Scheme Rules for 2021 to be published shortly.</p><p>In addition, several vehicle manufacturers are poised to launch new EV models in 2021, which will be evaluated by the NTA once they become available to determine their suitability as an SPSV. I expect that the combination of increasing vehicle choices, the generous purchase grants, and the roll out of dedicated recharging infrastructure will precipitate a steady greening of our SPSV fleet over the coming years.<b></b></p></reply>

The <i>Working Group </i>has considered regulatory, financial and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales from very early in the decade.</p></reply>

This programme typically supports greenways focussed on leisure and tourism albeit my intention is to ensure the better integration of such greenways with their local communities and active travel needs. </p>  <p>  Under this programme I awarded funding of &euro;150,000 to progress pre-construction planning and design into the extension of the Great Southern Greenway from Rathkeale to Patrickswell in July of 2020. I would expect an application for construction funding to follow should a feasible route be identified. At that stage it would be expected that an examination of route options between Patrickswell and Limerick City would be carried out in conjunction with the National Transport Authority (NTA).  Separately, under the same greenways programme,  I was pleased to allocate funding of &euro;2.5 million to support improvement works on the existing Great Southern Greenway from Rathkeale to the county boundary where it will link up with the section under construction near Listowel. </p>  <p>  Secondly there is the programme of urban, commuter focussed greenways in each of the five cities which is administered by the NTA. Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter I have referred your question to the NTA for a more detailed reply.

Ireland is still advocating that all EU Member States should adhere to the Green Lanes recommendation that essential transport workers should be exempt from such tests. This is in the interests of the Single Market and indeed public health by keeping supply chains open, particularly for essential goods such as food and medical supplies. </p>  <p>  However, a number of EU Member States have in recent weeks introduced testing requirements for truck drivers coming from Ireland (Netherlands, Germany, and also France, where a driver from Ireland is travelling via the UK land bridge route to enter France). France is this week considering extending to Ireland the existing requirement for Covid testing of all truck drivers entering France from the UK. My Department is in regular contact with the French authorities and has explained the difficulties involved if such testing requirements are introduced. </p>  <p>  The UK Government agreed to provide a free testing service for truck drivers, including drivers from Ireland using the UK landbridge. Ireland must now prepare for putting a similar system in place, given the importance of sustaining our supply lines at this time of emergency, particularly following the departure of our nearest geographical neighbour from the EU.</p>  <p>  Testing services for persons leaving the State are provided by the private sector for a fee and this option will remain open for drivers. All testing services for the purpose of travel are completely separate to the public health test and trace system run by the HSE.</p>  <p>  There is no requirement for truck drivers entering Ireland to undergo a Covid test.

Whereas the exit of the North bore of the Tunnel and the entrance to Dublin Port is a very short distance, meaning that any congestion within Dublin Port could have an almost immediate impact on the Dublin Tunnel. For safety reasons it is not possible to have stagnant traffic in the Dublin Tunnel, this, and the potential for Brexit-related traffic congestion at Dublin Port to impact on adjacent roads and the motorway system are the primary reasons why it was necessary to introduce a traffic management plan in Dublin. </p>  <p>Furthermore, in contrast to Dublin Port, a significant volume of traffic using Rosslare Europort is trade to/from Continental Europe, this trade avoids the new Brexit related interventions which are applicable to trade from the UK since the 1st January 2021. As a consequence, it is possible for this traffic to exit Rosslare Europort immediately without the requirement to stay in the port to undergo checks thus less likely to cause significant congestion.</p></reply>

This campaign was also supported by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Business Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>This communication campaign served to reinforce the message that there is maritime capacity available to transport goods directly to Continental Europe and that these options are many and varied across different modalities (ro-ro, con-ro, lo-lo) providing both accompanied and unaccompanied options to exporters. </p><p>We have witnessed throughout 2020 and at the beginning of 2021 an unprecedented response from the shipping industry in terms of increasing capacity to match market demand. It has occurred across all relevant modes and has drawn from all available responses. These responses include (1) utilization of surplus capacity, (2) increasing capacity by altering schedules, (3) redeploying vessels within their fleets, and (4) adding new capacity in the form of additional vessels. </p><p><b>Number of Sailings</b></p><p>As of January 2021, there are around 60 RoRo freight sailings between Ireland and the Continent in a typical week. This includes five shipping operators, Irish Ferries, Stena Line, DFDS, Brittany Ferries and CLDN offering both accompanied and unaccompanied freight. This represents an increase of around 34 sailings per week, or around 130% increase in continental RoRo frequency compared to January 2020. </p><p>Specifically in relation to sailings between Ireland and France, in January 2020, there were 12 weekly sailings to and from Northern France. These were provided by Irish Ferries and Stena Line to the port of Cherbourg (not including the seasonal service operated by Brittany Ferries to Roscoff). In the last 12 months, the number of sailings to Northern France has increased by 22. Based on published schedules, there are now over 30 sailings per week to and from the ports of Dunkerque and Cherbourg, provided by Stena Line, Irish Ferries, DFDS and Brittany Ferries. </p><p><b>Freight Capacity</b></p><p>The increase in choice and frequency in the RoRo freight market over the past year has had a very significant impact on freight capacity to continental EU ports. Weekly RoRo freight capacity to continental EU ports has doubled in the past 12 months. There is now capacity for approximately 5,000 additional HGVs &amp;amp; unaccompanied trailers on continental RoRo services per week in January 2021. </p><p>The largest increase in capacity has come on RoRo services to Northern France. In January 2020, capacity to Northern France represented 35% of all continental EU capacity. As of January 2021, it now accounts for 49%. </p><p>Unaccompanied RoRo freight is an essential component of continental RoRo capacity. In 2020, unaccompanied RoRo freight made up over 80%<b></b>of all continental RoRo volume.</p><p><b>Details of growth in direct services</b></p><p>Details on additional capacity added on direct services since 1 January 2021 include the following:-</p><p>- On 10 December 2020, Stena Line announced an additional ship on the Rosslare to Cherbourg route, doubling their capacity and frequency of sailings from January 4th.</p><p>- Irish Ferries and Stena changed their schedules to minimise overlapping so that a daily RoRo services from Ireland to Cherbourg was provided from January 2021.</p><p>- DFDS launched a new service from Rosslare to Dunkerque from 2 January 2021. There are six weekly departures from each port with a  crossing time of 24 hours and capacity for up to 125 HGVs.</p><p>- CldN have added a second weekly call from Cork to Zeebrugge to cope with the increasing demand on this route which commenced on January 8<sup>th</sup>;</p><p>- Irish Ferries swopped their larger ship, the WB Yeats, from the Dublin /Holyhead to the Dublin-Cherbourg route from January 6<sup>th</sup>, 2021, substantially increasing capacity on this route. Also, the Epsilon will operate on a temporary basis with one rotation on weekends where there is increased demand on the Dublin-Cherbourg route.</p><p>- On January 13<sup>th</sup>Stena Line announced it was swapping the Stena Horizon with their new ship the Stena Embla on the Rosslare/Cherbourg route with immediate effect.</p><p>- On January 16<sup>th</sup>Stena also announced they were commencing a new Saturday service from Dublin to Cherbourg commencing on 25<sup>th</sup>January. This will be kept under review based on demand.</p><p>- Brittany Ferries brought forward their once weekly sailing from Rosslare to Cherbourg from March 2021 to January 18<sup>th</sup>, 2021.</p><p>- New LOLO service operated by Samskip will commence on the Dublin-Amsterdam route from January 25<sup>th</sup>, 2021.</p><p>These new sailings are in addition to a number of other new services and increased sailings that came on stream over last Summer, including new RoRo services from Ireland to Zeebrugge, Santander and Portugal by CLDN.</p></reply>

I have therefore referred this part of the Question to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.   </p>  <p>  My Department is in constant contact with the Road Safety Authority since the start of the pandemic regarding all of its services, the impact of Covid-19 on those services, and how they can best be maintained in the current circumstances. </p>  <p>  Due to suspension of driver testing services in the first 2020 lockdown, along with the health protocols since resumption of service and the further curtailing of services during subsequent level 5 restrictions, a significant backlog has developed. The need to once again return to level 5 restrictions for reasons of public health will inevitably impact further on delays to driver testing. During the level 5 period, driving tests will be available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work.   </p>  <p>  While the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with the RSA, my Department has approved the hiring of a further 40 temporary testers for 22 months, and the process of recruitment is now underway. These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who I previously gave sanction to rehire during 2020. These measures will help to increase testing capacity. However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased. Any decision on this matter will be guided by health protocols as it important that the health of these essential workers be protected as much as possible.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has also had a profound effect on the delivery of the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s driver theory testing services and a significant backlog has developed.  Under current level 5 restrictions, the driver theory test has not been deemed to be an essential service. As a consequence, the service is closed while level 5 restrictions remain in place.  </p>  <p>  The driver theory test service has seen its capacity reduced significantly to comply with occupational and public health requirements. The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests while adhering to occupational and public health requirements for when servicers are resumed. In this regard, they would, for example, be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours also provided to allow additional capacity for appointments. Much like the driver testing service, it will take time for the theory test service to return to normal waiting times.</p></reply>

This is fundamentally impacting on many businesses in Ireland, including on the road haulage sector. </p>  <p>  These changes represent a considerable shock to existing supply chains and logistics arrangements. The checks and controls which are now taking place are necessary and permanent, and are required in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to the Single Market and to protect public health and food. The Government fully acknowledges that this presents significant challenges and imposes additional burdens on hauliers and on all businesses trading with Great Britain. This is evidenced by the lower than anticipated flows of goods from Great Britain to Ireland since 1 January 2021.   </p>  <p>  I am aware that the relevant agencies continue to work around the clock to ensure trade can flow to the greatest extent possible. Where difficulties have arisen for users in specific cases, the agencies are engaging directly &ndash; whether with the companies, representative organisations or individual drivers &ndash; to get the issues resolved. </p>  <p>   I am also aware that the agencies have engaged extensively with the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) and other logistics representative bodies and continue to do so. A stakeholders' forum for the Haulage and Logistics Sector, including the IRHA and FTAI, meets weekly under the Department of Transport and comprises representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture and the Marine, and the HSE.  In addition, the Departments and agencies engage with the IRHA and other representative bodies continuously on an ad hoc basis as issues arise. I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners held a technical workshop with the IRHA on Friday 15 January on the new Revenue systems.  </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners are reporting that, of the goods that are arriving in Dublin and Rosslare Ports,  the majority are being green routed and can exit the ports directly on disembarkation.  Certain goods are and will continue to be subject to documentary and physical examination and these will have be checked before being allowed to leave the port.</p>  <p>  My Department remains in contact with the haulage and logistics sector and also participates in Brexit retail and enterprise forums to monitor issues and developments in those sectors. Trade on our direct maritime services to the EU have seen a huge increase in demand since 1 January 2021, as businesses opt to move directly to EU markets and avoid the UK landbridge. While trade flows from Great Britain remain significantly lower than anticipated and while this is a matter of concern to me, we are seeing a gradual increase in the flow of goods through our ports and I expect that this will continue as businesses become more familiar with the new arrangements and as our agencies continue to work with businesses to address any difficulties arising.</p></reply>

This operates in the same manner as the existing Steel Safeguard measures which were introduced in 2018, and where the main steel supplying countries to the EU are allocated individual quotas based on their historical exports to the EU, while the other countries, known as the Rest of the World (ROW), share the remaining quota. The Steel tariff quotas are available to businesses on a &ldquo;first come first served&rdquo; basis. Where the quota is exceeded, a tariff rate of 25% is imposed. There are also some steel categories that do not benefit from a tariff quota and the tariff rate for those categories of steel is also 25%.</p>  <p>  Businesses can check the EU Commission&rsquo;s TARIC database to verify if a quota is available for goods using the product classification (CN) code and country of origin e.g. the UK. Businesses can check the EU Commission&rsquo;s Tariff Quota Consultation Database for details on the balance of quotas available at any point in time for the particular products and country of origin. To claim quota relief, the importer makes the claim on the electronic customs import declaration. If there is sufficient quota remaining, then the request is accepted by the EU TARIC system. A retrospective claim can be made after goods have been imported if enough of the quota is still available. If the claims on a quota on any day exceeds the amount of quota available, claims will be granted on a pro-rata basis. A tariff rate of 25% applies in cases where the quota is exhausted.</p>  <p>  Further information on quotas is available on the Revenue website or by contacting the Tariff Quota Section in Revenue on origin&amp;quotasection@revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The tax provisions are intended to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.  The section 110 regime enables noteholders to invest through one structured vehicle, without giving rise to an additional layer of tax as compared to a direct investment in the underlying assets.</p>  <p>  Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk and, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing.  It is accepted that having the option for more diversified sources of financing is good for investment and business.  It is also important for financial stability in the economy, as the ability to securitise loan books plays an important role in allowing banks to meet their capital requirement obligations and to continue lending to businesses and individuals. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that It is not possible to identify the amount of tax that would be raised in any given year by ending the deductibility of the items identified by the Deputy. Any such estimate would be entirely hypothetical as it is not possible to determine whether companies would still avail of section 110 status should the deductibility of such items be withdrawn. </p>  <p>  Department of Finance officials, together with officials in Revenue, continue to monitor the sector and the operation of section 110 on an ongoing basis, with a view to taking action should it be deemed necessary. For example, in 2019 Department officials prepared a report on Real Estate Investment Trusts, Irish Real Estate Funds and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market. This report was presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July 2019 and informed the amendments to the section 110 regime introduced in Finance Act 2019. These amendments strengthened the significant restrictions to the deductions which a section 110 company can claim for payment of profit participating notes to a specified person. The amendments also placed the section&rsquo;s main purpose test on an objective basis, which enables Revenue to more effectively challenge abuse of the legislation. </p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19 and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may now be in difficulty for the first time. </p>  <p>  Regarding the offering of further payment breaks, the Deputy should be aware that the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated in recent days that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19.  The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p>  <p>  Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. On 30 November last, the BPFI reported that approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% returned on reduced repayments. </p><p>The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated in recent days that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review  was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.</p><p>It should be noted that the Central Credit Register does not produce credit scores; rather the information on a credit report provided by the Central Credit Register is factual in nature and the information is provided to the Central Credit Register by lenders.  It contains no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit or repayment arrangements agreed with borrowers.  Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites. </p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support. </p></reply>

In early December 2020, and as the public health restriction at the time began to ease and businesses reopen, Revenue confirmed that the concessionary measure related to employer-provided vehicles would cease to apply on 31 December 2020 and, with effect from 1 January 2021, BIK on same should be calculated in the usual manner.  </p><p>However, since then, Level 5 public health restrictions have been subsequently introduced. On 24 December 2020, all restaurants, caf&eacute;s and gastro pubs as well as personal services, such as hairdressers, beauticians and barbers closed, while hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;amp;Bs remain open but are restricted to essential non-social and non-tourist services only. Additionally, on 31 December all non-essential retail as well as gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools closed. For employees, the public health advice is to work from home in all instances unless work is an essential health, social care or other essential service that cannot be done from home. </p><p>Having regard to the current public health restrictions Revenue confirmed in eBrief 004/2021, which issued on 14<sup>th</sup>January 2021, that the short-term concessionary measures announced back in March will remain in place. This means that, for the time being: </p><p>- Where an employer takes back possession of the vehicle and an employee has no access to the vehicle, no BIK shall apply for the period.</p><p>- Where an employee retains possession of a vehicle, but the employer prohibits the use of the vehicle, no BIK shall apply if the vehicle is not used for private use.  </p><p>Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited its use and no such use has occurred, for example communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer, etc. </p><p>Where an employee has a car provided by his or her employer and </p><p>1. the circumstances in the previous example don&rsquo;t apply,</p><p>2. limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken due to the COVID-19 crisis, <b>and</b></p><p>3. personal use is limited</p><p>the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of BIK due. Thus, the percentage applied in the calculation of the cash equivalent, which is based on annualised business mileage, may have regard to the actual business mileage for January 2020, for the current period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Appropriate records should be kept, for example business mileage travelled in January, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer etc. </p><p>Guidance on the above and other COVID-19 related matters can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website*. </p><p>Due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic it is not known how long any COVID-19 restrictions will ultimately remain in place. Revenue will however continue to regularly review all COVID-19 related matters (including the provisions relating to BIK on employer-provided vehicles) and if any further measures are considered necessary in the future, updated guidance will be made available by Revenue in relation to same as soon as possible.  </p><p>*https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/covid19/compliance-with-certain-reporting-and-filing-obligations.aspx </p></reply>

The Pandemic Unemployment Payment is an income support that shares the same characteristics as jobseekers benefit and similar to jobseekers benefit, is taxable income.  This ensures consistent treatment with other workers whose pay was not subsidised by the State, including those in receipt of pay commensurate with the levels of income paid out under the measures such as minimum wage workers.</p>  <p>  Tax was not collected in real-time through the PAYE system while the TWSS was in operation.  Instead, liability to tax will be calculated by Revenue through the regular end of year review process.  This decision was taken in order to maximise the amount of financial support that was provided to recipients at a time when it was considered that they needed such support most. </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s recent notification to taxpayers of the preliminary assessment of their 2020 tax liability shows that a substantial majority of all taxpayers (80%) have either no additional tax to pay or have an outstanding liability of less than &euro;200.</p>  <p>  Although the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on their personal circumstances, it is noted that almost half of those in receipt of the PUP or TWSS have no outstanding liability to discharge (in fact over a third are due a refund).</p>  <p>  In the case of the remaining taxpayer units with an outstanding liability, the data indicates that amounts to be collected are modest in scale, with 44% owing less than &euro;500 and 72% having a liability of less than &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  If paid over the 4 year period beginning in 2022, the majority of those cases will owe less than &euro;5 per week, with nearly half paying less than &euro;2.50 per week.  These figures represent a preliminary liability and may be further reduced by additional tax credits or reliefs such as health expenses.  </p>  <p>  For those with liability in excess of those amounts, their average taxable income in 2020 was higher than those with the more modest liabilities, indicating income from sources other than the State income sources.  It is also noted that those with the highest outstanding liability are those with the largest average taxable incomes, typically well in excess of average incomes (in the majority of cases with average taxable income of over &euro;70,000 per annum).</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue have adopted a fair and flexible approach to the collection tax due on payments made under the TWSS and PUP and do not plan to make any changes in that regard.</p></reply>

Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.  </p><p>This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 is at the discretion of the employer.  The value of relief allowed under the Irish system is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers.  The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally: at &euro;3.20 per day up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum may be paid tax free.  By contrast, the weekly rate in the UK is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum. </p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.  </p><p>As I announced on Budget day last October, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home. </p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website. </p><p>Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax which may be viewed at the following link:</p><p>  </p><p>Finally, the recently published N<i>ational Remote Working Strategy: Making Remote Work,</i>commits the Tax Strategy Group to reviewing the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers.

In the context of the safety protocols relating to Covid-19, the capacity of NCTS Centres is restricted and there is less opportunity to increase their level of service than would otherwise be possible.  This has resulted in delays in several Centres including the two Cork Centres.  Working hours have been extended in these Centres to address the backlog. At present customers can expect to wait between 6 and 20 working days for a pre-registration appointment; the 20 day wait occurs in two NCTS centres.</p><p>The service provider has also increased its pre-inspection service for cars held by authorised motor dealers &ndash; details are at the following links:  and .

Where the issue relates to outstanding information and documentation, the sooner the business provides the information to Revenue and/or the other State agencies, the faster the goods will be released. Goods of animal or plant origin may take longer to clear as, in addition to documentary checks, physical inspections of the goods may also be required. Physical inspection times vary depending on the size and mix of the loads and the type of the goods. I am advised by Revenue that a breakdown of the inspection times on the basis set out by the Deputy is not available. Revenue has emphasised that in its engagement with trade and businesses it has consistently drawn attention to the fact that the time taken to complete import formalities can be minimised by providing timely and accurate information as part of the customs declaration process and by timely response to requests for supplementary documentation when such requests arise.</p>  <p>  The movement details and breakdown provided to the Deputy cover destinations in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, goods destined for Northern Ireland may move under the Common Transit Convention or businesses may choose to complete their customs formalities in Ireland and subsequently move the goods to Northern Ireland.  Additionally, during the early days of January, movements that had commenced as an intra-EU movement before 11pm on 31 December 2020, did not require a customs declaration and were able to complete that movement without the need for additional paperwork.  For these reasons I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the figures by Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

To date, subsidy payments of over &euro;1.5 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;270m granted to over 41,600 employers in respect of over 467,000 employees.</p>  <p>  The scheme is demand led and the cost ultimately depends on a number of factors, including the numbers of employers making a valid claim for the subsidy and the numbers of employees they claim the subsidy in respect of.  Based on the average monthly value of the EWSS claimed to date, if the scheme was to be maintained in its current form, it is estimated that it could cost an additional &euro;350m per month in direct subsidy payments and &euro;61m in PRSI relief.  Over an additional 9 months that would cost a further &euro;3.15bn in direct subsidy and &euro;550m in PRSI relief.</p>  <p>  I have always been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.  It is noted that the legislation implementing the measure provides that it will be in place until 31 March 2021, but also allows me, as Minister for Finance, to extend the scheme until the end of June 2021, subject to certain conditions.</p>  <p>  It is likely that continued support will be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.  Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p></reply>

The scheme is an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and to deliver an enterprise support to employers based on business eligibility delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis.</p><p>As regards eligibility for the scheme, an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 30 June 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Additionally, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme. The scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in regard to terms and conditions.</p><p>The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  The EWSS is administered by Revenue on a 'self-assessment' basis and employers are required to undertake a review on the last day of every month to ensure they continue to meet the above eligibility criteria. Employers who, following a monthly review, find they no longer qualify should deregister for EWSS with immediate effect i.e. from the 1st of the following month. </p><p>The Deputy refers to orphan companies mainly attached to the entertainment and ticket industry. Without knowing the specific facts of each case it is difficult to determine eligibility based on this point.  However, as regards the film industry, Designated Activity Companies (DACs) operate as a requirement under Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which provides a corporation tax credit for eligible expenditure on qualifying films.</p><p>It is not possible for Revenue to verify whether a specific DAC would qualify for the EWSS based on the eligibility criteria but given that all balancing funding for the production above the 32% tax credit  must already be secured before claiming the credit, a reduction of earnings would not be evident at the outset.  </p><p>Section 481 is administered by both the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, in relation to the cultural and employment aspects, and Revenue, in relation to the quantum of the credit available.

Member States are expected to submit plans to the European Commission for approval no later than 30 April 2021. Disbursements will take place upon the achievement of pre-set targets and milestones identified in the plans. The final targets and milestones must be met on or before August 2026 to ensure final payments can be made.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, working with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for preparing the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.  When it has been agreed by the Government, it will be submitted to the European Commission to meet the deadline of 30 April 2021.</p>  <p>  The breakdown of the programmes and allocations to each programme will be considered by the Government as part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and it is expected to be published once it has been finalised and approved. </p></reply>

Revenue is working with businesses to resolve issues while also being mindful of the responsibility on businesses to comply with EU Customs legislation. Customs requirements can be complex for businesses, but it is essential that Ireland fulfils its obligations as a member of the EU and that we protect public health, food safety and product standards as well as the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union. </p>  <p>  I appreciate that some businesses have encountered challenges in meeting their customs obligations, but it is also important to recognise that a significant number of businesses have successfully made the transition to the new trading environment and that the majority of goods going through Dublin Port are being green routed on arrival meaning they can leave the port without the need for intervention by Customs or other State agencies.  </p>  <p>  Where businesses are experiencing delays, I am informed by Revenue that in the majority of cases, the reason for the delays have been because customs documentation has not been provided or has been completed incorrectly and as a result the goods cannot be released from the port for free circulation. To address these challenges, it is essential that businesses enhance their customs knowledge and capability as quickly as possible and that they get a full understanding of their supply chains and the role and contribution of each of the players in the supply chain to the task of completing and complying with the necessary customs formalities. The Government has provided a range of supports to assist businesses in adapting to the new rules and procedures that are now in place, including the Ready for Customs Grant scheme and the Clear Customs training programme.  Additionally, since 1 January officials and State Agencies have also been providing support and assistance on a 24/7 basis when practical difficulties and challenges arise for businesses.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it will continue to engage with individual businesses and with the relevant trade representative bodies to assist them in building the understanding and knowledge of customs formalities. As issues arise, Revenue is working with businesses on a 24/7 basis to resolve issues relating to particular movements, to ensure that the goods can move as quickly as possible. However, businesses must fully embrace the fact that the trading environment between Ireland and Great Britain has changed irrevocably following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 and there is no alternative to complying with the relevant customs formalities that are now an integral part of trade with Great Britain.</p></reply>

I have seen at first hand the impact of flooding on people and their homes and farms and I convey my deepest sympathy to all of those in the area who are being affected by flooding and the risk of flooding from Lough Funshinagh. Following severe flooding during the winter of 2015/2016, Roscommon County Council applied, in 2018, to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for funding to undertake a study at Lough Funshinagh and its environs under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. Funding approval in the amount of &euro;72,000 was given and Roscommon County Council subsequently appointed Malachy Walsh and Partners to carry out this commission. Funding for this type of exploratory work is important to identify possible engineering solutions that meet the environmental and economic requirements in advance of progressing with engineering solutions.</p>  <p>  A range of flood mitigation options have been considered for Lough Funshinagh.  It was determined that the options were not economically or environmentally sustainable.  I am advised that the current high water levels, while rare, are within the naturally occurring range.  There is no evidence to suggest that the flooding was due to an abnormal decrease in the outflow rate from the Lough other than that due to possible seasonal variation in the subsurface water level.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by my Office that the OPW did not provide funding for works at the property referred to by the Deputy, I understand these works may have been carried out by Roscommon County Council. </p>  <p>  Where no engineering solution is planned or possible for a property that was worst affected by the flooding events in 2015/2016, the Government has approved to offer humanitarian assistance to assist families relocate their primary residence. Accordingly, those property-owners in the locality of the Lough who have applied for the Government&rsquo;s Voluntary Homeowners Relocation Scheme are being advanced through this Scheme.</p>  <p>  I met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Charlie McConalogue, T.D. and officials yesterday.  We are very aware of the significant impact on the communities that flooding and the risk of flooding on Lough Funshinagh is having.  I and my colleague discussed the issues in relation to Lough Funshinagh and continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

Following extensive engineering and environmental analysis, public consultation, and a formal Public Exhibition, the proposed scheme for Blackpool was submitted to the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform for Ministerial Confirmation.</p>  <p>  The Scheme and the associated environmental assessments are currently being reviewed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Confirmation process under the Arterial Drainage Acts as required following the transposition into Irish law of EU Directive 2014/EU/52 by way of the European Union (Environmental Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019.  Further information was requested by the Minister as part of the environmental impact assessment he is required to carry out on the scheme. This information was provided to the Minister on the 2nd November 2020 and it is anticipated, pending a review of the further information supplied, that a grant of Ministerial Confirmation for the scheme will be received shortly. Once the scheme is Confirmed, a tender competition will be held to appoint a works contractor which should lead to construction works being commenced before the end of this year.</p></reply>

This 13th Century Castle is an important National Monument and visitor attraction for the area. The timber overlay steps to protect the original ancient stone stairway and provide safe access were individually sized and crafted by the OPW skilled carpenters and apprentices at the National Monuments Athenry Workshops and the discrete safety handrail was supplied by a local engineering firm. This project was part of a coordinated development with Roscommon County Council who extended visitor parking and provided flood lighting for the Castle and I would like to acknowledge their assistance and support.</p>  <p>  For health and safety reasons, visitors to the recently refurbished south west tower of Roscommon Castle must be accompanied. OPW expects to partner with the Roscommon Community Tourist Volunteer Group to assist with this and it is hoped, at this stage, that visitors can access the tower about Easter this year. This is dependent on a number of matters not least of which might be Covid 19 pandemic requirements at that time.</p></reply>

The recently commenced rollout of the national vaccination programme is a welcome development and provides hope that in 2021 we will see the beginning of the recovery for the sector but this will not happen overnight. For now, the focus remains on helping businesses and jobs in tourism to survive the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Across the economy, a range of financial supports have been put in place to give businesses the best possible chance of surviving this difficult period. The most significant of these supports is the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). According to Revenue Commissioners, over &euro;4.5 billion worth of such payments have been made to employers since the pandemic began through the EWSS and its predecessor the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). As of 14 January 2021, the Revenue Commissioners have received 18,000 registrations for the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) covering 20,700 premises, with &euro;200.6 million CRSS payments processed. Tourism businesses and employees have been significant beneficiaries of these measures. There are a number of other horizontal supports which have also benefitted tourism businesses, including: the Restart Grant; the &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme; the package of liquidity and enterprise investment measures to support small and micro companies; corporation tax refund and income tax relief for the self-employed; and the warehousing of tax liabilities.</p>  <p>  Last year, a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was appointed to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis. The taskforce did a widespread consultation whereby all sectors within tourism had an opportunity to contribute to the taskforce&rsquo;s deliberations. In addition, the taskforce met with stakeholders from all of the main sectors in tourism which helped inform the recommendations in the Tourism Recovery Plan. The taskforce presented its Tourism Recovery Plan 2020-2023 to me on 30th September last. The Plan makes a number of recommendations to help tourism businesses to survive, stabilise and recover from the COVID pandemic. It has been a very useful input for me and my colleagues in Government in considering measures to assist the sector and will remain so as we move from survival to recovery.</p>  <p>  The Tourism Recovery Plan was taken into consideration for Budget 2021, where substantial measures were put in place to support and strengthen the tourism sector. There was a record level of funding for Tourism overall, an increase of &euro;59 million over 2020 allocation, to just under &euro;221 million. The VAT rate for the Sector was reduced to 9% to help improve competitiveness and viability of businesses. In addition, a &euro;55million business continuity scheme was introduced to help strategic tourism business survive the pandemic and drive recovery. Funding of &euro;5 million has also been provided for upskilling training and to improve digital presence.</p>  <p>  Other Tourism Specific and Horizontal Supports Available include:</p>  <p>- F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;26 million COVID-19 Adaptation Fund;</p>  <p>- The Stay and Spend Initiative;</p>  <p>- A &euro;10m Coach Tourism Business Continuity Scheme; </p>  <p>- An &euro;8m Restart Grant Plus to include B&amp;B accommodation; and</p>  <p>- A &euro;10m fund to support Ireland based inbound agents who package, sell and distribute Ireland&rsquo;s tourism product overseas.</p>  <p>  As recommended in the Recovery Plan, an independently chaired Recovery Oversight Group has now been established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the Plan and monitor the sector&rsquo;s recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. I expect that this Group will submit its first report to me in the coming weeks with an update as to how the sector is faring and where the focus should lie in respect of the Plan&rsquo;s recommendations. I will take this Group's findings into account as I consider any further measures which may need to be adopted to support the sector in the short term. Subsequent measures to promote the sustainable recovery of the sector will be considered in the context of the National Economic Plan.</p></reply>

Some &euro;25 million was provided in June, including &euro;20 million for the Arts Council, as well as additional supports for regional museums. A further &euro;29 million was announced in the July stimulus, including funding for the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, our national cultural institutions, a music stimulus and supports for live performance. Significant additional funding was announced in Budget 2021, with &euro;130 million allocated to the Arts Council for 2021 and &euro;50 million for supports for life performance. Many of the supports in 2021 allowed included provision for extensive online content to be generated. Supports have also been provided to those impacted in the arts, culture, performance and events sector through the pandemic unemployment scheme and various wage subsidy schemes.</p><p>In 2021, my Department will continue to expand the delivery of our Creative Ireland programme, including through the innovative Arts and Ageing initiative with IMMA announced late last year, the wider Creativity in Older People programme and the Creativity in Schools initiatives in partnership with the Department of Education. A further 164 schools will participate in the Creative Schools initiative in 2021.</p><p>The report of the arts and culture recovery task force, entitled <i>Life Worth Living</i>, has made ten recommendations to aid the survival of this sector during Covid-19 and beyond under three themes: ensuring recovery; building resilience; and facing forward. The ten recommendations seek to protect livelihoods, mitigate income loss; ensure fair play for the makers of creative content; secure the viability of the live events industry; sustain local authority capacity to support arts and culture; ensure well-being; build sectoral capacity; make space for arts and live entertainment; provide more outdoor public spaces for cultural events; and address the environmental impact of arts, culture and event activities. The task force report is extremely beneficial to the Government as we examine ways to help the arts and culture sector to emerge from this unprecedented position.</p></reply>

The Government's clear message at the present time is for people to stay in their homes, unless necessary for those essential reasons set out in the public health regulations. Sporting activity is not considered essential in this context.</p>  <p>  The Government to keen to facilitate the maximum possible level of sporting activity at the earliest possible date once the public health circumstances have improved to the extent required.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the resumption of sporting activity, my Department and Sport Ireland continues to engage with the various sporting bodies to inform a review of the broader COVID-19 measures for sporting activity, which will be considered by Government at the appropriate time. I can assure the Deputy that the Government wishes to ensure that sport can continue to play the maximum possible role in sustaining people&rsquo;s physical and mental wellbeing and consequently their general morale.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I wrote to all National Governing Bodies of sport seeking submissions on what key modifications, in particular to Level 3 of the Government Framework, can be safely introduced to bring the most benefit to sport. Additional correspondence and templates to gather information was also provided by Sport Ireland. The sector has welcomed this engagement and to date a total of 42 submissions have been received from sporting bodies. Review and analysis of these submissions is currently underway.</p></reply>

With the exception of specific payments as outlined in the HMP as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, is assessable. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), Circular 38/2020 regarding the treatment of the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) when assessing and/or reviewing income eligibility for social housing support was issued to local authorities.  The Circular advises that the PUP payment should be considered as temporary in the overall context of an applicant household's income. </p>  <p>  In the case of a household whose income may be temporarily higher than normal due to receipt of the PUP, and where that payment results in the household finding themselves above the income threshold, the authority, under section 4 of the Household Means Policy, has the discretion to disregard income that is once off, temporary or short term in nature, and which is outside the regular pattern of a person&rsquo;s annual income. In making a determination to disregard PUP, a local authority should consider whether it may be appropriate to disregard the difference between income immediately prior to receipt of the PUP and current income. </p>  <p>  Decisions on the qualification of specific persons for social housing support and the allocation of that support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned.</p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas. Ireland's approach is to recognise the traditional right to cut turf for domestic purposes, while balancing this with our obligations under the Habitats Directive. This balanced approach is based on a respect for and understanding of that tradition and has been carefully nurtured to build trust and work with stakeholders to save the natural heritage of Ireland's bogs. </p>  <p>  In that context, the National Peatlands Strategy recognises that domestic turf cutters have a traditional right to cut turf for their own use and that this right is balanced with the conservation objectives for designated bogs and the legal obligations on the State.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provides for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to Local Authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living. </p>  <p>  Housing authorities may, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management. It is a matter for each individual housing authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

Kerry, and Heart&rsquo;s Content in Newfoundland, Canada. Transatlantic communications were operated from the Telegraph Field between 1865 and 1868. Operations were conducted initially from the Wooden Building until the Anglo-American Cable House replaced it between 1866 and 1868. Thereafter, operations transferred to the Cable Station in Knightstown before they finally ceased in 1966.</p>  <p>  The suite of sites associated with the first transatlantic telegraph are of significant importance to the history of communications technology and industrial heritage, and three key sites have been designated as an Architectural Conservation Area under the West Iveragh Local Area Plan. My Department is currently undertaking a review of Ireland&rsquo;s Tentative List of World Heritage sites and anticipates receiving an application from the local authority with respect to sites associated with the transatlantic telegraph. </p>  <p>  The Department will assess whether any such application is suitable for inclusion in the updated Tentative List to be submitted to UNESCO with the benefit of advice from an Expert Advisory Group to be established for this purpose. Key matters for appraisal in this context will be the capacity of the application to demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value and the extent of stakeholder support for the project. </p>  <p>  To be deemed of Outstanding Universal Value, a property must be so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations. It must also meet the conditions relating to integrity and/or authenticity and have an adequate protection and management system in place for all included areas to ensure their Outstanding Universal Value can be adequately safeguarded.</p></reply>

Ultimately, it is a matter for the local authority to decide the conditions to be met in relation to transfer applications.</p>  <p>  All four Dublin authorities have provisions in their allocation schemes for inter authority/mutual transfers for sitting tenants whereby the authority is prepared to accommodate applications for inter authority/mutual transfers provided certain criteria are met. All four Dublin authorities also make provision in their allocation schemes for households wishing to move to a home more suitable to their household needs. Similar arrangements apply in the two Cork and two Galway local authorities. </p>  <p>  It is also already possible for households to move and relocate between local authority areas under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme where the household income is within the appropriate income limits. Guidelines on inter-authority movement were introduced in 2017 to allow for local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority. However, the rent limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. The originating local authority will engage with the relevant new local authority to facilitate eligible requests for inter-authority movement.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Programme for Government provides for a package of social housing reforms, including the introduction of a social housing passport to allow households move from one local authority list to another.  The issue of providing for wider tenancy movements is being examined and I will look at proposals in relation to such wider movement along with the other reform package measures.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The , published in 2018, contains a range of objectives and key actions to be pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock.  The Strategy is underpinned by a number of supports available to owners to bring vacant housing stock back into use including:</p><p>- The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) is to assist private property owners, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  In 2020, I announced an increase in the funding limit for the refurbishment of properties from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000.  Since its introduction the scheme has facilitated 185 homes being brought back into use and tenanted. </p><p>- The Buy and Renew initiative particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community with the added value of delivery social housing units.  It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased. Since its introduction it has facilitated local authorities to deliver circa 600vacant properties for social housing purposes.</p><p>-  In addition, in December 2018 my Department published the Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings.  Revitalising our main streets through well designed refurbishment of residential units, particularly above shops, could help to rejuvenate smaller town centres and city streets as well as produce more houses.  The Bringing Back Homes manual is available to download at: .</p><p>To support this work at local authority level, my Department has secured funding for each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office plays a key role in the co-ordination of this work within each local authority.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-21a.408.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012100062#WRH01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 149 together.</p><p>My role with regard to the protection and management of our archaeological and architectural heritage is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, including the Planning Acts and the National Monuments Acts, as are the roles of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners.</p><p>As Minister, I am the owner or guardian under the National Monuments Acts of approximately 1,000 national monuments located at approximately 750 sites. The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk.</p><p>Responsibility for management and maintenance of historical buildings and sites in State ownership and management of related visitor facilities, rests with the Office of Public Works (OPW) which also maintains a significant ongoing programme of conservation works. My Department will allocate funding to the OPW for the maintenance of certain historic buildings and sites over the course of the year as works begin to progress again. </p><p>With regard to the safeguarding of protected structures, Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 gives primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage by including particular structures on their respective Records of Protected Structures (RPS). Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with any development proposals affecting them.</p><p>My Department provides financial support, however, for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through two grant schemes which are, in the main, administered by the local authorities. These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF). Last year some 450 heritage projects across every county in the country were allocated funding from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under these schemes and an extra &euro;1m in funding was secured for built heritage projects under the July Jobs Stimulus Package 2020, which aimed to offset some of the effects of Covid-19. </p><p>I recently launched the BHIS and HSF for 2021, with a combined allocation of &euro;6m, an increase of nearly 40%. Full details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on the website of each local authority. </p><p>My Department also announced a call for projects in September 2020 under the Community Monuments Fund (CMF) for investment in our archaeological heritage, which is being funded under the July Jobs Stimulus Package. The CMF is prioritised for local authorities, private owners and custodians, and community groups for the care, maintenance, protection and promotion of local monuments and historic sites and the provision of any required measures to ensure safe access during the Covid-19 pandemic. Total funding available for the scheme in 2020 was &euro;900,000 and 69 projects nationally were supported by the fund. I hope shortly to announce a continuance of the scheme for this year. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, preparation is well advanced in my Department on <i>Heritage Ireland 2030</i>, Ireland&rsquo;s new national heritage plan. It will be a coherent, comprehensive and inspiring framework of values, principles, strategic priorities and actions to guide and inform the heritage sector over the next decade. <i>Heritage Ireland 2030 </i>will be published early this year and will address priority issues for heritage, including those identified in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-21a.413.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021012100062#WRH02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150, 152 and 153 together.</p><p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, work is currently underway on a new Rural Development Strategy &lsquo;Our Rural Future&rsquo;, by the Department of Rural and Community Development and on updated rural settlement guidelines within my own Department.</p><p>It is clear from work undertaken by both Departments and informed by Census data, that population growth and decline in rural Ireland is uneven.  There is wide geographic variation in rural population change with some rural areas experiencing population growth while others have experienced decline.  Rural areas that recorded population growth are generally close to larger towns and cities, while those distant from, or inaccessible to, these centres have generally experienced decline.</p><p>While the <i>proportion </i>of the population classified as &lsquo;rural&rsquo; (&lsquo;aggregate rural&rsquo; definition includes all settlements with a population below 1,500 persons) has reduced, the actual number of people living in rural areas as a whole, has remained relatively constant over the past fifty years.</p><p>The National Planning Framework (NPF) fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas and recognises the distinction between growth and decline by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from unsustainable overdevelopment.  This is reflected in National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF.</p><p>In terms of sustainable housing in rural areas, Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing 2005, similarly require planning authorities to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing. The Guidelines identify a clear distinction between rural area types and include different approaches to urban and rural generated housing.  </p><p>The NPF provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines and in particular, the distinction between urban and rural generated housing.  </p><p>In this regard, NPO 19 of the NPF aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other.  </p><p>NPO19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.  </p><p>The NPF acknowledges that rural settlements are not suitable for a suburban or a high density approach to development and tailored design approaches are needed. The NPF also recognises that in rural Ireland many people seek to have an opportunity to build their own homes.  Under National Policy Objective 18b my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages and this is also reflected in the Programme for Government (PFG).</p><p>The Government has provided a strong national policy response that seeks to revitalise rural towns and villages by attracting new residents.  In this context, the Programme for Government has committed in outline to the development of a Town Centre First (TCF) policy.  An inter-Departmental Group (IDG), was established at the end of 2020 and is currently undertaking an initial scoping of the policy proposal with recommendations to be developed over the coming months.  A parallel, advisory group has also been established, to enable the experiences of a broader group of stakeholders to be brought to bear in informing the process of policy development.  </p><p>These commitments will be complemented and supported by the updated rural action plan which is being prepared by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Further, given developments in the interim, the 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are being updated, in a broader rural development and settlement context. </p></reply>

To avail of the benefits of the CTC, there are certain new requirements, including new paperwork, as well as the need for each consignment to have a financial guarantee in place to cover the potential customs duties and other taxes at risk during the movement. </p>  <p>  Ireland has undertaken significant political and official engagement with the European Commission and the most relevant EU Member States, including France, Belgium and the Netherlands, to ensure EU goods moving under transit via the UK landbridge are not subject to additional administrative burdens or unnecessary controls. Significant time was invested in securing an amendment to the EU Official Controls Regulation (OCR) to allow greater flexibility by national authorities on the process by which goods subject to SPS controls are notified to the Border Control Post (BCP) of re-entry to the EU.   </p>  <p>  While there are different systems in place depending on port of destination in the EU, for the vast majority of EU consignments transiting the landbridge, documentary checks will be performed electronically in advance of the consignment re-entering the EU and once the correct paperwork is in place, transit goods should be &ldquo;green-routed&rdquo; to leave the Port. Identity and physical checks will only be necessary where the authorities suspect non-compliance or where they have previously been required.  It is therefore vital that operators have the correct administration work in place when moving goods via the landbridge.   </p>  <p>  All these additional procedures for UK landbridge operators arise as goods moving in this way are now EU goods transiting a third country.  We have provided full details of all the new steps that must be undertaken on our website &ndash; www.gov.ie/brexit.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Government has always been very clear that the UK's decision to leave the EU, the Single Market and the Customs Union means that the seamless trade we enjoyed when the UK was a Member State is no longer possible.  The Government has put significant resources in place to assist operators adjust to the new trading environment.  I would urge all involved in moving goods, to from or through Great Britain to the avail of all appropriate supports.  </p>  <p>  No new rules or procedures apply to goods moving on direct routes between Ireland and the EU.  Demand for direct services from Ireland to the continent remains exceptionally strong.  As the Government noted in its engagement with business throughout 2020, ferry companies have responded positively to industry-led demand by putting additional capacity on direct routes.  Overall, the number of ferry services running between Rosslare and mainland Europe has trebled in the last year and there has been a significant increase in overall capacity on direct routes. </p></reply>

The Plan contains a range of commitments under the UN&rsquo;s &lsquo;Protect, Respect and Remedy&rsquo; framework under the  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as commitments to provide for greater policy coherence.  </p>  <p>  Following publication of the Plan, implementation initially focused on commitments in the area of policy coherence.  In January 2019, a multi-stakeholder implementation group with members drawn from Government, business and civil society, was established and given a three year mandate to oversee implementation of the commitments grouped under the Protect, Respect, Remedy pillars within the National Plan.  Accordingly, the Implementation Group is now two years into a three year mandate.  </p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the Implementation Group require the Implementation Group to review and update its work plan midway through its term and present its proposals to the Business and Human Rights Forum as a basis for discussions.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the Implementation Group to advance this requirement.  In the coming months, a review of the work plan to implement the National Plan to date along with proposals for the completion of any outstanding commitments will be agreed by the Implementation Group in advance of a multi-stakeholder forum on business and human rights.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department is continuing to work with the Implementation Group to advance implementation of the National Plan.  In this regard, I anticipate the completion of a Business and Human Rights toolkit for companies in the coming weeks to assist companies in meeting their responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  I would be happy to share further detail of this initiative with the Deputy in due course.</p></reply>

I am advised that the zero rating has been maintained by a number of telecoms providers and also that there is a range of unlimited mobile data packages on offer by the market.</p>  <p>  ICT Infrastructure Grant funding of &euro;100m (in two tranches of &euro;50m) issued in 2020 to schools, with schools advised to use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure owing to Covid-19 restrictions be required. Funding for ICT is issued directly to schools given that schools are best placed to determine the ICT needs of their school community. The early provision of the 2020-2021 ICT funding is to enable schools to implement Circular 0074/2020, issued in November 2020, advising schools of the requirement to provide for the continuity of teaching and learning through utilising relevant digital communications/learning platforms to support contingency planning in the event of further public health related school closures.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that in some cases a student's home broadband may present challenges for the education system in the current crisis, and that remote learning may not be appropriate or feasible for some students. With this in mind, schools have been asked to consider the needs of all students in planning their approaches to remote learning to ensure that students who may not have adequate broadband services or who may not be able to access online classes. My Department will continue to work with the education partners to support schools through the provision of relevant resources on how best to use digital and other solutions to provide continuity of learning for all students at this time.</p>  <p>  School buildings will remain open to allow for staff to facilitate remote learning. Teachers, SNAs and other school staff are allowed to travel to school as essential workers.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that my Department does not have a role in the provision of residential broadband infrastructure. Provision for such services fall to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and this is being addressed through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area. My officials have an ongoing engagement with that Department on issues relating to broadband services for schools. The Department's Schools Broadband Access Programme provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary and post primary schools and some 98% of schools avail of this service. The Schools Broadband Programme is operated by my Department at an annual cost of some &euro;13m.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;17.1 million in 2020 to all of these schools.</p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Circa. 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those most in need.  </p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million provided under Budget 2020 was allocated to 102 Primary DEIS schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year.  The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. It will run for the period of one year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per student enrolled in the school.

Similar information in respect of previous years is not readily available.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that, within the context of a rapidly increasing school population, my Department's priority is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place.  In this regard, it is sometimes necessary to make use of rented temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools.  </p><p>Furthermore, it may also be necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation when an immediate or short term need arises.  For example, a school may require a temporary building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned.  Such temporary accommodation is removed when the major project concerned is completed.  The length of time it is necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation will vary from project to project. </p><p>My Department is taking an integrated approach with the Prefab Replacement Programme through the replacement of prefabricated units as part of large-scale and devolved projects, or as part of new projects approved under the Additional School Accommodation scheme. </p><p>No. of schools currently with rented prefabs <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Primary</th>       <th>Post-Primary</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>52</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>76</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>274</td>       <td>117</td>       <td>391</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to facilitate the continuity of learning. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </i></p><p>This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>My Department has also provided updated specific guidance to advise on how schools and teachers can support continuity in the learning of learners with Special Educational Needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage during school closures due to Covid-19.  These are available at <i>.</i></p><p>It is crucially important that the learning of all students are supported at this time.

TESS staff are in ongoing contact with school principals. TESS staff are paying particular attention to students who have been previously referred to TESS, students living in direct provision accommodation centres, students temporarily living in refuges for families experiencing domestic violence, students impacted by homelessness and students from the Traveller and Roma communities to assist these students to remain linked to their schools. </p></reply>

Medmark, the current OHS provider has a process in place for school staff, including SNAs and SEN teachers, who may have health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19 through workplace attendance.</p><p>A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the employee to the OHS, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when an employee suffers from more than one health condition.  The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  An employee is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are general population risk, high risk, and very high risk. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by HSE guidance.  </p><p>Where an employee considers the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places him/her in an incorrect risk category, they can request a review where Medmark will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided. The employee may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. In the event of a review or update of the current HSE advice, Medmark will be informed, as the occupational health service provider, by the HSE, and will adjust their decision making processes accordingly.  </p><p>The HSE advice on the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group is at: <i></i>. In accordance with HSE advice, an employee in the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group who is not ill must attend the workplace. The employee in the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group should take extra care to practice social distancing and hand hygiene.  The use of face coverings and personal protective equipment may also be considered where maintaining social distancing is difficult.  </p><p>The HSE advice on the very high risk is at: <i></i>. The &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; group is currently advised to cocoon. An employee categorised by Medmark as at a very high risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19 must be facilitated by his/her employer to work from home.</p><p>The general principles to apply to the management of COVID-19 includes the safety and welfare of employees and the minimisation of the impact of COVID-19 on teaching and learning. The current COVID-19 arrangements in place for teachers and SNAs are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s<i></i>.  </p><p>The Government published the &lsquo;Work Safely Protocol&rsquo; on 20<sup>th</sup>November 2020, to replace the &lsquo;Return to Work Safely&rsquo; Protocol.  It incorporates the current advice on the Public Health measures needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace as issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), the Department of Health and Government.  It sets out the minimum measures required in every place of work to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ongoing safe operation of those workplaces.  The main updated Public Health advice includes information on the management and control of outbreaks, selection of hand sanitisers, wearing of masks, ventilation of workplaces. </p><p>As part of the Protocol, all employers are required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan in place and must ensure it is kept up to date.  The plan outlines the arrangements in place to ensure a safe workplace for all employees.  Those employees deemed &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;normal risk&rsquo; can attend the workplace safely where the school is implementing the COVID-19 Response Plan and the health advice for schools. There is an obligation on the employer to discuss the COVID-19 Response Plan with the employee and ensure that all appropriate risk mitigation measures are in place for the protection of employees in the school.  </p><p>The employer has a responsibility to assess the school environment using the COVID-19 Response Plan for the school, to ensure that all the appropriate HSE recommendations for safe school operations during Covid-19 are being implemented in full. </p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre issued advice in respect of SNAs, which sets out clearly how a safe working environment can be maintained for SNAs in schools - &lsquo;. </p><p>Every school has at least 1 Lead Worker Representative whose role is to represent staff and who may consult with, and make representations to, school management on any issue of concern in relation to COVID-19, including issues relating to at risk groups.</p></reply>

Over the past year, we have all seen how vital in-person education is for children with complex needs. </p><p>This matter has been highlighted not only by the families of the children themselves, but also by all the partners in education and representative groups, in regular meetings with me and my officials. Everyone recognises that distance learning does not work for every child.</p><p>Recent weeks have seen intense and regular engagement with partners to seek a solution to our shared objective to support children with complex needs return to in-school learning, could be reached.</p><p>My Department sought to agree an approach balancing the need to support our most vulnerable children while addressing the issues raised by trade unions and school management bodies.</p><p>These included requests for clear messaging around public health to be given directly to their members by Public Health specialists, temporary arrangements during the current phase of reopening for high risk staff and for those experiencing childcare difficulties.</p><p>In response my Department set out to the unions how it these concerns would be addressed. This included:</p><p>- Temporary flexible accommodations to work remotely or carry out duties where they are not in close contact or providing personal care</p><p>- Temporary waivers to notice periods around parental leave and unpaid leave schemes </p><p>- Speedy turnaround for applications through the National Childcare scheme with subsidies for full time childcare available</p><p>- A  webinar to address public health concerns was held by the Deputy CMO Dr Ronan Glynn and senior public health consultants which was directly accessible through online streaming to all education sector staff </p><p>Public Health Officials reaffirmed clearly that schools with risk mitigation measures in place provide a safe environment for staff and children. </p><p>While the general public heath advice is that people stay at home, this does not apply to workers providing an essential service like teachers and SNAs. </p><p>In this context it is considered that schools could reopen for just over 23,000 children with SEN (or just 4% of those who would attend during a full re-opening). These children are those who experience the greatest difficulty benefitting from remote learning.</p><p>Despite this there is still no commitment from the primary teacher and SNA trade unions, INTO and FORSA, to advise their members to commence the limited return of in-person learning for children with special educational needs. </p><p>I will continue to pursue every avenue to ensure that children with complex needs can return to in-person learning as immediately as possible and I will continue to engage with stakeholders on the issue. </p><p>In the interim I am confident that schools will continue to make significant efforts to provide effective remote learning experiences for these children.  </p><p>My Department has issued updated guidance on continuity of schooling: supporting pupils with Special Educational Needs (with separate guidance for mainstream primary/special schools and for post-primary schools). </p><p>This outlines that teachers in special schools and special classes should make every effort to maintain regular contact with all of their pupils, and where appropriate, make provision for one-to-one online supports.</p><p>Extensive support and advice for schools regarding the provision of distance learning is also available through the Department&rsquo;s support services and agencies including for those pupils with special educational needs.</p></reply>

It is accepted that good connectivity is essential to ensure that schools are facilitated to progress the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning and for the implementation of new and revised curriculum. </p>  <p>  Under the School Broadband Programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements.  Currently investment of some &euro;13m is allocated annually for the provision of internet connectivity to schools. Broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on local infrastructure which can impact on the service that can be provided in individual schools. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is currently on the best available service of 8mb wireless connection, which is a dedicated service to the school.  The school was included in a recent tender for the provision of broadband and tenders were received from providers of fixed wireless services. The school was awarded to the highest placed tenderer in accordance with procurement requirements, but due to line of sight issues to the provider&rsquo;s infrastructure the install was not possible. This was also the case with the other tenderers who bid for the school. This school is included in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area Plan, with the school scheduled to receive high speed fibre broadband in mid-2021. When the high speed infrastructure is in place for this school through the NBP, the service will be upgraded to the school through the School Broadband Programme.</p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan Intervention Area Plan implementation is now underway, and as announced recently, the provision of high speed connectivity to the almost 700 primary schools in that area is to be accelerated for delivery by the end of 2022. My Department is engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the intervention area implementation, including the Schools Broadband Connection Points Programme. </p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is under way by the SEC and the Department.  It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19.  This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned for this week.  The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures.</p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February.</p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.</p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future.  As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool.  This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects.</p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure.  As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice.  The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the SEC also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at .</p><p>Further updates regarding the submission of coursework, the RACE scheme, the Leaving Certificate Applied programme and examination entries for 2021 were issued by the SEC to schools on 14 January. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.  </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;.  These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.  </p></reply>

The Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate subject specifications for History provide flexibility and opportunities for the findings of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission report and other reports on institutional abuse to be explored.  The specifications allow teachers to integrate these issues into their teaching and discussion and to encourage reflection in them.  The new Leaving Certificate specification for Politics and Society allows for consideration of contemporary or topical, political issues as they arise.  This provides further opportunities for learning in the area.  In Transition Year there is also flexibility to design relevant learning experiences for students in this area. </p></reply>

The evidence to date from a public health perspective is that schools are safe.  The approach to Covid-19 in schools is led by the advice and guidance of the HSE Public Health.</p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the measures promoted by the HPSC.</p>  <p>  The HPSC advice advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being.  This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members.  The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with public health and partners at the present time has focused on the safe phased return of children with special educational needs to in-school learning on the 21 January.  Regrettably despite intensive engagements it has not being possible to achieve this shared objective.  The Department will continue to engage with our partners to provide in school learning for this important cohort of pupils as soon as is possible.</p></reply>

An Operations Team has been set up in the ESBS to manage this service from an operational perspective.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the specific queries raised in the correspondence supplied, I can confirm that my officials have created detailed FAQs and information in relation to Apprentice Off-the-Job Training Payments &amp;amp; Allowances and these are available on the SOLAS Generation Apprenticeship website.

This link also includes an important Apprentice FAQ document in the first section.  </p>  <p>  There is also a detailed section in relation to the process associated with the Apprentice&rsquo;s first off-the-job payment.  In this regard it is important to note that Income tax; PRSI and USC will be deducted from each Apprentice&rsquo;s payment and sent to Revenue automatically.  The rate of taxation that an Apprentice pays is set by Revenue and will depend on your own personal circumstances.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that not all Apprentices will be subject to Emergency Tax for their first payment; however, if any Apprentices are subject to Emergency Tax then the FAQs detail how Apprentices can make any required changes to their Tax Credits and/or Rate Bands at the appropriate time to ensure that any emergency tax deducted will be refunded during the next pay period provided their Revenue record has been updated in line with the process outlined in the FAQs and that Revenue place the Apprentice on a cumulative tax certificate (which is done automatically in most instances).</p>  <p>  As outlined earlier, I strongly advise all Apprentices to log on and read the detailed FAQs on the SOLAS Generation Apprenticeship website here as doing so will ensure that all Apprentices will receive their full payment entitlements while undertaking Off-the-Job training.    </p>  <p>  Finally, my officials have been in touch with the ETB, listed in the correspondence provided, and I can confirm that staff in the Finance section in the ETB have made contact with the individual in question to outline the pertinent matters directly to him.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.</p><p>Planning for these examinations is under way by the SEC and the Department.  It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19.  This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned for this week.  The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures.</p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February.</p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.</p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future.  As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool.  This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021.  This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects.</p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure.  As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice.  The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time.  The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the SEC also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at <i></i>.</p><p>Further updates regarding the submission of coursework, the RACE scheme, the Leaving Certificate Applied programme and examination entries for 2021 were issued by the SEC to schools on 14 January. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.  </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;.  These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.  </p></reply>

These documents have been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 which required all schools to put in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.  My Department has also recently provided updated specific guidance to advise on how schools and teachers can support continuity in the learning of vulnerable students and those at risk if educational disadvantage during school closures due to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Schools are asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or technology and to adapt approaches to ensure that these pupils&rsquo; ability to participate in learning is not compromised.  Many schools have already introduced a range of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of these pupils are catered for, including pupils who have limited access to technology or whose parents are not in a position to support their learning.  The guidance sets out approaches that schools can take and my Department will be asking schools to ensure that there is a specific focus on ensure that these pupils are supported. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided significant additional resources to schools to help support the provision of ICT equipment and to prioritise the needs of students that do not otherwise have access to ICT. My Department issued &euro;50m in April 2020 in Digital Strategy ICT grant funding in respect of the 2019-2020 school year, including &euro;10m brought forward. A further &euro;50m issued in December 2020 in respect of the 2020-2021 school year.  Schools were advised to use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure owing to Covid-19 restrictions be required.</p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Services will engage with principals to promote connectedness to schools for children who are at risk of educational disadvantage and there will be direct liaison by education welfare officers to Direct Provision accommodation centres, refuges for families experiencing domestic violence and homeless hubs to ensure students are linked with their schools. </p>  <p>  My Department spends in the region of &euro;125 million annually to provide a suite of supports to schools in the DEIS programme, of which &euro;16.2 million was allocated to schools in the form of a DEIS grant for the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  Schools in the DEIS programme are asked to use all available supports, both in-school and community-based, to promote a positive solution-oriented approach that will support all pupils to achieve, to learn and to progress in their education and to help minimize any further educational inequality among those at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 113,100 children, including over 14,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. Based on the public health advice published in July 2020, and the updated advice received from the HPSC on 7th August and from NPHET on the 18th August 2020, the Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, using 50% of passenger capacity.  </p>  <p>  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children. The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of months while Bus &Eacute;ireann is continuing to put in place the additional services required to fully implement the advice on all routes.  Before Christmas circa 74% of total post-primary routes were operating at 50% capacity and planning is underway for all remaining routes to be implemented at 50% capacity in the coming weeks; this will be progressed as schools re-open. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education have supported all bus contractors to put in place measures to support infection prevention and control on the buses.  The Department has also issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. Measures include all post-primary students wearing masks, all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses.  Seating plans with pre-assigned seating are in place on all routes, with children sitting next to their siblings or classmates where possible. This reduces the interaction of children on the buses with those outside of their family, class or school. </p></reply>

The Department has always been guided by public health advice in relation to what is safe in schools. NPHET meet regularly and has considered the latest evidence and remain of the view that schools are low risk environments but recognise there is a need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at this time.</p>  <p>  The Government decision, taken on 6 January, on foot of public health advice to reduce mobility in the community, was to close schools for the vast majority of students for a period of three weeks. The Government&rsquo;s decision included prioritising in-person teaching and learning for two specific cohorts; pupils/ students attending special schools and classes and final year Leaving Certificate students. This decision was supported by the public health advice available to Government. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with public health and partners at the present time has focused on the safe phased return of children with special educational needs to in-school learning on the 21 January. Regrettably despite intensive engagements it has not being possible to achieve this shared objective.  The Department will continue to engage with our partners to provide in school learning for this important cohort of pupils as soon as is possible.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned for this week. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures.</p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February.</p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.</p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects.</p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the SEC also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at <i></i>.</p><p>Further updates regarding the submission of coursework, the RACE scheme, the Leaving Certificate Applied programme and examination entries for 2021 were issued by the SEC to schools on 14 January. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.  </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p></reply>

The current restrictions mean the demand for public employment services will grow, rather than shrink, in the short-to-medium term. </p><p>I should emphasise that JobPath is just one element of the Department's response to the labour market challenges we face.  We are also expanding the capacity of other contracted employment services such as the Local Employment Services, Job Clubs and Employability, the contracts for whom have also been extended into this year.</p><p>We will be expanding the footprint of the community based contracted service into 4 new geographical areas where a Local Employment Service does not currently exist and we are also expanding the capacity of Intreo Centres to provide employment services and supports with the assignment of an additional 100 Job Coaches this year.</p><p>Significantly reducing the State's capacity to engage meaningfully with those seeking employment at this time is counter-intuitive and likely only to lead to greater long-term unemployment.</p><p>In April 2019, my Department published an econometric review of JobPath, which comprehensively demonstrated the effectiveness of the JobPath service in terms of its success in assisting people secure employment. Compared to other employment service supports, individuals who participated in JobPath were more likely to secure employment, to remain in employment for longer and to receive higher rates of earnings from employment compared to individuals who were not supported by the JobPath service.  </p><p>My Department has ceased new referrals to all public employment services on each occasion when Covid-19 restrictions merited it. There are currently no new referrals being made. In addition, any reduced rates of payment for non-engagement with any public employment service provider have been suspended since March 2020.</p><p>Currently Pandemic Unemployment Payment recipients are not required to engage with public employment services. For jobseekers who do engage with such services, my Department does not tolerate, nor will it tolerate its contractors threatening jobseekers. I invite the Deputy to contact my office with any allegations of threats or inappropriate pressure.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These supports include Community Employment (CE) and JobPath.</p><p>CE is an active labour market programme designed to enhance the employability of disadvantaged and unemployed people by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities.  The programme helps break the cycle of unemployment and improve a person&rsquo;s chances of returning to the labour market.</p><p>JobPath is an employment activation service that supports people who are long-term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to secure and sustain paid employment. The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua.</p><p>From the 1st June 2018, persons availing of the JobPath service have also been able to participle on CE.  This enables long-term jobseekers to benefit from the strengths of both programmes, the job-seeking support of a JobPath personal advisor and quality training and development opportunities provided by the CE scheme.</p><p>The Department's activation teams contacts long-term jobseekers to seek expressions of interest in participation on the CE programme.  The following table provides a breakdown of the number of those recorded contacts made with potential CE candidates by Department Case Officers and Local Employment Services from the end of November, 2017 until the end of December 2020.

CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification. </p>  <p>  CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award.</p>  <p>  A maximum of three consecutive year's participation on CE is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a twelve-month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).  </p>  <p>  CE participants over the age of 62 can participate on CE on a continuous basis until they reach the State Pension age via the CE Service Support Stream (SSS).  Participation is subject to the availability of SSS places, satisfactory performance on the CE scheme and, annual approval by the Department.  The number of places available for SSS participants within each CE scheme is subject to limitation criteria.</p>  <p>  Up to recently, CE recruitment has not presented an issue for CE sponsoring authorities or the Department. However, the challenges caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pubic health restrictions in place to varying levels since last year, coupled with the return to Level-5 restrictions, has had a negative impact on the ability of a number of CE schemes to recruit new CE participants.</p>  <p>  Throughout the onset of the Covid-19 emergency in March 2020, the subsequent level-5 restrictions introduced in October, 2020 and more recently, the return to level 5 restrictions announced by Government in December, 2020, my Department has continued to provide funding and support  for CE schemes while introducing other contingency measures, to support CE schemes and CE participants, including the extension of CE participant contracts.</p>  <p>  Department officials have continued to liaise with CE sponsoring authorities throughout the three waves of the Covid-19 emergency to arrange for CE participants who were due to finish on their respective CE schemes, to have their contracts extended while the level-5 restrictions are in place, unless a CE participant is taking up employment or reaches the State Pension age.  The latest CE contract extension date for any persons whose contract were due to come to a end since last October is the 26th March, 2021 and it is intended that there will be a phased ending of contracts for this cohort of CE participants after this date. </p>  <p>  CE eligibility is continually evaluated by my Department officials and relevant proposals continue to inform related policy discussions.  Other than the above contingency measure, it is not my intention to revisit the 3 year rule at this juncture, as to do some would prevent other long term unemployed persons availing of this worthwhile opportunity. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;265 million in 2021.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the fuel allowance season will result in increased scheme budgetary requirements and would be a matter for Government to consider in the overall context of available financial resources in 2021.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, the Government targeted one third of additional carbon tax revenues to go towards boosting the incomes of poorest in our society.  Based on ESRI research, three key social welfare payments were targeted for increases in the budget as a result - the Fuel Allowance, the Qualified Child Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance.  </p>  <p>  From January 2021, the Fuel Allowance was increased by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks, while the increase in carbon tax on solid fuels will not take effect until May 2021.  This will ensure that recipients will benefit from the increased payment over this winter period.   </p>  <p>  The overall additional funding already provided by the Government for Fuel Allowance in 2021 is approximately &euro;36.8m or &euro;98 per recipient household.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of a person who is experiencing particular financial difficulties, she could draw their attention to the fact that financial assistance is also available under the Exceptional Needs Payment and the Urgent Needs Payment schemes, on a year round basis, to assist with expenditure which a person could not reasonably meet out of his/her weekly income, and which may include exceptional heating costs.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, my department has both commissioned and directly undertaken a range of research activities relating to the impact of COVID-19 on children and young people. Details of these research activities are as follows:</p><p>-  * Published by the ESRI in July 2020, as part of the DCEDIY/ESRI Research Partnership, the report <i>&lsquo;Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for policy in relation to children and young people: A research review&rsquo; </i>presents a critical synthesis of existing Irish and international research involving children and young people before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period as a basis for discussing the implications for policy development. For a copy of the report see: </p><p>-  * In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, three surveys for Growing Up in Ireland (GUI), the DCEDIY funded national longitudinal study of children, were in the field at the end of 2020. These surveys have collected data regarding the impact of COVID-19 from both parents and 13-year-olds from GUI Cohort &rsquo;08, and the 22-year-old GUI Cohort &rsquo;98.  Because the GUI is a longitudinal survey, the findings can be linked to individual experiences pre-pandemic; it will also deepen and broaden what we know about the long-term impacts of the pandemic on children and young people. Data from these surveys will be published as quickly as possible in the coming months and will be made available to all bona fide researchers.</p><p>-  * Launched in September 2020 the report, <i>&lsquo;How&rsquo;s Your Head</i>, details the findings of the national consultation with young people on their experiences of COVID-19.  The consultation, in collaboration with SpunOut.ie, sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 on young people with specific focus on their mental health and wellbeing. The survey attracted 2,173 respondents aged 15-24, representing every county in Ireland. For a copy of the report see:  </p><p>-  *My department undertook a programme of research in response to the COVID-19 closures and phased reopening of the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) sector. The research included:</p><p>-<i>IPSOS MRBI were commissioned by the Department to undertake two waves of a household poll of 500 households with children. </i></p><p><i>- A survey was administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department to all 4,500 ELC and SAC providers.</i></p><p><i>- An open online Call for Submissions was issued by the Department, receiving 1916 responses.</i></p><p>In addition, a number of briefs on policy and financial responses in other jurisdictions were prepared. The purpose of this research was to inform policy in the childcare sector by capturing the views of the sector, and by trying to understand the demand for and availability of childcare services post-COVID-19<i>.</i></p><p>-  * Data collection exercises, including both interviews and focus groups, intended to gather information on parents&rsquo; experiences of parenting supports were undertaken recently. Included in the list of questions were a number concerning the impact of COVID-19 on these experiences.</p><p>-  * Following a request from the Irish Association of Social Workers (IASW), my department helped fund an online survey of social workers to capture the impact of COVID-19 on their work. The survey ran from 12th May to 29th June and a total of 456 responses were received.  In addition to detailing the challenges faced by social workers, the findings also included concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on the children and families with whom social workers routinely interact. Full details of the findings from the survey are available on the IASW website: .</p><p>Combined, the research detailed above represents a significant effort on the part of my department to provide a diversity of insights into the impact of COVID-19 on children and young people, in both the near-term and the long-term. When taken in conjunction with work carried out independently of my department, I believe there is a large body of information emerging to inform policies that help to mitigate the worst impacts of COVID-19 on children and young people.</p></reply>

At 8:00am on the morning of Tuesday 12th, some members of the media were provided with electronic access to a copy of the report to facilitate detailed coverage, under very strict embargo. This practice provides that a detailed, sensitive and informed public discourse can take place, and follows practice employed in publication of other reports of such magnitude. The journalists who were given this access abided by that embargo to ensure that no elements of the report came into the public domain prior to survivors joining the Taoiseach and the Minister at a webinar at 1:30pm, and before it was published at 3pm.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter of deep regret that details of the Commission's Final Report were leaked to a Sunday Newspaper ahead of its publication. It is important to state that this coverage did not originate from the access provided by my Department under embargo on the day of publication as this was done two days later. </p>  <p>  I contacted survivors immediately on learning of this coverage and that matter is now under investigation.

In the case of Bessborough, the Commission reported that it was unable to locate the burial place of most of the children, some 859 persons, who died there. This is a deeply tragic state of affairs. </p>  <p>  In its Fifth Interim Report, the Commission outlined the extensive measures it took to locate the burials at Bessborough and, while it did conclude that burials are likely to have taken place on the grounds, it also concluded that further investigation of the 200 acre site was not feasible in the absence of further information. I echo the Commission&rsquo;s plea that anyone in possession of information regarding burials at Bessborough would please come forward. </p>  <p>  I note that much of the Bessborough site is now in private ownership. I possess no powers to conduct or order investigations regarding burial sites on privately owned land. </p>  <p>  I am aware that two applications for planning permission have been sought in respect of the Bessborough site. I have made submissions to Cork City Council and to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as part of the statutory planning process, outlining my strongly held view that proper account should be taken of the history and sensitivity of the Bessborough site, and that at a minimum further archaeological investigation of the proposed development site should attach as a condition to any potential grant of planning permission.

Its terms of reference are attached to the Government Order establishing the Commission (Statutory Instrument No. 57 of 2015).  The Commission was tasked with a comprehensive investigation of the practices and procedures regarding the care and welfare of residents in these institutions and the entry arrangements and exit pathways for mothers and their children. </p>  <p>  The Commission was established in response to significant concerns around a specific type of institution, namely mother and baby homes. Initially the focus was very narrow and related to concerns with the former home in Tuam, Co. Galway. This focus broadened in the course of the extensive public consultation process which assisted Government in defining the terms of reference. The investigation was framed to provide a clear emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in these institutions. This was a deliberately focused approach. </p>  <p>  Clear criteria were used to identify relevant institutions and all institutions identified as meeting these criteria were included in the terms of reference. The criteria used to identify Mother and Baby homes included having the main function of providing sheltered and supervised ante- and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children, including both board and lodgings; and an ethos which those running the institutions considered to promote a regime of work, training or education as part of an overall approach to either rehabilitating single mothers, or to give them training for living independently.</p>  <p>  The complexity in the classification of these institutions, and the challenge of identifying the specific institutions which catered primarily for unmarried mothers and the children since the establishment of the State, was examined in detail by an Inter-Departmental group which advised Government on these matters. Its report was published in July 2014. The advice to the Government was that the specific institutions should be named in the terms of reference to assist the Commission in its task. </p>  <p>  Fourteen institutions were named in the terms of reference and the Commission was also tasked with investigating a representative sample of those County Homes which provided mother and baby type services as a considerable focus of their operations. Four County Homes were subsequently selected by the Commission as a representative sample.  The Commission's Final Report includes chapters dealing with each of these individual institutions. </p></reply>

The National Standards meet the requirements of the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive (Directive 2013/33/EU) which we voluntarily opted into in June 2018.</p>  <p>  We hope to begin this monitoring by HIQA in the coming months.  A strong and transparent monitoring capacity is crucial to ensure that quality of service is maintained during the significant transformation process that will occur over the coming years. </p>  <p>  Accommodation centres are currently subject to regular unannounced inspections by both my officials in the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) and an independent inspectorate company (QTS Limited).   </p>  <p>  The implementation of the National Standards, combined with ongoing improvements such as the roll-out of cooking facilities and independent living through the most recent procurement process, demonstrate the continual improvements being made to the accommodation provided to persons seeking international protection in Ireland.  All properties selected under the recent tender process were required to be able to implement the National Standards for accommodation centres. This requirement applies to the provision of new centres and to any renewal of a contract with a current provider.</p>  <p>  The requirement for inspection of dedicated accommodation centres is also a contractual obligation for the contractors.  These inspections are generally undertaken, twice yearly by my officials in IPAS and once yearly by QTS Limited.  Inspections cover a wide range of issues including the quality of the food quality, fire safety, appropriate signage and information for residents, the condition of communal areas and sleeping quarters and adherence to hygiene and other health and safety measures. Completed inspections are published on www.ria.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The current inspection programme was severely compromised by the COVID -19 pandemic. All inspections were suspended temporarily during the first phase of COVID-19 restrictions but they recommenced on 14 September 2020 with all necessary safeguards in place. My Department was able to ensure that all centres, with the exception of the new centre in Dominick Street in Galway which was not fully occupied until late 2020, were inspected at least once by IPAS officials with 21 centres being inspected twice by IPAS officials. Furthermore QTS carried out an additional 29 inspections in 2020.  This gives a combined total of 94 inspections carried out in 2020.</p>  <p>  There are currently 45 designated accommodation centres that come under the inspections programme including the National Reception Centre in Balseskin, Co. Dublin. </p></reply>

As part of this pilot, IPAS interview applicants to obtain information that will help establish if any categories of vulnerability apply. This is done in a sensitive, conversational manner with gender-appropriate officers and interpretation as required.  A list of standard questions, based on the various categories of vulnerability identified within the EU Reception Conditions Directive 2013/33/EU, and refined for the Irish context with the help of the HSE, is available to the assessor and applicant to help ensure that the interview stays focused on its purpose.     </p>  <p>  It is intended that the questions used will be kept under review and refined to ensure the process continues to elicit the best possible information to assist in the assessment.</p>  <p>  The White Paper process on the reform of the international protection reception and accommodation system is currently underway, and as part of that process further detailed measures are being examined in relation to identifying and supporting those applicants who arrive to Ireland with a vulnerability or intersecting vulnerabilities. </p>  <p>  Four assessments under the pilot process have taken place to date with the assistance of the HSE.

Policy is coordinated by the Department of Justice. Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. Capital funding for approved housing bodies, including services that provide refuge accommodation for victims of DSGBV, is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that I was able to procure &euro;30m for Tusla in Budget 2021, specifically allocated for DSGBV services.

This will assess the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation.

Service providers are contracted by my Department to provide services at a subsidised rate to parents and are free to set their own policies regarding the charging of fees.  The current agreements between the Department and providers do not deal with the issue of services charging fees during periods when the services are closed. The relationship between a service provider and parent is a private one based on a contract between those two parties.</p>  <p>  If a parent of an eligible child chooses not to take up the service, providers may make arrangements about fees with the parent in the context of their contract.  My Department have informed parents that if there is currently no restriction on their access to a service for which they have an agreed contract, the expectation is that fees would still be required. If a parent wishes to change their ELC/SAC arrangements, the contract between the parent and provider will indicate the applicable notice period or conditions.</p>  <p>  I am aware however, and welcome that, many ELC/SAC providers have refunded or credited fees for parents who are not accessing services at this time. I encourage all services to take this step, where possible, in light of the significant State supports provided to the sector.</p></reply>

This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level.</p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer currently contributes &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students in higher education.  In addition, the Exchequer pays the student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students at a cost of over &euro;180m.</p>  <p>  Under Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID all further and higher education institutions will deliver the majority of their classes online with only essential activities held on site.  While I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures were necessary to support halting the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 2020/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state.</p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.</p>  <p>  The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education.</p></reply>

The main objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study.

The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding.</p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

This service is a mature solution across Irish higher education where students have used it to access on line services at any higher education institution not just the institution they are attending. The service is possible because the large education institutions have strong identity management solutions in place and HEAnet manages that service and the network over which the traffic is carried. The proposed roll out to 90 locations in 2021 leverages existing infrastructure and the HEAnet network, therefore no additional costs will arise in the majority of cases. Modest configuration costs may arise at some sites and will be met out of HEAnet&rsquo;s existing funding.</p></reply>

Financial assistance will be provided to all SUSI eligible students and to EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state.</p>  <p>  The scheme will ensure students;</p>  <p>  - Who avail of the SUSI grant, including students abroad, will receive &euro;250 top-up in their grant;</p>  <p>  - Students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution;</p>  <p>  - In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the monies to students at the discretion of institutions.</p>  <p>  The latter two options are designed to ensure students who are not in receipt of SUSI benefit from the measure. It is also the intention that these address circumstances where students are in final year, have paid their contribution fee and may not be on campus.</p>  <p>  Irish/EU/EEA students partaking in courses in other countries who are in receipt of SUSI support are eligible for the payment if they are attending approved SUSI courses in approved higher education institutions within the EU.  However other EU fulltime students outside of the SUSI system must be registered in a publicly funded higher education provider in the State to avail of this allocation. </p>  <p>  In terms of other Irish nationals studying abroad, the provision of supports to Irish citizens based on nationality alone with the exclusion of other EU nationals would be contrary to EU law. It is therefore not possible to provide supports based on Irish citizenship alone. Instead the measure applies to all of these qualifying for SUSI grants, wherever they are studying and those of EU nationality at publicly funded higher education institutions in the State. Additionally a key administrative feature of the fund is that it is being implemented with the assistance of publicly funded institutions in the State under the remit of my Department.  </p>  <p>  The main support available to assist students with the cost of higher education is the Student Grant Scheme. Students attending approved undergraduate courses in Northern Ireland can apply for a maintenance grant provided they meet the terms and conditions of the Student Grant Scheme. There is also a special derogation contained within the Student Support Act 2011 which provides supports for postgraduate students attending courses in Northern Ireland. Such students may be eligible for assistance towards their postgraduate fees up to the maximum fees limit of &euro;6,270 or a Postgraduate Fee Contribution of &euro;2,000 subject to satisfying the terms and conditions of the Student Grant Scheme 2020. There is no other provision under the student grant scheme for the payment of fees to students studying outside of the State.</p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on www.revenue.ie.</p>  <p>  Prospective students may also wish to contact the relevant college in Northern Ireland for advice on the type and range of supports that are available in that particular college.</p></reply>

These range from remote or online learning to one day per week in an education institution or, in the case of craft apprenticeships, in periods of 10-35 week placements in Education and Training Boards (ETBs) or Institutes of Technology/Technological Universities. Many academic and vocational courses in the further and higher education and training sector also incorporate work placements, however these learners are not employees for the full duration of their course.</p>  <p>  Waiting time for electrical and certain other craft apprenticeships are linked to physical capacity in ETB Training Centres and Institutes of Technology/Technological Universities.  Pre COVID-19 the rapid rate of recovery of craft apprentice registrations due to the recovery of the construction sector was placing the existing off-the-job training facilities under stress.</p>  <p>  In March 2020, all face to face off-the-job training for craft apprenticeship programmes was suspended.  The closure of the education and training sector to face to face delivery of training between March and September 2020 resulted in the immediate loss of approximately 2,200 training places on phase 4 &amp;amp; 6 craft apprenticeships (April intake) and in the region of 2,000 phase 2 training places over the period of the closure. In addition to the immediate loss of places, the return to face to face training in September was subject to strict Covid-19 measures which has resulted in the reduction of available places.  </p>  <p>  Other apprenticeships in areas which were amenable to remote delivery moved fully online or were modified to allow for greater flexibility between on-the-job and off-the-job elements of the programmes. Unfortunately, it was not possible to deliver this flexibility in programme provision or assessment in the practical elements of craft apprenticeships (Phases 2, 4 and 6) due to the need to access workshops and equipment together. This, with the simultaneous closure of the construction sector, meant that apprentices progress through their programme was delayed.  </p>  <p>  The following measures have been taken to ameliorate the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 measures on craft apprentices and to move to reduce waiting times for off-the-job training for certain craft apprenticeships:</p>  <p>  - An alternative assessment approach was delivered for the theory assessments for up to 2,500 craft apprentices who had been close to finishing their phase of training at the time of the shutdown in March.  Outstanding practical assessments were prioritised for completion in September 2020, with over 1,000 apprentices completing practical assessments and their phase of training.</p>  <p>  - Craft apprentices who had had their off-the-job training interrupted in March 2020 were prioritised for a return to training from 31 August (ETB training centres) and from 10 September (Institutes of Technology and TU Dublin).</p>  <p>  - Additional trainer posts have been sanctioned on a temporary basis where ETBs have identified a need for additional staff to deliver off-the-job training within Covid-19 guidelines.</p>  <p>  - &euro;12m has been provided in Budget 2021 to support additional places which will mitigate against the effect of smaller apprenticeship class sizes and catch up on lost provision in spring and summer 2020.</p>  <p>  - SOLAS and the HEA have issued calls for proposals to all craft apprenticeship training providers to identify additional capacity that could be developed for apprenticeship training.</p>  <p>  - The HEA and SOLAS are also engaging further in relation to the curricula to see what parts can be delivered online and are working with the sector to see which elements of craft apprenticeship might be amenable to blended learning.</p>  <p>  Following the 6 January 2021 Government advice to minimise movement over the coming weeks, off-the-job training for craft apprentices has moved to primarily online delivery for the month of January. There will be a focus on theory-based elements of the curriculum during this period, and teaching and learning supports will be provided by Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and the Technological Universities.</p></reply>

A comprehensive recruitment and selection process was undertaken in 2020 to fill the vacancies. In August 2020, expressions of interest were sought from practising barristers and solicitors for the part-time roles of Ordinary Member and/or Chair. </p>  <p>  A Board was appointed to undertake the selection process. The Board assessed the 108 applications received and held individual meetings with 57 shortlisted applicants. The Board presented its recommendations which I received in December 2020. I have recently approved the recommendations made by the Board, including the formation of a panel from which future appointments up to June 2025 may be made. Seven offers of appointment have been made to those on the panel to the position of Chair and Ordinary Members, as is provided for under paragraph 17 of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. As noted in the application booklet, the number of Tribunal Members is under review with a view to increasing membership.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently liaising with the proposed appointees to obtain the necessary formal acceptance and confirmation of tax clearance. It is expected that this process will be finalised very shortly, upon which the warrants of appointment will be issued and the new Tribunal membership will officially take up duty. </p>  <p>  Six Departmental staff act as secretariat to the Tribunal. These staff receive applications and gather the necessary information from applicants and other stakeholders such as medical reports and the Garda report.  When all required information is ready, Tribunal staff send the file to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. Where a decision is appealed, Tribunal staff make arrangements for a Tribunal appeal hearing. </p>  <p>  In terms of the duration of the process, I am advised that it may take several years before an application for compensation is ready for submission to the Tribunal. Final Garda reports on the crime are required, as are the outcomes of any court cases initiated. In some cases, the extent of injuries suffered by the victim may not be known for some years and medical and other expert reports may be outstanding for a significant period. Sometimes, applicants may not reply to correspondence seeking required additional information. With certain claims, loss of earnings for consideration by the Tribunal may be complex, requiring employer reports, actuarial assessment and social welfare reports. </p>  <p>  I can however assure the Deputy that applications made under the Scheme continue to be actively processed by the Tribunal and its supporting secretariat throughout 2020 with a total of 335 decisions being made during the year by Tribunal members on applications received. This was despite the practical difficulties presented by the current pandemic. </p>  <p>  Finally, I can also advise the Deputy that I am currently considering the bringing of a range of reforms before Government for this long standing Scheme to better serve victims of crime by improving its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></reply>

I understand that the current interest in catalytic converter theft may be directly associated with the current high price of palladium available on the market. </p>  <p>  I am informed that Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) have taken a proactive, co-ordinated and targeted approach in response to this issue.  Information and intelligence in relation to individuals and gangs involved in the theft of catalytic converters continues to be assessed, evaluated and developed. This approach has resulted in a number of successful Garda operations over the last year in the DMR. Garda&iacute; have delivered a number of co-ordinated and managed arrests of individuals identified as being involved in or associated with thefts of these devices and searches of certain locations and properties which resulted in the seizure of catalytic converters. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for offences of theft, the handling of stolen property and the possession of stolen property. The offence of theft provided for by this legislation would, based on the broad nature of the offence, include the theft of scrap metal and catalytic converters. A maximum sentence of 10 years in prison is provided for in the case of convictions for offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison is provided for convictions for the offence of possession of stolen property. </p>  <p>  Irish law relating to the sale and purchase of scrap metal is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and arises under the Waste Management Act 1996. The Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 apply to the sale and purchase of scrap metals and were designed to improve the traceability of such scrap metal sales. The regulations impose an obligation on businesses to apply due diligence measures to ensure the traceability of any waste purchased. </p>  <p>  Community Garda&iacute; are also available to provide crime prevention advice to residents groups in areas affected by thefts, and Garda members keep injured parties appraised as to the status of investigations at all times.</p></reply>

Section 3(3) provides that the Board shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific matters raised by the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board.  I wish firstly to clarify one aspect.  With the exception of a very small number of more vulnerable cases (such as those relating to domestic violence, childcare, or being supported under the Abhaile scheme), clients generally pay a contribution for legal advice and a further contribution if they require representation in court.  The requirement to pay such a contribution is set out in the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 &ndash; 2017.</p>  <p>  In terms of the financial eligibility of applicants to the Legal Aid Board, applicants for legal aid are required to meet the criteria under section 29 of the Act and the relevant Regulations.  This provides that their disposable income (less certain allowances) must be below &euro;18,000 and their disposable capital (less certain allowances and excluding the value of the home in which they live) must be below &euro;100,000. </p>  <p>  The Regulations make detailed provision for what is to be taken into account as income. In particular, Regulation 13(8) provides that "&ldquo;income", in relation to an applicant, means the income which he or she may reasonably expect to receive from all sources&hellip;&rdquo; The effect of Regulation 13(8) is effectively that all income an applicant receives from whatever source must be taken into account unless it is specifically excluded.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the relevant criteria and regulations will apply to all applications made to the Board in the independent exercise of its functions and not all applicants will be of equal means. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that applicants are entitled to seek an internal review of a decision by the Legal Aid Board within one month of the date of the decision and to submit further information in support of such a review. They are also entitled to appeal the matter to an appeal committee consisting of non-executive members of the Legal Aid Board.</p>  <p>  While it is recognised that there are enormous and competing demands being made on the legal aid scheme, under Budget 2021, I have secured an increased provision of over &euro;2 million for the Legal Aid Board bringing its total funding to &euro;44.6 million for this year representing a 6% increase. At the same time, I have also asked my Department to conduct a comprehensive review of the current civil legal aid scheme in order that current issues, such as those raised by the Deputy, can be taken into account. This will include, specifically, the status of income such as the Housing Assistance Payment in the making of applications for legal aid which is a matter of current consideration by my Department.</p></reply>

All fatal shootings are deeply distressing, and I know that the local community are experiencing real trauma as a result of these events.</p>  <p>  As is the case in every incident involving a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that results in the death of a person, the shooting is of course being fully and independently investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), which is chaired by a High Court Judge, the Hon Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring. </p>  <p>  Such incidents are very rare in Ireland but all are fully investigated independently. GSOC have written to my Department to confirm that they have begun a criminal investigation under section 98 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005. As the Deputy may be aware, GSOC can make wider systemic recommendations on issues they investigate and they are free to do that in this instance also.  </p>  <p>  I know that Garda&iacute; have also been engaging with the local community with regard to the trauma caused by the incident, and family liaison officers from both GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are available to the Nkencho family. </p>  <p>  At the same time, Garda&iacute; are investigating the incidents at Hartstown Shopping Centre and the events leading to the shooting. There are well established protocols in place between GSOC and the Garda&iacute; to allow these parallel but separate investigations to take place.</p></reply>

This was one of a number of key issues I discussed with the Garda Commissioner and his senior team when I met with them late last year.  I have also discussed this important issue with the Garda Associations.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to ensuring that members exposed to a traumatic incident receive the appropriate organisational response. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also committed to supporting victims and witnesses when a traumatic incident occurs. However it is aware that sometimes more support is needed than the organisation can offer.  Therefore, when a crime is reported, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will provide details of independent victim support organisations. These organisations help anyone affected by crime &ndash; not just victims and witnesses, but their friends, family and other people caught up in the aftermath.</p><p>Internally within an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is recognised that the continued wellbeing of each member is essential from a personal level and contributes to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Organisation.</p><p>I can also inform the Deputy that there are twenty eight Victim Service Offices &ndash; one for each operational Garda Division.  These Offices supplement victim support activity already being undertaken by investigating members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The Offices are staffed by dedicated, specially trained personnel operating to a Standard Operating Procedure.  Their role is to keep victims informed of all significant developments associated with their case, as well as provide contact details for relevant support and counselling services.</p><p>A list of Victim Service Offices and contact details can be found at the following link.</p><p><i></i></p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Employee Assistance Service within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides a confidential professional support service to both serving and retired personnel of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, students, reserves, their families and retired members of external police services and their immediate families resident in the State. It is a proactive response by the organisation to support personnel in managing and resolving personal difficulties at an early stage, which will assist in maintaining their health and wellbeing.</p><p>The service is available to help resolve work and personal issues, including mental health, which may be causing stress, worry or disruption to an individual&rsquo;s life.  The Service is under the remit of Human Resources and People Development, and managed by a Superintendent.  There are sixteen full time staff attached to the unit with an additional two positions to be filled in the near future.Each Employee Assistance Officer has completed a Diploma in Employee Assistance and Social Support delivered by NUI Galway.</p><p>The Employee Assistance Service is supported by a Peer Supporter Network, which was established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1994 in an attempt to negate the potential harmful effects of traumatic incidents.  Peer supporters are colleagues who have received appropriate training in helping members cope with the effect of a traumatic incident in the workplace.  Very often in circumstances of traumatic incidents the immediate notification to and response from a peer supporter has had a huge impact in assisting colleagues in the aftermath of such occurrences.  Peer Supporters are available in all Garda Districts and are activated following a traumatic incident.</p><p>All Employee Assistance Officers, and approximately 250 Peer supporters, are trained in Critical Incident Stress Management.  This is an integrated planned policy designed to prevent or mitigate any adverse psychological reactions that may affect members who are exposed to a traumatic incident.  This intervention is delivered by the Employee Assistance Service along with a mental health professional when required.  </p><p>Following each traumatic incident, a peer supporter is activated.  He or she will contact the member and offer support.  In the event that the peer supporter deems it appropriate, they may refer the member to the Garda Employee Assistance Service.  If the Garda Employee Assistance Officer believes that external professional assistance is required the member can be  referred to the 24 hour, 365 day Helpline and Counselling Service and the Occupational Health Department.</p><p>Since 24 June 2016, a 24 hour 365 day Independent Helpline and Counselling Service is available to all staff within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This service is available for both work and personal difficulties.  The service is provided by Inspire Wellbeing and is confidential, free and self-referral.</p><p>Under the most recent contract awarded to Inspire Wellbeing, a new 2 tier system is available which includes:</p><p>-  Solution Focus Based Therapy for life and work events</p><p>-  Trauma Focussed based Counselling, delivered by qualified trauma counsellors.</p></reply>

These include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, Revenue, the Chief State Solicitors Office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Courts. It should be noted that in some cases, funds seized represent overdue/unpaid personal taxation. </p><p>I understand that, in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2016, the Criminal Justice Act 1994, as amended, and SI No. 418/2011 - Finance (Transfer of DepartmentalAdministration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011, all confiscations relating to the proceeds of crime are transferred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to be paid into, or disposed of, for the benefit of the Exchequer.

Work on the relevant legislative changes is at an advanced stage with a view to introducing the proposed changes shortly.

I am working with my colleagues and with our partners to ensure we have an appropriate collective national response that supports victims and holds perpetrators to account.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that restricted movement in the context of the pandemic poses an increased risk of domestic abuse, evidenced by figures reported by frontline services. This was a key concern for Government when considering the potential impact of restricting movements, and back in March, my Department developed an inter-agency plan prioritising tackling domestic abuse, raising awareness of the risks and providing extra support for victims during this very difficult period.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided additional resources, support, enforcement and services which will continue to be made available throughout the pandemic. Domestic abuse cases are being prioritised by the Garda&iacute;, through Operation Faoiseamh, by the Courts and by the Legal Aid Board. </p>  <p>  Covid specific funding to assist organisations working in this area in 2020 is being maintained and increased under Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  Both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department have publicised the fact that the Covid related travel restrictions do not apply to persons who are at risk or are removing themselves from a domestic abuse situation.  This is to ensure victims are aware of this fact and know that Garda&iacute; will support them at any checkpoint they encounter, regardless of their distance from home.  </p>  <p>  While Tusla has responsibility for funding frontline services for victims of domestic abuse, my Department provides funding for initiatives aimed at combatting domestic abuse and sexual violence and also provides funding to promote and assist the development of support services to victims of crime, which includes victims of domestic and sexual crime. </p>  <p>  This year I have secured funding of  &euro;4.104 million to support victims of crime and some &euro;3 million for raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. These figures reflect the additional &euro;2.3 million provided in Budget 2021 for implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that this Government is not just working collectively to address the immediate challenges posed by the pandemic, but is also working together to improve how we deliver supports and services to domestic abuse victims going forward. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to prioritise all aspects of our work to combat domestic abuse and to address the needs of victims, both through short term measures and working with my colleagues to evaluate and improve how we do this in the longer-term.</p></reply>

All visa applicants are advised that the onus is on them to provide as much information in support of their application as they feel is necessary.

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with legislation. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment of the applicant. All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.</p>  <p>  Due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic, I have provided six extensions of immigration permission to 20 April 2021, to ensure that those requiring an immigration permission to work in the state could continue to do so including those providing frontline services. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to announce earlier this week that a temporary system is now in place that will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Under the temporary new system, up to 4000 qualifying applicants will be asked to complete a statutory declaration that will be sent to them by email from the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department and bring it to one of the listed designated officials. The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division. Final processing will then take place and a certificate of naturalisation, will be sent to the applicant.</p>  <p>  The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March. A significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers who have made extraordinary contributions during the pandemic will also benefit from these new arrangements over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. Since their establishment in 2011, citizenship ceremonies have been joyous occasions which mark the granting of Irish citizenships in a dignified manner and they have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured.</p></reply>

This 5-level framework sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.</p>  <p>  The public health measures recognise the need to reduce congregation and interactions between people to reduce the transmission of Covid-19. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. </p>  <p>  At level 5, people are required to stay at home except for travel for work, education or other essential purposes, and will be permitted to take exercise within 5km of home.  Information relating to domestic travel at this time is available on the Government website at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/2dc71-level-5/#travel-restrictions.</p>  <p>  At level 5 non-essential retail, and all non-essential services must remain closed.

On 18 September 2020, the NCPE completed its assessment and recommended that Voretigene neparvovec not be considered for reimbursement unless cost effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report will be reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations which took place in November 2020 and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE advises that Voretigene neparvovec is expected to be included on a Drugs Group agenda in early 2021.</p>  <p>  The HSE Executive Management Team is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013 and it will, following receipt of the outcome of the Drugs Group's deliberations, make the decision on whether Voretigene neparvovec will be reimbursed.</p>  <p>  A National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018) was launched by the Minister for Health in July 2014. Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented.</p>  <p>  In December 2013 the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established as a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The opening of the National Rare Disease Office, (NRDO) in 2015 was a significant milestone for people living with a rare disease, their families and their healthcare professionals. </p>  <p>  On foot of the HSE Chief Clinical Officer&rsquo;s (CCO) review of all the national clinical programmes in April 2019, it was recommended that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases be operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office.  From 1 September 2020, the NRDO has become the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO will be overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations. This means that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases is being wound down and any outstanding projects transferred to the NRDO.  </p>  <p>  Building on the significant progress to date, a number of themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI).  </p>  <p>  In addition, a number of key themes have been identified for future progress, including: Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education and Training and Legislation and Policy.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department and further information is available here: . </p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles will be vaccinated in Group 2. This includes HCWs working in public, private, and voluntary settings. Other HCWs, not in direct patient contact, will be vaccinated in Group 4.</p><p>Family carers are a diverse group, therefore, each individual will be vaccinated in the group that is appropriate to them. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

Validation is the process whereby hospital administration contacts patients on waiting lists at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend a hospital appointment or wish to be removed from the waiting list. </p><p>For a number of years validation was conducted at individual hospital level in Ireland but in 2018 the Minister for Health approved the establishment of the National Centralised Validation Unit (NCVU) within the NTPF. The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across hospitals and across IPDC and OPD waiting lists. </p><p>The NCVU advised my Department that the validation of the waiting list process, which had been suspended at the end of March due to COVID-19, recommenced on 7th August.

In particular, people in the over-75 age category presenting to EDs are more likely to have complex needs and require admission to hospital than the population generally. Nevertheless, the National Service Plan 2020 includes an expected activity target that 99% of patients aged 75 and over attending at an Emergency Department be discharged or admitted within 24 hours and any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The HSE Winter Plan, supported by an additional &euro;600m invested in health services, aims to reduce the number of patients waiting on trolleys for hospital admission and reduce Emergency Department waiting times while ensuring that patients and staff alike are protected in the Covid-19 environment.</p>  <p>  There are specific supports in the Winter Plan for those at greater risk including older people, the homeless, and people with chronic illnesses, facilitated through additional Community Healthcare Networks, Community Specialist Teams, and Frailty Intervention Therapy Teams operating within acute hospital EDs. These measures will create the foundation and organisational structure through which integrated care will be provided locally within the community at the appropriate level of complexity. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

Despite the challenges resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, by 31st December 2020 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) had carried out 322 scoliosis procedures, 163 of which were spinal fusions, and 159 other spinal procedures. Overall, scoliosis activity figures for 2020 were 16% lower than in the previous year, despite the necessary curtailment of routine elective surgery in  March, April and May last year, significant social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements. </p>  <p>  Scoliosis activity accounts for 20% of overall orthopaedic activity across CHI. In recent years there has been an increased investment in paediatric orthopaedics and scoliosis services, which has improved access to surgery and outpatient appointments. In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. </p>  <p>  This funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTE in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively. The majority of posts were allocated to each hospital in 2018.</p>  <p>  On 2nd January 2021, the HSE issued correspondence to the Acute hospital system advising of the need to curtail scheduled elective care. This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and the projected trend in admissions based upon community transmission levels of Covid-19. CHI has advised that under the current HSE guidelines, they have reduced the number of procedures to urgent and those that are time sensitive rather than a blanket cessation of all routine activity as was done in March last year. </p>  <p>  CHI have confirmed that urgent Outpatient appointments continue to be held face to face, while some routine appointments have been deferred. Many specialties have switched to virtual appointments with some blended face to face appointments where deemed appropriate.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE have confirmed that this position will be reviewed weekly throughout January. </p>  <p>  Key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as the current two-metre distancing, have had a material impact on the available physical space to deliver services, including scoliosis procedures. However, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland have confirmed that time dependent and urgent procedures will continue to be undertaken in CHI.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised regarding the number of children currently waiting less than 4, 4 to 8 and more than 8 months, respectively in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital at the end of December 2020, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Department continues to engage, including through the Implementation Oversight Team and the Reference Group with the HSE as a nursing home provider and with the representative body for private and voluntary nursing homes on the implementation of the recommendations of the Nursing Homes Expert Panel report. </p>  <p>  As you are aware, the epidemiological situation in relation to COVID-19 has deteriorated, including in relation to nursing homes. Preliminary data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) indicates that there are over 165 open outbreaks, which is over 5 times the amount of nursing home outbreaks open in mid-December. As noted by the Expert Panel and the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), where there are high rates of community transmission, the risk to nursing homes is high. The HSE indicates that the recent changes in the incidence of COVID-19 nationally and, in particular, in nursing homes have presented significant staffing challenges across healthcare settings. The HSE is indicating that over 1,000 nursing home staff are presently absent as a result of COVID-19. As you will appreciate this is placing significant challenges on nursing homes. The HSE and HIQA are activating all of the available and established supports; however, staffing, particularly nursing staff, remains a particular challenge. Having regard to the current challenges, it is necessary to prioritise adequate levels of staffing in nursing homes, which may require the temporary redeployment of staff to other facilities to support safe care for residents. Where possible, the HSE is redeploying its own staff to other public and private nursing homes to support the safe delivery of care.  </p>  <p>  The established serial testing programme for nursing home staff remains a key support mechanism and is now in its seventh cycle. The testing programme is a critical part of the ongoing response to COVID-19 in nursing homes and allows for the early detection of cases and targeting of the early intervention of COVID-19 Response and Outbreak Control Teams. Over the coming weeks, where appropriate, the frequency of testing will be temporarily increased to a weekly basis under the guidance and advice of the relevant local HSE teams in agreement with nursing homes.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, the comprehensive range of public health and infection prevention and control advice remains to be of critical importance, including the appropriate use of PPE. The HSE and HIQA has developed and delivered comprehensive training resources and webinars for staff in relation to these matters.</p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.</p><p>The HSE has advised that it has received pricing and reimbursement applications for two indications of Dupilumab (Dupixent):</p><p>- For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>- For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>The HSE received an application for pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab in November 2017 from the manufacturer for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 29 November 2017 as per agreed processes.  This assessment was completed on 12 December 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Dupilumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p><p>Subsequently, the HSE received an application for the pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab on 13 December 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>The HSE commissioned the rapid review process on the 17 December 2019. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p><p>The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p><p>The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p><p>The final HTA report and NCPE recommendations concerning Dupilumab were reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of the commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p><p>The HSE confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to this application.</p><p>The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Health Act, and engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission.</p><p>The HSE has advised that the HSE Drugs Group, having reviewed the above representations at their January 2021 meeting, supported reimbursement of Dupilumab for a defined subgroup of the full licensed indication. The Drugs Group recommendations have been progressed to the HSE EMT.</p><p>The HSE EMT will consider the HSE Drugs Group's recommendations and the applicant&rsquo;s representations before making a final decision on whether Dupilumab will be approved for reimbursement, in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This comprehensive and far-reaching piece of legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a wide range of practices, including altruistic domestic surrogacy. The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  The provisions relating to surrogacy are outlined in Part 6 of the General Scheme. These provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority. The General Scheme also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). </p>  <p>  In addition, under the surrogacy provisions at least one of the intending parents will have to be genetically related to the child. Surrogacy will be permitted on an altruistic basis where the payment of defined and receiptable reasonable expenses will be allowed. However, commercial surrogacy in Ireland will be prohibited as it raises a number of concerns relating to the welfare and commodification of the children involved as well as the potential risks of coercion and exploitation of financially vulnerable women to act as surrogates.</p>  <p>  As we continue to deal with the challenge of responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, delays have occurred in progressing normal workstreams in the Department; however, drafting of the Bill is ongoing in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. The publication of the Bill is a priority for Government and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>Overall, the provisions outlined within the General Scheme will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight. The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers), while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR is the key principle underpinning the General Scheme.</p></reply>

The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in front-line services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles will be vaccinated in Group 2. This includes HCWs working in public, private, and voluntary settings. Other HCWs, not in direct patient contact, will be vaccinated in Group 4.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.</p></reply>

As part of our response to these challenges, the Department of Health has provided guidance and support for people to manage both their physical and mental wellbeing and to stay connected. This guidance has been provided through public health information campaigns, such as our In This Together Campaign, and through information networks including key organisations working with vulnerable people.  </p>  <p>  Following on from the In This Together, campaign, in November of last year the Department of Health launched the &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign, which is aimed at supporting our citizens through the difficult winter months ahead. Significant funds are being invested into this new initiative, with &euro;7 million to support the delivery of a range of actions and support services, which will be rolled out over the coming months. </p>  <p>  The campaign will encourage us all to do something that is good for us each day or week, like going for a walk, connecting safely with friends or family, engaging in a hobby or reaching out for the supports that we may need. By doing so, we will create balance, routine and resilience.  The campaign is focused on five main themes, which include Staying Connected and Minding your Mood.   </p>  <p>  The Staying Connected theme addresses isolation, supporting volunteerism and initiatives that support person-to-person connection which is important to our wellbeing. Isolation of people of all ages is a significant risk during the COVID pandemic, particularly during periods of tight restrictions on movement and social interaction. The Community Call programme was introduced in mid-2020 to provide local helplines through Local Authorities for practical supports, information sharing and befriending. As part of the &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign, this programme will be significantly expanded to be proactive in outreach to potentially isolated persons. Working with partner organisations, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, NGOs and Volunteer Ireland, there will be a particular emphasis on identifying and supporting those most at risk of isolation. </p>  <p>  Under the Minding your Mood theme, people will be equipped with information on where to go if they need support. This will also be linked with the local community helpline to ensure that people can access the help they need. The HSE recently launched a series of &ldquo;Minding Your Wellbeing&rdquo; online videos, which provides an opportunity for people to learn more about key elements of mental wellbeing such as mindfulness, gratitude, self-care and resilience.  Additionally, the Children and Young Peoples&rsquo; Services Committees are rolling out supports for children, young people and families. </p>  <p>  There are also free, 24/7 services available through the Samaritans and Crisis Text Line Ireland. Details of these services and more are listed on the HSE website, www.yourmentalhealth.ie, and information on available services is also provided through the free mental health telephone information line, 1800 111888. ALONE, in collaboration with the Department of Health and HSE, is also running a national support line which is open Monday to Friday, 8am-8pm at 0818 222 024.</p>  <p>  The clear message is that, whatever people are going through in terms of reduced social contacts, loneliness or isolation, we should all stay as connected and as healthy as possible, helping to strengthen community and individual resilience, restoring hope that we can and will recover, and make it through this, together. </p>  <p>  The current restrictions in place are no doubt be challenging for all of us, but particularly those living alone.  With this in mind, measures include a 'social bubble' to support those who risk isolation.</p>  <p>  People in certain categories can form a support bubble with one other household.  Those who can form a support bubble include: those alone with children under the age of 18, those living alone, those sharing parenting or custody arrangements, those living with an adult to whom they provide care, and those who live alone and have a carer or carers who supports them.</p>  <p>  A change in the way we live our lives on such a scale as this has demanded a whole of government response. Additional interventions include funding for the senior alert scheme delivered by Pobal, which enables older people to live securely in their homes through the provision of personal monitored alarms. The Department of Community and Rural Development and the Islands as part of its Covid-19 action plan has increased supports to older people through a befriending phone call initiative which will support participants in the senior alert scheme, which is operated in conjunction with Pobal and Alone.</p></reply>

Following a pause in the steps towards full establishment to allow for discussions with the 221+ Patient Representative Group in respect of the Tribunal and CervicalCheck Cases generally, I appointed the nominated members to the tribunal with effect from 1 December 2020 enabling the tribunal to start its work.</p>  <p>  My Department worked with the 221+ group to progress issues they had raised in respect of the CervicalCheck Tribunal and CervicalCheck cases, with significant progress made through meetings and correspondence on a number of issues. It was not possible to resolve all of the issues raised by the group in the way that they wanted them to be addressed, however, these issues were broader than the tribunal, applying to CervicalCheck cases more generally. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my Department to address the concerns the group have raised where possible and while there is no ongoing engagement with the group in respect of the tribunal, I am available to meet with them, and engagement continues with my Department through other mechanisms such as the CervicalCheck Steering Committee.</p>  <p>  Two particular issues of concern raised by the group regarding the CervicalCheck Tribunal and CervicalCheck cases relate to the statute of limitations and access to the Tribunal in the event of a recurrence of cancer.</p>  <p>  The group raised a concern that some women eligible for the Tribunal may now be outside the Statute of Limitations as a result of the delay in establishing the Tribunal, which was due to the global pandemic and issues with regard to Tribunal membership. It was not possible to address this concern by extending the statute of limitations retrospectively; as advised by the Attorney General however, I have received Cabinet approval to develop a proposal to address any such claims, should they arise. I have written to the Group informing them of the government's commitment and that I am willing to discuss this with them.</p>  <p>  In respect of how the Tribunal will deal with the issue of recurrence, this issue has been examined in great detail by the government as well as the previous government and I have engaged in extensive consideration on this most sensitive issue. The Tribunal will make awards relating to recurrence in the same way as the High Court. That is, an additional amount can be made as part of the Tribunal settlement, to factor in a future chance of recurrence.  An advantage of the Tribunal over the courts is that, if a claimant does not wish to accept the amount awarded by the Tribunal, they can appeal to the High Court, an extra step that would not be available if the claimant had gone directly to the High Court. However, just like the Court system, a claimant cannot return with a second claim in respect of the same event years later.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the CervicalCheck Tribunal remains the most appropriate venue for CervicalCheck claims. It is, of course, entirely up to the women affected as to whether or not they want to use it.  </p></reply>

This guidance, which includes protocols relating to the management of close contacts, is available at </p><p> </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that schools must have a Covid-19 Response Plan and a Covid policy in place. Up-to-date Government advice and resources for schools, parents and students in the context of COVID-19, including advice on Covid-19 planning is published at </p><p>.</p><p>Where a school is informed of a pupil or staff member who has tested positive for Covid-19, if the case was in the school during the infectious period, the HSE endeavour to contact school management the same day, although this may be the following day in some cases. When public health doctors make contact with the school, they will proceed to undertake a Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA). Core to the PHRA will be assessing the likelihood of onward transmission from the case identified, and this will inform their further actions. The risk assessment applied in school settings may be dynamic and change as new information becomes available, and the testing strategy may evolve as information unfolds.</p><p>The Health Service Executive has adopted RNA PCR as the gold standard test for diagnosing Covid-19 cases, as part of the HSE test and trace strategy, consistent with international best practice, and approved by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. </p><p>It should be noted that testing for Sars-Cov2 does not confirm that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. The HSE has worked intensively over the last number of months to put in place a comprehensive testing and tracing operation and despite the very significant increase in demand over the last number of weeks, the median time for community referral to appointment is 0.8 days with 92.5% of GP referrals provided with a COVID-19 test appointment within 24 hours. While the automatic referral of close contacts for testing is generally paused on a temporary basis, close contacts in outbreak and school settings continue to be referred for a test. </p><p>While rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) are described as rapid, and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers. RADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, particularly where there is swabbing capacity on-site, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population. Validation studies, both here in Ireland and in Europe are showing significant disparities in sensitivity and specificity of tests versus manufacturer claims. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic patients is much better than in asymptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients, sensitivity results are being shown to be below the minimum performance requirements set by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team has endorsed recommendations on the use of Rapid Antigen Detection Tests (RADTs) as a supplement to PCR testing in certain situations, and particularly when the availability of PCR tests may be limited. The HSE is currently considering the use of RADTs for diagnosis of symptomatic persons and their close contacts in PCR confirmed outbreaks, and / or symptomatic persons where there is a high suspicion of an outbreak, pending PCR confirmation, if faster presumptive results will inform public health action. </p><p>On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

Conducting on-farm inspections is deemed essential work. Officials in my Department and I are very conscious of the challenges and concerns for all stakeholders posed by the COVID-19 situation. At all times, our priority is to safeguard the health and safety of farm families, our staff and the wider community, while still facilitating scheme payments. Where possible, inspections are being done remotely, thereby avoiding the need for on-farm visits but in certain situations, a farm visit is required in order to complete the pre-payment checks and controls necessary to make vital payments to these farmers. </p>  <p>  Inspections are carried out in line with HSE guidelines and Government requirements concerning COVID. All inspections are notified in advance and the farmer is afforded an opportunity to defer the inspection for up to three weeks should there be COVID related concerns or issues. In addition, inspectors are required to adhere to an inspection protocol which gives clear guidance to inspectors on procedures to be followed during the inspection. We cannot defer inspections indefinitely as this would impact payments to scheme participants. </p></reply>

There are distinct and specific statutory functions assigned to the officials delivering the appeals service which require the Appeals Officers and the Director to be independent in the performance of their functions when making determinations on appeals. </p>  <p> Appeals Officers are appointed in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 and have a wide range of experience within various roles.  In 2018, the Agriculture Appeals Office was assigned responsibility for implementing a new statutory appeals service for appeals against Department decisions on forestry licences. The Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) also operates independently of my Department.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that the Office is currently experiencing delays in dealing with agriculture and forestry appeals due to an increase in the volume of appeals received.</p>  <p>  The number of agriculture appeals submitted to the Office in 2020 was 34% higher than the number submitted in 2019. In addition, the holding of oral hearings for agriculture appeals, which appellants may request under the Agriculture Appeals legislation, was suspended last March due to restrictions put in place to deal with COVID-19. Hearings were resumed in the latter part of 2020 but had to be suspended again due to further restrictions being put in place.  I understand that the Office is now holding oral hearings remotely for agriculture appeals and appellants have been contacted by the Office in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Since the Forestry Appeals Committee was established, the number of appeals has increased significantly year on year. In 2020, there were 874 appeals submitted to the FAC compared to 489 in 2019.  </p>  <p>  Additional resources were provided to the Office in the 3rd quarter of 2020 to cater for the backlog of agriculture and forestry appeals. The current staff allocation is one Director, one Deputy Director, 14 Appeals Officers and 13 administrative support staff.  The staff undertake duties in relation to both Agriculture Appeals and Forestry Appeals. All Appeals Officers are members of the FAC. Up to November 2020, there was one Forestry Appeals Committee hearing forestry appeals. There are now four divisions of the Forestry Appeals Committee hearing such appeals to provide a more efficient service and these are made up of external members and Appeals Officers. </p>  <p>  With regard to the appeal to which you refer that was submitted to the Office four months ago, I understand that this has now been assigned to an Appeals Officer for determination and the appellant will be contacted in due course. </p>  <p>  You also refer to an appeal that was submitted almost a year ago. I have been advised by the Office that a decision was issued by the Appeals Officer dealing with this appeal and, following the issuing of this decision, there was a request for a review of the Appeals Officer's decision received from the appellant in February 2020. </p>  <p>  Reviews of decisions of Appeals Officers can only be undertaken by the Director of the Appeals Office in accordance with the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001. I am advised that there has been a significant increase in the number of reviews sought in the past few years which has led to delays in completing the reviews. </p>  <p>  I am assured that the Office is making every effort to deal with the backlog of both forestry and agriculture appeals through the assignment of additional resources in 2020 and the holding of remote hearings. </p></reply>

I am in regular and intensive consultation with all stakeholders to resolve these issues and I also issue a weekly dashboard to update on my Department's licensing dashboard. I have received the correspondence to which the question refers and a direct response will issue from my office to the person concerned. </p>  <p>  It is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy, including our important hardware sector which services both the local and export market. I know too that licensing is key to meeting our environmental objectives under the Climate Action Plan and in terms of biodiversity, as outlined in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  You will be aware of the delays caused by changes to the licensing system which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input in order to comply with environmental requirements. We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan. We have invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added in 2021. This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and the last quarter of 2020 saw the highest number of licences issued last year. </p>  <p>  The total number of licences which issued in 2020 was 2,593, of which, 1,719 were tree felling licences.  The total volume of felling licences issued for 2020 was just over 5 million cubic metres, of which almost 2m cubic metres representing 40% of annual output issued in the latter months of the year. This positive trend is continuing this month, with 177 licences issued in the first two weeks of January, which includes timber volume of nearly 450,000 m3.  The aim is to sustain and build substantially on that output and ensure the consistent high level of output that the sector needs.  </p>  <p>  We have also implemented changes to the functioning of the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. The FAC is now hearing an average of 60 licences per month representing an increase of 150 percent.  The FAC in consultation with the Agriculture Appeals Office is currently reviewing ways in which greater efficiency can be achieved across the four divisions of the FAC.  I would like to note that the FAC has appeals on 189 tree felling licences on hand and have issued decisions for appeals on 95 felling licences since 1st October, 2020.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved. </p></reply>

In this regard, my Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations. These supports include funding to carry out applied research through the National Apiculture Programme, grants to national beekeeping associations and grant aid to fund capital investments for beekeepers. My Department has funded a number of studies under the Genetic Research Grant Aid Scheme looking at various aspects of this honeybee species and specifically apis mellifera mellifera.

In 2020, my Department published new national Recognition Criteria under the CMO to be satisfied by applicants for recognition.  In line with the commitments in our Programme for Government to facilitate formation of Producer Organisations in the inshore fisheries sector, the new Recognition Criteria were introduced to make it easier for inshore fisheries producer groups to achieve recognition as a PO.  Producer Organisation status has many advantages, including better negotiating strength in the market for producers, financial supports under my Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme and certain protections under EU competition law.</p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department received an application from the group named.  The CMO Regulation provides for a timeframe of three months within which to determine an application for recognition, subject to receipt of all necessary information.  On 15 July 2020, my Department wrote to the group named  requesting additional information to assist in consideration of their application.  They responded on some of the issues concerned, but a response is awaited on some others.  These relate to organisational and procedural matters.  Pending receipt of that information, consideration of the application is paused.  My officials have discussed the status of the application with the group on a number of occasions and remain available to provide any additional guidance needed. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government commitments, I also introduced new financial supports in 2020 under my Department&rsquo;s EMFF Programme, making available to producer groups seeking recognition grants for IT equipment, office furniture, legal, accountancy and other relevant professional advice, website development costs and costs of room hire etc.</p></reply>

Under the new designations, Ros a Mh&iacute;l and Howth will be able to accommodate landings of demersal stocks from vessels under 26 metres and will operate Monday to Friday from 10am to 10pm.  Greencastle, Rathmullen and Burtonport will be designated for non-quota species landings from vessels under 18 metres and will operate from 2pm to 8pm from Monday to Friday.  </p>  <p>  From 1st January 2021, the United Kingdom is a third country and subject to IUU legislation and NEAFC requirements. This means that any UK registered vessel, including any Northern Ireland registered vessel, must comply with third country landing requirements when landing in the EU, including Irish ports. This is a direct result of Brexit and included in the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. Up until the conclusion of EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on Christmas Eve, it remained unclear whether Northern Ireland vessels that had access to Irish waters would continue to have such access.</p>  <p>  The designation of extra Irish ports for landings by Northern Ireland vessels is an important decision, which will allow fishers in small vessels to continue their livelihoods following Brexit. It is important now more than ever, to support our fishers and fishing communities and to do all we can do help them continue their livelihoods.  I am working to make sure the necessary notifications and requirements are in place to have these ports operational from 1st February 2021.</p>  <p>  Any UK-Northern Ireland registered boats landing into any of the seven Irish ports will have to comply with additional documentary and procedural requirements as a result of Brexit.  Designation of ports is within the State&rsquo;s authority, but all requirements and protocols are subject to EU and international law and must be strictly adhered to to gain entry to ports.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations. These supports include funding to carry out applied research through the National Apiculture Programme, grants to national beekeeping associations and grant aid to fund capital investments for beekeepers.

It is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy and to help achieve our environmental goals.</p><p>You will be aware of the delays caused by changes to the licensing system, which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input in order to comply with environmental requirements.  We are tackling these delays by means of a systematic project plan.  We have invested heavily in resources including the recruitment of additional ecologists, forestry inspectorate and administrative staff, with extra resources to be added in 2021.  This has already resulted in an increase in the number of licences issued, and the last quarter of 2020 saw the highest number of licences issued last year.  </p><p>The total number of licences which issued in 2020 was 2,593.  Over 4,300ha of new afforestation and 129km of forest roads were licensed.  The total volume of felling licences issued for 2020 was just over 5 million cubic metres, of which almost 2m cubic metres representing 40% of annual output issued in the last quarter of the year.  This positive trend is continuing this month, with 177 licences issued in the first two weeks of January, which includes timber volume of nearly 450,000 m<sup>3</sup>.  The aim is to sustain and build substantially on that output and ensure the consistent high level of output that the sector needs.</p><p>Furthermore,  we have also implemented changes to the functioning of the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry Act 2020. I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. The FAC is now hearing an average of 60 licences per month representing an increase of 150 percent.  The FAC in consultation with the Agriculture Appeals Office is currently reviewing ways in which greater efficiency can be achieved across the four divisions of the FAC.</p><p>On 1st October we had 4,832 applications on hand for processing. We have issued 1,045 new licences since then and currently have 4,453 licences on hand for processing when new applications received since are included. A breakdown of these figures is below. </p><p><i>Felling:</i>There were 3,230 tree felling applications on hand at 1<sup>st</sup>October. 2020; 2,760 felling licences  are on hand at present; 774 have been licensed since 1st October at a volume of 2.424m cubic metres.  Since 1st October 29 felling licence decisions have been appealed for 474ha/124,803m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p><i>Forest Roads:</i>There were 642 forest road applications on hand at 1<sup>st</sup>October, 2020; 684 road licences are on hand at present; 99 have been licensed since 1st October at 37.48kms. Since 1st October 10 licences  were appealed at 5.2km.</p><p><i>Afforestation</i>: There were 960 afforestation licence applications on hand on 1<sup>st</sup>October, 2020; 1,009 afforestation licences are on hand at present, 172 have been licensed since 1st October at 1,638.75 hectares. Since 1st October 23 licences were appealed totalling 306ha.</p><p>On the question of appeals received since 1st October, 62 licences have been appealed since that date.  </p><p>In conclusion I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.  </p></reply>

In 2020, the volume estimated was 3.9m cubic metres and 4.1m cubic metres is estimated for 2021.  The actual amount harvested in 2018, which is the last year for which data is available was 3.6m cubic metres.  My Department issued tree felling licences for a total volume of 5.023m cubic metres in 2020.  There are currently 2,760 tree felling licence applications on hand, covering approx. 15,000 ha, and a further 189 awaiting a decision by the FAC (3,400 ha approx), which will provide a steady supply of timber.</p>  <p>  The target for new afforestation in 2021 is 8,000 ha, as set out in the Climate Action Plan 2019.  In 2020, my Department issued afforestation licences for 4,342ha of afforestation and 2,433ha of new afforestation was planted. Afforestation licences have a three-year validity and my Department estimates a total of 4,900ha is available for planting with a valid afforestation licence and not subject to appeal.  I would encourage licence holders to plant afforestation and to benefit from the grants and generous annual premiums that are available.  At present, my Department has 1,009 afforestation applications on hand for 4,500ha approx. and there are a further 90 awaiting a decision by the FAC (1,100ha approx.).</p>  <p>  The positive increase in licensing in Q4 of 2020 has continued with 177 licences issued in the first two weeks of January which includes timber volume of nearly 450,000 m3.  The aim is to sustain and build substantially on that output and ensure the consistent high level of output that the sector needs. Since  1st October, we have now issued 1,045 new licences and we aim to grow this output further. </p>  <p>  Resolving these licensing issues is a top priority of mine and no effort is being spared in my Department to fix them. I remain confident that the steps taken in 2020, and the additional resources available into 2021, will yield the results required to support the forestry industry for the years ahead.</p></reply>

After exchanges between DFA and the UK Task Force, it was clarified in November that, in line with the Northern Ireland protocol, landings by Northern Ireland vessels would be treated as landings by third country vessels for the purposes of  Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) legislation and North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC);  that Northern Ireland vessels landing into Irish ports would not be subject to Sanitary &amp;amp; Phytosanitary (SPS) requirements and that Irish vessels landing into Northern Ireland ports would have to land in NEAFC designated ports. A link to the readiness notice was published on my Department's website and on the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) website to ensure that the notice was readily available for members of the Irish fishing industry.</p>  <p>  However, up until the conclusion of EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on Christmas Eve, it remained unclear whether Northern Ireland vessels that had access to Irish waters would continue to have such access.</p>  <p>  The SFPA submitted papers on 25th September and 10th December to my Department on the designation of third country ports, firstly looking at potential designation of ports around Ireland and then more specifically at a third country port designation in North Donegal, namely Greencastle.  Given the significant practical and cost implications for the State in the designation of EU ports for Third Country landings because under EU Regulations such designations represent an entry point to the European Union following which food is free to circulate within the full EU common market, the SFPA did not recommend designation of third country ports at this time.  In any ports designated, Ireland is obliged to ensure that it has in place a meaningful control presence. </p>  <p>  I met with the SFPA on 25th November 2020, where this matter was discussed. I met with the SFPA again on 8th and 13th January 2021 to discuss designations. Following on from this consultation with the SFPA, I have decided to designate five additional Irish ports, for both IUU and NEAFC purposes, to accept UK registered-Northern Ireland vessel landings.</p>  <p>  The five new ports designated are Ros a Mh&iacute;l, Howth, Greencastle, Rathmullen and Burtonport and join Killybegs and Castletownbere which continue to be designated for landings from vessels of any third country origin. Under the new designations, Ros a Mh&iacute;l and Howth will be able to accommodate landings of whitefish and prawn from vessels under 26 metres and will operate Monday to Friday from 10am to 10pm.  Greencastle, Rathmullen and Burtonport will be designated for non-quota species landings from vessels under 18 metres and will operate from 2pm to 8pm from Monday to Friday.  </p>  <p>  From 1st January 2021, the United Kingdom is a third country and subject to IUU legislation and NEAFC requirements. This means that any UK registered vessel, including any Northern Ireland registered vessel, must comply with third country landing requirements when landing in the EU, including Irish ports. This is a direct result of Brexit and included in the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The designation of extra Irish ports is an important decision, which will allow fishers in small vessels to continue their livelihoods in a safe manner following Brexit. It is important now more than ever, to support our fishers and fishing communities and to do all we can do help them continue their livelihoods.  I am working to make sure the necessary notifications and requirements are in place to have these ports operational from Monday, 1 February 2021.</p>  <p>  Any UK-Northern Ireland registered boats landing into any of the seven Irish ports will have to comply with additional documentary and procedural requirements as a result of Brexit.  Designation of ports is within the State&rsquo;s authority, but all requirements and protocols are subject to EU and international law and must be strictly adhered to to gain entry to ports.</p></reply>

Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/262, which came into effect on 1 January 2016, lays down the rules governing the identification of equidae. This legislation was transposed into national legislation in Ireland via the European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations (S.I. No 62 of 2016)(as amended). This sets down the rules regarding the identification of equines for owners/keepers of equines who are responsible for their identification.  </p>  <p>  Enforcement of equine identification legislation is primarily undertaken by authorised officers throughout my Department's Regional Office network and at slaughter plants. These officers work closely with their veterinary colleagues across the various Local Authorities and liaise with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Commissioners Officials, as required. Authorised officers from my Department engage in checks at sales venues including marts and fairs, as well as at horse slaughter plants and at export points including ports and airports. Similarly, potential equine welfare and abandonment issues are dealt with by authorised officers of my Department in conjunction with authorised officers from other agencies.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide for additional urban horse welfare programmes. The Department continues to take a proactive approach in tackling challenges by developing facilities for urban horse populations and in educating young people among these communities in the care and welfare of horses. This work is carried out in close collaboration with Local Authorities and will be reflected in the new Animal Welfare Strategy to be launched shortly.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to people in disadvantaged areas. As an example, the DSPCA with financial assistance from the Department, continues to facilitate castration and ID clinics and education programmes in an effort to address the problem of over-breeding which can add to welfare issues. </p>  <p>  The Control of Horses Act, 1996 is currently under review within the Department and plans for replacement legislation are well advanced.  The Department will be further engaging with stakeholders on this . Under the Act, Local Authorities may take a range of actions in relation to equines including prohibiting horses in certain areas, the issuing of licences, the seizure of horses in contravention of the Act.  These powers can be used in respect of straying horses which includes horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission, including public land.  The Local Authorities may also prosecute offenders under this Act. </p>  <p>  The Department continues to support other agencies and Local Authorities in enforcing the law. </p></reply>

In response to the difficulties being experienced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed a CSP Support Fund during 2020 totalling &euro;4.75m which assists all CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll and also provides assistance for the Employers PRSI contribution, during this crisis period up to April 2021.</p>  <p>  The 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) was launched in June 2020 with funding of &euro;2m and provides small capital grants to community organisations.  Separately, with funding from the July stimulus package, my Department launched a &euro;5m fund under the CEP for repairs or upgrades to community centres and community buildings.  While it is now closed for 2020, it is hoped to run the CEP again in 2021. </p>  <p>  More recently my Department launched a &euro;1.7m COVID-19 Emergency Fund, which local community and voluntary groups can apply for by contacting the Local Community Development Committee in their area.  This follows on from a previous &euro;2.5m round of this fund.  </p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department launched the &euro;45m COVID 19 Stability Fund for organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises. Funding of &euro;44m has been approved to just under 600 organisations to date and the payment processes for this funding remain ongoing. The Stability Fund is now closed for further applications.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Community and Voluntary sector,  Local Authorities and Local Development Companies, to support community organisations across the country as they deal with the ongoing and emerging challenges presented by COVID-19.  I would encourage all groups to engage with their Local Authority and Local Development Company so that they are aware of funding opportunities as they become available. </p>  <p>  Information on all funding available through my Department can be found on my Department's website.</p></reply>

This consultation was carried out through structured public meetings on the islands.  The consultation process had to be temporarily suspended during 2020 due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and to avoid health risks, both for the island communities and Departmental officials.</p>  <p>  The consultation process was re-commenced through an on-line format in the final quarter of 2020 and will conclude shortly.  The Department will also consult with other key stakeholders such as Government Departments and Local Authorities through an on-line approach.</p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental Committee was established in 2019 to oversee the development of the Islands policy.  This group met on two occasions prior to the commencement of the consultation process. With the main phase of the public consultation process now coming to an end, arrangements are being made to convene a meeting of this group before the end of January.</p>  <p>  The Committee will review progress to date and consider the main messages which have emerged from the consultation process.  The scope and structure for the drafting of the new policy will also be agreed at that meeting, and the final phases of the consultation process involving discussions with individual Departments will be mapped out.  </p>  <p>  I envisage that the new Islands Policy will be published in the second half of this year.  The policy will be a significant milestone for our offshore islands and will include recommendations to support a cross-Departmental approach to the future development of the islands.</p></reply>

Category 1 relates to major capital projects that can drive sustainable rural regeneration and development, while Category 2 supports projects that require development funding to bring them to a stage where they are ready to apply under Category 1 calls.</p>  <p>  The three projects referred to by the Deputy are all being led by Clare County Council.</p>  <p>  The Iniscealtra project was approved for funding of &euro;920,500 under the second first call for Category 2 applications. Based on the periodic updates my Department seeks in relation to progress on funded projects, I understand that the Council has appointed contractors to carry out work on the visitor experience interpretation and preliminary design. </p>  <p>  The Loop Head Lighthouse was approved for funding of &euro;868,500 under the first call for Category 1 applications.  I understand the Council has commenced the waterworks for the Loophead Lighthouse and is engaged in the planning and design of the enhancement of the tourism offering within the compound of the Lighthouse. </p>  <p>  The Vandeleur Project was approved for funding of &euro;1,720,000 under the first call for Category 1 applications.  I understand the Council is currently engaged in the tender process to appoint a contractor to deliver the final project.</p>  <p>  If more detailed information is required on the progress of the above projects, I would advise the Deputy to contact the Council directly.</p></reply>

Applications are currently being assessed by my Department under the oversight of the Project Advisory Board, comprised of representatives from key Government Departments and independent experts.  Once the assessment process is complete, my Department will prepare a report setting out recommended projects and my role as Minister will be to consider that report and make final decisions in relation to the allocation of funding. </p>  <p>  In light of the foregoing, it will therefore be a number of weeks before an announcement of successful projects can take place.</p></reply>
