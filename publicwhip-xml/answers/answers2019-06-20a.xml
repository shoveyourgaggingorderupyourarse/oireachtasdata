    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-20a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062000050#WRA00600"><p>To further guide the roll-out of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. The group has to date met on five occasions. In line with the Transparency Code it is expected that the minutes of those meetings will be available on the gov.ie website shortly. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative. The more specific role and objectives of the Group are:</p>  <p>  - to provide constructive, critical feedback on the Equality Budgeting initiative to date;</p>  <p>  - to provide expert guidance and informed insights on the future direction and areas of focus for Equality Budgeting, including in light of international experience, lessons from other policy areas and from academia;</p>  <p>  - to promote a coherent, cross-government approach to Equality Budgeting, to maximise equality impacts and avoid duplication of effort across various policy areas; and </p>  <p>  - to identify existing strengths of the Irish policy-making system which can be leveraged in support of Equality Budgeting, along with potential shortcomings that need to be addressed in this regard.</p>  <p>  To allow for a focused assessment of each area, an Equality Budgeting framework was developed in the context of the 2020 Estimates process. Nine themes were identified, informed by various Government strategies currently guiding policy development across many different equality dimensions, including strategies for women and girls and for people with disabilities. The themes identified allow for sectorial examination and highlight areas where it is recognised that special policy action is required. </p>  <p>  An Equality Budgeting update was included in the recently published Public Service Performance Report 2018, which makes use of the nine equality budgeting themes. While gender equality was the primary area for attention in the early stages of Equality Budgeting, work has been ongoing to broaden the scope of the initiative to include other dimensions of equality. Nine Government departments are now actively engaged with Equality Budgeting. Work is ongoing to expand Equality Budgeting across all Government departments and address further dimensions of equality. Indeed, the Department of Justice and Equality, in close collaboration with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has recently invited experts from the OECD to conduct an "Equality Policy Scan" which will provide insights into how equality budgeting and equality policy mainstreaming can be further developed, including in light of best international practices.</p></reply>

Each project works through a lifecycle from project identification, appraisal/business case, planning &amp;amp; design, procurement, implementation, to review. </p>  <p>  The project is assessed by the Sponsoring Agency, i.e. the body delivering the project, throughout to ensure it represents value for money. At key designated stages in the lifecycle, the body funding the project, i.e. the Sanctioning Authority, is responsible for approving whether or not the project can move to the next stage.</p>  <p>  For projects estimated to cost over &euro;20 million, the Public Spending Code requires that the Sponsoring Agencies prepare an economic appraisal such as a cost benefit analysis or cost effectiveness analysis to inform their own consideration and the consideration of the project by the Sanctioning Authorities. The Public Spending Code also requires that the economic appraisals for such projects are submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;Reform for technical review. </p>  <p>  The Investment Projects &amp;amp; Programmes Office (IPPO) was set up in my Department to support the implementation of Project Ireland 2040. The IPPO conducts technical reviews as a further input for the Sanctioning Authorities. The review is policy neutral and its purpose is to support consistency in the application of the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland&rsquo;s capital management systems, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is reviewing the Public Spending Code.  The purpose of this review is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved appraisal, cost estimation and management.  The Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction procurement which will align with the updated Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The following reforms will be considered and implemented as part of the review:</p>  <p>  - Strengthen and harmonise capital appraisal guidance;</p>  <p>  - Greater clarity on governance  and roles and responsibilities, particular in terms of who is the Sanctioning Authority and who is the Sponsoring Agency for major projects;</p>  <p>  - Introduce new mechanisms to improve the accuracy of cost estimates;</p>  <p>  - Improve project life cycle to better reflect the realities of project delivery; and</p>  <p>  - Complement the Project Ireland 2040 Capital Tracker in monitoring projects and costs. </p>  <p>  The revised central elements of the Public Spending Code relating to the appraisal and management of public capital projects will be published this summer.  Further technical guidance building upon these central elements will follow in the second half of 2019 and in 2020.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-20a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062000050#WRA01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 37 together.</p>  <p>  I am happy to say that the Office of Public Works and Donegal County Council have been working constructively to address flooding issues across Donegal and I am very satisfied with the progress that has been made on the implementation of new flood relief schemes in the County since I announced, in May 2018, 29 Flood Risk Management Plans for all the main river basins.  A total of 118 flood relief projects were identified in these Plans to protect the main flood risk areas throughout the country.  15 of these projects are in County Donegal, including a proposed project to address flooding in Buncrana..</p>  <p>  These Plans and projects are a key part of the overall flood risk management strategy set out in the National Development Plan 2017 - 2028 involving total investment of almost &euro;1 billion over the ten year time frame of that Plan.  As I have mentioned in replies to previous questions on this matter, there is a significant resource commitment involved in the delivery of such an ambitious programme of investment nationally and it is not possible to implement all of the 118 projects at the one time.  Therefore it has been necessary to prioritise a total of 57 projects across different Counties for the initial tranche of investment based on the level of risk and number of properties to be protected.</p>  <p>  Following consultation and discussions between the OPW and Donegal County Council, six of the 15 Donegal projects have been identified to be progressed in the first phase of implementation.  Steering Groups for the projects have been established and much work is being done to make preparations for the appointment of consultants over the coming months for these projects. </p>  <p>  The proposed project for Buncrana is not in the initial tranche of projects to be advanced but I can assure the Deputy that the OPW and Donegal County Council will work closely to ensure that the project will be progressed as early as possible in the coming years and within the 10 year timeframe for the national programme of investment.  </p>  <p>  I am always happy to meet with residents and community groups in relation to flooding issues and I am sure that suitable arrangements can be made in that regard for Buncrana.</p></reply>

The intention of the provisions dealing with reasonable accommodation is to create a level playing field between individuals with and without a disability. </p>  <p>  Employers across the civil service provide reasonable accommodations to staff who have a disability so they can participate and advance in their employment. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available to staff and employers that can help with reasonable accommodation.</p>  <p>  - Disability Liaison Officers (DLOs) are appointed across government departments. A key part of the DLO role is to support staff with disabilities. The DLO can work in conjunction with other sections, e.g. Human Resources (HR), and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Division to assist staff with disabilities.</p>  <p>  - The Civil Service Employee Assistance Service provides a wide range of free and confidential supports to all staff and management of the Irish Civil Service.</p>  <p>  - My own Department has increased training and support aimed at ensuring civil service employers are aware of their duty of care as an employer. For example, DPER has provided:</p>  <p>  - Training on Reasonable Accommodation for over 150 people who work with staff with disabilities.</p>  <p>  - Guidelines on the provision of reasonable accommodation. </p>  <p>  In relation to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) has developed a range of applications that are used across Civil Service departments and offices for handling routine functions. These include systems for managing parliamentary questions, processing internal submissions, electronic records management, and so on.  These applications are built to be accessible for visually impaired users from the ground up.  The applications undergo accessibility testing, including the use of screen readers, the primary tool used by visually impaired users to interface with their PC. This testing, is carried out during both the development and maintenance of the applications and involves working groups with visually impaired members.  This allows the OGCIO to gather direct experience and feedback from visually impaired staff in order to continuously improve the user experience of the applications.</p>  <p>  While provision of reasonable accommodation for any individual staff member is a matter for each Department my own Department provides devices and office productivity software with industry leading screen reading software that provides text-to-speech outputs for visually impaired and blind staff.</p></reply>

Expenditure on this particular subhead is currently running at just over &euro;11million. This figure does not take into account expenditure incurred by local authorities on flood relief projects where they are the lead implementation and contracting authority but where the OPW is funding the project and where funding drawdown requests in respect of this expenditure has not been submitted by the local authorities.   Capital expenditure on flood relief projects at construction stage would normally increase over the Summer months.</p></reply>

A copy of the report and relevant data can be accessed at the library of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Report shows that there was strong recruitment since 2011 to the estimated 237 recruitment grades across the public service, with over 60,500 new entrants hired. This includes over 16,000 teachers, nearly 5,000 Special Needs Assistants and almost 10,000 nurses. </p>  <p>  The report also quantified the cost of a two point adjustment as approximately &euro;200m and the potential benefit to the individual as &euro;3,301 on average. </p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Report, my Department, in support of the discussions between the parties,  engaged in further work to assess and model the potential budgetary implications and impacts through phasing of the overall quantum.</p>  <p>  Discussions on the issue with public service trade unions and representative associations, commenced in October 2017 and agreement was reached, in September 2018, between the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement on a measure which provides a credible pathway to addressing the concerns of those recruited to our public service since 2011 in a balanced and sustainable way. It provides a fair and affordable path to managing the cost associated with the issue.</p>  <p>  The cost of this measure as agreed during the remaining term of the PSSA is approximately &euro;75m (&euro;27m in 2019 and &euro;48m in 2020). The full cost of the measure based on the end 2017 data in the report is approx. &euro;190m out to 2025. It is estimated some 58% (35,750) of &lsquo;new entrants&rsquo; will benefit from this measure in year 1 rising to 78% (47,750) by year 2. Provision for the additional cost will be provided for in the upcoming budget 2019 and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  In general, the agreement provides for two separate interventions which will take place at point 4 and point 8 of pay scales. The practical effect of this is that for &lsquo;new entrants&rsquo; the relevant points on the scale will be bypassed thereby reducing the time spent (by bypassing two increment points) on the scale for progression to the maximum point.</p>  <p>  This was brought to the Unions and Associations and their members to consider the measure in accordance with the procedures and processes provided for within those bodies and subsequently agreed upon.</p>  <p>  The benefits under the measure became effective from 1 March 2019, and will be applied to each eligible new entrant as they reach the relevant scale points on their current increment date, and will be restricted to Parties adhering to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.</p></reply>

Performance budgeting is a key element of this suite of expenditure reform measures.  </p>  <p>  A key aim of the performance budgeting initiative is to maximise the reporting of relevant quantitative metrics capable of being used to assess trends over time in order to underpin the scrutiny and appraisal of expenditure programmes. The performance budgeting initiative also supports another important aim: transparency and accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to facilitate budget oversight by the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The Performance Report provides timely information on what was delivered with public funds in the previous year. Performance targets are published in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) each December. However, the timing of the publication of the REV means that outturn information for the current year is not yet available and only performance targets can be published. </p>  <p>  The Performance Report is intended to supply that performance data, aiming to enhance the focus on performance and delivery by presenting relevant performance indicators in a dedicated and focused document.</p>  <p>  The 2018 Public Service Performance Report, published in May 2019, was the third of its kind. In addition to the Performance metrics for each Vote group, the Performance Report also includes a chapter updating on the work regarding Equality Budgeting. </p>  <p>  As this is the third edition of the Report, I have decided that this is an opportune point at which to take stock of how the Performance Budgeting initiative is developing and how it might be refined and improved. This process of internal review and reflection is currently underway and will inform how information is presented in next year's report. As part of this exercise, the recommendations of the Parliamentary Budget Office will be taken into consideration and my Department will further engage with stakeholders to identify other areas for development.</p></reply>

This framework for driving development and innovation will build a stronger public service to deliver better quality services for everyone over the period from 2018 to 2020 and beyond. </p>  <p>  As set out in that strategy in order to build agile and resilient public service organisations, public servants need opportunities for career development including increasing expertise and skills in areas such as leadership and management, HRM, ICT, finance, languages, evaluation, data analysis and data management. The Strategic Human Resources Management Leadership Group, supported by the Public Service Reform Programme Management Office (PMO) in my Department and the Public Appointment Service, with input from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on skills needs, lead on this action.</p>  <p>  One of the 3 main pillars of the People Strategy for the Civil Service 2017-2020, which I launched in October 2017, is to &lsquo;build the workforce of the future&rsquo;.  As recognised in that strategy, strategic HR requires a highly co-ordinated and integrated view of the entire workforce over a 5 to 10 year period.  The workforce composition, timing of resourcing and learning and development supports will be aligned with the strategic priorities of all Civil Service Bodies.   In the main this will be achieved via the development of an aggregated Civil Service Workforce Plan (informed by workforce plans of the individual Civil Service Bodies). </p>  <p>  A key enabler of the on-going management of the performance of current and future Civil Service reform is the PMDS system.  PMDS is designed to be a meaningful and useful support to all Staff and Managers in the management and improvement of individual performance. PMDS allows us to strategically align performance management and learning &amp;amp; development to facilitate the matching of skills, expertise and experience to roles.</p>  <p>  As a result of Action 9 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan 2014, to establish a new shared model for delivering learning and development in the Civil Service, OneLearning the Civil Service Learning and Development Centre was established in September 2017. OneLearning, which is based in my Department, will enable Civil Servants regardless of their organisation or location access to training and development opportunities and are responsible for all training that is common across the Civil Service.  To date there have been over 20,000 attendances at a OneLearning course session from 44 Civil Service Bodies across 25 counties. A new Learning Management System, will be rolled out across the Civil Service in 2019. </p>  <p>  OneLearning will continue to work with Civil Service Bodies to identify current and future learning and development requirements and develop appropriate learning solutions to equip civil servants at all levels with the knowledge and skills required to discharge their roles. </p>  <p>  In addition, Civil Service Bodies continue to meet the unique learning and development requirements within their own organisations in relation to individual process obligations and challenges.</p></reply>

In aggregate, a gross voted allocation of &euro;66.6bn is provided across all Government Departments. This includes additional expenditure of approximately &euro;115m specifically related to Brexit and follows the dedicated measures to prepare for Brexit announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018. This funding will enable the implementation of necessary measures including in the areas of customs and food safety controls.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a &euro;300 million Future Growth Loan Scheme is targeted at providing a longer-term facility to support strategic capital investment by business at competitive rates in a post-Brexit environment. With a further view to the impact Brexit will have on the business sector, supports were also provided to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to expand its Departmental and regulatory agency capacity.</p>  <p>  Additional funding was also provided to the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine and its agencies to further strengthen the agriculture sector&rsquo;s ability to become more resilient in addressing the challenges of Brexit.  Also, the OPW has spent in the region of &euro;15.6 million to date on acquiring and developing physical infrastructure for use at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport as a consequence of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit upon the economy and the public finances continues to remain uncertain given that the timing and nature of the UK&rsquo;s exit remains unclear. Indeed, given this uncertainty, it became necessary to take action to prepare for a potential no-deal exit at end March. This included, the recruitment of additional staff by the Revenue Commissioners, with over 400 staff appointed over the period September 2018 to 12 April 2019. </p>  <p>  With uncertainty remaining the Government must continue to plan for the contingency of a disorderly exit. In this context spending plans will be kept under review to identify the potential resources required to deal with the impact of such a scenario this year. This uncertainty will also have implications for Budget 2020. While the SPU maintained an orderly Brexit as the central scenario, a greater likelihood is now being assigned to a no-deal or disorderly Brexit outcome. In this event, it is imperative that the automatic stabilisers are allowed to operate freely. This would include potentially higher social welfare spend as a result of increased unemployment or reduced tax revenue as a result of weaker employment. Further to this, the Government will also provide targeted, temporary, and effective support to the hardest hit sectors of the economy.</p></reply>

It is for this reason that the advice provided by officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the National Broadband Plan was made public on 8 May 2019.</p>  <p>  However, on this occasion, I formed a different view to that of my Department. As I have previously stated, this is for two main reasons. Firstly, there are an array of benefits not captured in the Cost Benefit Analysis, with immense value for citizens and the economy in the future. Secondly, having looked at the other options provided, none would deliver against the objective of achieving 100% coverage while guaranteeing lower cost.</p>  <p>  Rolling out a form of technology like this across the country is an inherently complex activity and therefore one which must involve risk. While I accept that there is complexity and risk involved in the decision taken by Government, I believe that on balance, the National Broadband Plan will provide value for money.</p>  <p>  Regarding the question of the Cost Benefit Analysis, the Public Spending Code requires that Sponsoring Agencies prepare an economic appraisal such as a cost benefit analysis or a cost effectiveness analysis for projects with an estimated cost in excess of &euro;20 million before the relevant Sanctioning Authority makes a decision on whether to approve the project. The Public Spending Code further requires that this project appraisal is continually updated as the procurement process evolves and as actual tender costs (as opposed to cost estimates) become available.  Responsibility for complying with all of the requirements of the Public Spending Code is a matter for each Sponsoring Agency and Sanctioning Authority.</p>  <p>  In the case of the National Broadband Plan, the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment has conducted a cost benefit analysis and updated it on a number of occasions.  Taking account of that analysis and  the cascade of further future benefits that I believe will flow from the project, I am convinced that the project is justified.</p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices including the Department of Health to ensure that expenditure is being managed in line with not only Departmental allocations but also within the overall fiscal parameters. Each month, the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on against published expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-May 2019 was just over &euro;26 billion. This is &euro;145 million, or 0.6% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;24.2 billion, is &euro;65 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 12 are below profile on current expenditure for end-May. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;1.8 billion, is &euro;98 million, or 4.1% below profile.  </p>  <p>  In year-on-year terms total gross expenditure is 8.2% or nearly &euro;2 billion higher than the same period in 2018. Of this increase, gross current expenditure is up just over &euro;1.5 billion. A key driver of this year-on-year increase in current expenditure is day to day Health spending. Gross current expenditure of &euro;6.9 billion by Health is &euro;559 million or 8.9% higher than the same period in 2018.  This is compared to the overall increase of 5.8% budgeted for the full year and illustrates the challenge and the need for staffing and savings measures to be proactively managed by the Department of Health if the requirement for a Supplementary Estimate in the sector is to be avoided this year.</p></reply>

In addition, Brexit is of course a significant risk and source of major uncertainty. While this is challenging, it is important to note that we are in a strong position from which to meet that challenge. Provisional figures indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s GDP grew by 6.7 per cent in 2018. This is a healthy pace of growth, which is being reflected in our labour market. Indeed, according to latest CSO figures, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for May 2019 was 4.4%, down from 5.9% compared to same point in 2018. However, given the risks I have noted, now is the time for sustainable expenditure policy that is affordable now and into the future. </p>  <p>  A key challenge is to ensure that Departments manage expenditure each year within the allocations voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. In this regard, measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis. Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Government Minister and Department. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-May 2019 was &euro;26,066 million. This is &euro;145 million, or 0.6% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;24,184 million, is &euro;65 million, or 0.3% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 12 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-May. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;1,833 million, is &euro;81 million, or 4.1% below profile and up &euro;454 million, or 31.8% on the same period last year. While this is encouraging, there is a particular challenge in the Health sector, where the year-on-year increase to the end of May illustrates the challenge and the need for staffing and savings measures to be proactively managed by the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2019. In setting out the Government&rsquo;s overall fiscal strategy in the SES, I will take into account recent developments, in particular in the external environment, and will consider the points raised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in its recent fiscal assessment report.</p></reply>

An important goal of the current framework for Public Service reform - Our Public Service 2020 - which became operational during 2018, is to encourage innovation across the public service and to promote different service delivery options. This notably includes supporting the use of Business Process Automation, as referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, to help public service organisations to deliver leaner, faster and cheaper back-office functions. </p>  <p>  Automation of the rules-based and repetitive processes that are a necessary and unavoidable feature of the work of most public service bodies has the potential also to add significant value to our workforce by freeing up individuals to concentrate on more value-add as well as interesting and engaging work.</p>  <p>  In this context, my Department funded a pilot project in 2016 to examine the potential of Business Process Automation in the delivery of public services. Government Departments and Offices were invited to propose suitable processes that would be amenable to such automation. The Revenue Commissioners, the Public Appointments Service, the Property Registration Authority and the National Shared Services Office participated in this pilot under which a total of 14 processes were automated at a total cost of approximately &euro;110,000. </p>  <p>  The results of this pilot suggest that the solution can work very well in the right circumstances. However, it takes time to embed the technology, to generate support from the IT function, to train staff and, crucially, to find the right processes to automate.</p>  <p>  On foot of this, my Department worked with the Office of Government Procurement during 2018 to publish a procurement framework for Business Process Automation. This framework will allow public service bodies to rapidly deploy automation within their organisations and train their own staff to automate suitable processes.

The pre-Estimates Departmental expenditure position is provided in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report (MYER).  This sets the baseline for examination of budgetary priorities by the Government and the Oireachtas. Following detailed consideration, Ministerial Expenditure Ceilings are published in the Budget day Expenditure Report.</p>  <p>  Expenditure Report 2019 sets out the revised baseline for current expenditure out to 2021 after taking account of pre-commitments in relation to demographic pressures in Health, Social Protection and Education, public service pay agreements, and the estimated carryover impact of certain budget measures. Planned capital investment levels out to 2027 have been set out under the National Development Plan. The allocation of these resources at a departmental ceiling level are set out in the Revised Estimates Volume 2019, out to 2022.</p>  <p>  The Ceilings also include an amount of unallocated resources in 2020 and 2021, based on the fiscal projections at Budget time last year.  These can be utilised to meet the carryover impact of Budget 2019 measures or for new expenditure measures. Indeed, the flexibility provided within the ceilings allow Government to direct available additional resources towards key services at a time of increased demand and to new priorities. In addition, at Budget time each year Government can decide to allocate additional resources for spending increases by either introducing revenue raising measures and/or redistributing resources allocated for taxation measures.</p>  <p>  While this approach has been the subject of comment, it has been informed by the experience in the years leading to the fiscal crisis and is targeted at ensuring that the overall increase in expenditure each year is set at a level that is affordable both now and in the future. This necessitates an approach to expenditure management in which a systematic programme of expenditure reviews and efficiency-generating reforms is underway in each sector to ensure that priority initiatives can be supported and developed in a sustainable manner. The Summer Economic Statement, which will be published in the near future, will set out the Government's updated medium-term economic and fiscal strategy, and in this context I will be giving careful consideration to the inputs and advices of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.</p></reply>

Consequently, the approach currently adopted has been informed by the experience in the period leading up to the fiscal and economic crisis. </p>  <p>  In the years preceding the crisis, large increases in expenditure were implemented on an annual basis, which ultimately proved to be unsustainable. Reflecting on this, there are clear risks to the expenditure position associated with restating expenditure ceilings and for example applying inflationary increases as a revised baseline for any new expenditure. This can lead to the expenditure &lsquo;ceiling&rsquo; becoming a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; from which further expenditure increases are negotiated, which in turn can lead to unsustainable trends that are not affordable on a long-term basis. </p>  <p>  To mitigate against this, the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2016 set out an expenditure strategy for 2016 to 2021 in which current expenditure would grow by an annual average of 2 &frac12; per cent, while capital expenditure would grow at 12 &frac12; per cent on average. There have been variations from these expenditure growth rates, largely driven by policy decisions, such as additional funding for our Health Service and increased investment in public capital infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Work is underway on the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2019. In setting out the Government&rsquo;s overall fiscal strategy in the SES, I will take into account recent developments, in particular in the external environment, and will consider the points raised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in its recent fiscal assessment report.</p></reply>

The intention of this review is to set out a road map for the Civil Defence organisation over the next 10-15 years. The outcome of this review will be a policy document, titled "Towards 2030", which I intend to publish in the coming months.</p>  <p>  As part of the review, there has been a wide ranging consultation process with all stakeholders, including Local Authority management, Civil Defence Officers and Assistant Civil Defence Officers, volunteers, and the Principal Response Agencies. </p>  <p>  To inform the consultation process, a draft document has been prepared setting out proposals for consideration in relation to future roles. </p>  <p>  In terms of the auxiliary fire service, this has been an integral part of Civil Defence since its establishment in 1951.  However Civil Defence have had limited involvement in fire fighting in recent years with their role focused on wild land fires in a small number of counties.

Other sectors delivered these savings through a variety of approaches including additional working time and reduced rates of overtime payments.</p>  <p>  The contribution from the Defence sector included a further reduction of 10% on the rate of certain allowances payable to the Defence Forces. As part of the cost saving measures to be secured under the agreement, it was also agreed with the Representative Associations that the Saturday and Sunday rates for Security Duty Allowance would be flat rated.</p>  <p>  The cost of restoring the premium rates and the 10% cut to SDA introduced in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016, would be in the region of  &euro;2 million per annum. This figure is based on the 2018 payments of SDA. As security duties are demand led and the number of duties can fluctuate year on year, this variable must be taken into consideration in comparing any actual figures with speculative amounts. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, PDFORRA and RACO have made claims for the restoration of the premium rates which is being processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) Scheme. As discussions under the C&amp;A scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time.</p></reply>

My Department continually analyses and prepares briefing on short and medium-term macroeconomic trends in European and international economy. This includes informing me of the latest forecasts from the international institutions for the global economy, and for our key trading partners.</p><p>At European level, through both the ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings, Ministers work alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to take stock of the latest economic situation, including the risks and opportunities for European economies in the short to medium-term. </p><p>As published in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2019, my Department has forecast economic growth to moderate to a more sustainable rate of 3.9 per cent in 2019, and to continue at the broadly similar pace of 3.3 per cent for 2020. Although growth rates have moderated from 2018, they still compare very favourably to other EU, and significant non-EU, trading partners.</p><p>Growth in the Irish economy is expected to come from both modified domestic demand, which is set to increase by 4.0 per cent in 2019, and an expansion in Irish exports &ndash; which are set to grow by 5.2 per cent this year. Modified domestic demand excludes the volatile components of investment spending &ndash; giving a more accurate picture of the health of domestic economic activity. </p><p>The SPU sets out the principal economic risks facing the Irish economy (e.g. domestic overheating and capacity constraints, trade disruptions, Brexit), along with an assessment of their relative likelihood and economic impact. The balance of risk is firmly tilted to the downside, both in the short-term and over the medium-term. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s economic data compare favourably to those of our main trading partners &ndash; with growth, unemployment, and inflation performing better than the Euro Area and EU averages - as the data in Table 1 below illustrate. </p><p>The European economy is projected to grow for the seventh year in a row in 2019, albeit moderately, with expansion forecast in all Member States. The pace of growth is expected to ease compared to the high rates of recent years &ndash; to 1.4 per cent this year and picking up slightly to 1.6 per cent in 2020. For the Euro Area, the Commission is forecasting growth of 1.2 per cent this year, strengthening slightly to 1.5 per cent in 2020. </p><p>Annual UK GDP growth slowed from 1.8 per cent in 2017 to 1.4 per cent in 2018 due to a range of factors including falling business investment and slowing external demand. In the light of Brexit, projections for 2019 and 2020 of 1.3 per cent are based on a purely technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading patterns between the EU27 and the UK. Growth in the US economy will slow but remain relatively strong at 2.4 per cent for 2019, easing further to 1.9 per cent in 2020. </p><p>In common with Ireland, unemployment continues to fall in the EU and US, with the US labour market set to tighten further as it approaches full employment. In the UK, unemployment will remain stable as employment growth slows in the context of subdued GDP figures.</p><p>The Government has taken significant action to ensure Ireland is aware of, and ready for developments in major partner countries. We have worked hard to rebalance our economy from where it was in the previous decade, before the global financial crisis. Growth in our economy today is evenly spread across a range of sectors, equipping us to better withstand the challenges ahead. The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities while working in accordance with our EU partners.  </p><p>Table 1<table><tr><th></th><th>Real GDP </th><th></th><th></th><th>Inflation </th><th></th><th></th><th>Unemployment </th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td></td><td>2018 </td><td>2019 </td><td>2020 </td><td>2018</td><td>2019</td><td>2020</td><td>2018 </td><td>2019 </td><td>2020 </td></tr><tr><td>Ireland (SPU 2019 forecasts) </td><td>6.7 </td><td>3.9 </td><td>3.3 </td><td>0.7 </td><td>0.9 </td><td>1.1 </td><td>5.7 </td><td>5.4 </td><td>5.2 </td></tr><tr><td>UK </td><td>1.4 </td><td>1.3 </td><td>1.3 </td><td>2.5 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>2.1 </td><td>4.0 </td><td>4.1 </td><td>4.2 </td></tr><tr><td>Euro Area </td><td>1.9 </td><td>1.2 </td><td>1.5 </td><td>1.8 </td><td>1.4 </td><td>1.4 </td><td>8.2 </td><td>7.7 </td><td>7.3 </td></tr><tr><td>EU28 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>1.4 </td><td>1.6 </td><td>1.9 </td><td>1.6 </td><td>1.7 </td><td>6.8 </td><td>6.5 </td><td>6.2 </td></tr><tr><td>US </td><td>2.9 </td><td>2.4 </td><td>1.9 </td><td>2.4 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>3.9 </td><td>3.8 </td><td>3.7 </td></tr></table></p><p><i>Source: European Commission Spring 2019 forecasts and Department of Finance SPU 2019 forecasts for Ireland </i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-20a.157.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062000053#WRD06900"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that the legal framework governing insurance regulation is determined at EU level through the Solvency II Directive. This is transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulation 2015 (SI No. 485 of 2015). Solvency II provides the basis for how insurers can operate in the EU and amongst other things prohibits interference by me or the Central Bank of Ireland in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  It also precludes models such as the fuel tax one proposed in the attached correspondence. The second proposal to establish a national insurance scheme for under 25s would also be problematic as any such arrangement would have to comply with the standard prudential rules that apply to private insurers. Because of the concentration of such a high risk category in one company, such insurance would likely be very expensive. In relation to the third option, of a cross-subsidisation of younger drivers, it is difficult to see that there would be much support from already hard pressed motorists for this proposal as it could add significantly to their existing premiums. </p><p>In pricing insurance, I understand that motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how the vehicle is used, the claims record, and the number of drivers.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices vary across the market.  In addition, insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience.  I acknowledge the point that it would be helpful if insurers provided appropriately anonymised actuarial data to support their case with regard to pricing policy for younger motorists, however insurers argue that such information is commercially sensitive and unfortunately I am not in a position to compel them to disclose such information.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the Cost of Insurance Working Group was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.The initial focus of the Working Group was on motor insurance premiums The <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>was published in January 201 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  In January 2018, the Working Group published the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  </i>This Report makes a further 15 Recommendations with 29 associated actions.  </p><p>There has been significant work to date in implementing the recommendations of the two aforementioned reports, including the following:</p><p>- the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent  recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;</p><p>- the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; </p><p>- reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019</i>;</p><p>- amendments  to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud  or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,</p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na,  including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as  the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focuson insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee</i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.  </p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  It is acknowledged however that this is an average figure and young drivers may not be benefitting to the same degree.</p><p>Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a further sustainable reduction in insurance costs for motorists is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.</p><p>It should be noted that work is progressing as a matter of priority on the Judicial Council Bill, and it is due to complete Report and Final Stages in the Seanad this week, prior to being submitted to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shortly thereafter.  I would hope that members of both Houses of the Oireachtas can collectively work together to ensure that the Judicial Council Bill is enacted by the summer.</p><p>Finally, I would advise younger drivers who are quoted increased premiums to consult the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website (), which has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance generally.  One of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.  Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

Whether a relief or scheme is to be extended will be considered as part of the deliberative process in relation to Budget 2020.  The four reliefs are a capital allowance scheme, known as the Living City Initiative, a farm restructuring scheme allowing relief from capital gains tax, a Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) refund scheme for hybrid electrical vehicles and the Help to Buy scheme for first time owners of residential property.  </p><p>The Living City Initiative, a scheme of property tax incentives that was enacted in Finance Act 2013 and commenced on 5<sup>th</sup>May 2015, is due to terminate on 4<sup>th</sup>May 2020. The scheme provides tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment and conversion of both residential and commercial buildings and is aimed at the regeneration of certain areas in the historic centres of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford. There are three types of relief available; owner occupier residential relief, rented residential (landlord) relief and commercial or retail relief. The rented residential relief was introduced with effect from 1 January 2017. Owner occupier relief is given by writing off expenditure incurred at a rate of 10% per annum over ten years. Rented residential and commercial/retail relief is given by way of capital allowances (expenditure incurred is written off over a 7 year period at a rate of 15% per annum over 6 years and 10% in the final year). </p><p>The most recent statistics available for this scheme are as follows:</p><p><table><tr><th>2016Amount claimed &euro;M</th><th>2016Minimum tax cost assumed @ 40% for IT and 12.5% for CT &euro;M</th><th>2016Number of claimants </th></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>0.2</td><td>15</td></tr></table></p><p>Section 604B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides relief from capital gains tax for farm restructuring by individuals where the sale, purchase or exchange of agricultural land takes place on or before 31 December 2019. To qualify for relief under that section, Teagasc must certify that the sale and purchase or the exchange of the land is carried out for farm restructuring purposes. </p><p>Information in relation to this relief was only first included in the tax returns for 2018 and therefore there is no current information available from Revenue sources as to the cost of this relief. </p><p>Finance Act 1992 provides for a remission or repayment of Vehicle Registration Tax on both series production hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles up to a maximum of &euro;1,500 in the case of hybrid electrical vehicles and &euro;2,500 in the case of plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles. These reliefs are due to expire on 31 December 2019.</p><p>I am informed by Revenue that the annual cost of providing a remission or a repayment of Vehicle  Registration Tax for plugin hybrids and hybrid electric vehicles for 2018 and to 31 May 2019 is provided in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>&euro; Costs Millions</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;22.5</td></tr><tr><td>2019 (End of May 2019)*</td><td>&euro;17.7</td></tr></table></p><p>The Help to Buy (HTB) Scheme was introduced with effect from 1 January 2017 and is due to end in December 2019. It was introduced to assist first-time purchasers with the deposit required to buy or build a new house or apartment. The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid over the previous four years, subject to certain limits applying, as set out in the legislation.</p><p>It is open to HTB claimants to select any or all of the previous 4 tax years for the purposes of calculating the HTB refund.  The maximum refund is calculated at the lowest of:-</p><p>(1)  &euro;20,000, </p><p>(2)  income tax and DIRT paid in the previous 4 years, or </p><p>(3) 5% of the purchase price, or valuation in the case of a self-build, up to a maximum of &euro;500,000 (a &euro;600,000 maximum applied where, in the period from 19 July 2016 to 31 December 2016, a contract for the purchase of a new house was entered into, or in the case of a self-build, the first tranche of a qualifying loan was drawn down by the claimant).</p><p>The HTB scheme provides for the registration of building contractors with Revenue for participation in the scheme and for clawback of tax relief given in certain circumstances. The scheme applies where, in the period from 19 July 2016 to 31 December 2019, an individual enters into a contract with a qualifying contractor for the purchase of a qualifying residence or has drawn down the first tranche of a qualifying loan in respect of the individual&rsquo;s self-build qualifying residence.</p><p>Revenue has provided me with the following information in relation to the annual cost of this scheme.</p><p><table><tr><th>2018Number of claims</th><th>2018Tax cost &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>4,957</td><td>73.1</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This includes a table showing the estimated cost of a 1% indexation of credits, rate bands and exemption limits for Income Tax and the Universal Social Charge. As per this document the total full year cost of a 1% increase in all the tax credits and thresholds shown is estimated at &euro;187 million.  </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the full year cost of a 1% increase in the threshold at which workers enter the 40% income tax rate is &euro;79 million. </p><p>Revenue have advised that these figures are based on projected 2019 incomes as calculated on the basis of actual data for the year 2016, the latest year for which returns are available, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. The figures are provisional and may be revised. Revenue does not provide cost estimates beyond the tax year 2019.</p><p>Increases greater than 1% can be estimated on a straight-line or pro-rata basis from the information given.</p><p>The 2019 Stability Programme Update was finalised and published in April this year.  It sets outs the Government&rsquo;s updated macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for the period 2019-2023, including price developments that impact price and wage inflation.  As this document sets out, there are a number of different metrics that could be used for indexation, such as &ldquo;core&rdquo; inflation which is forecast to be 1.1% for 2019.</p><p>Utilising a purely technical calculation, by using this figure and the most recent <i>Revenue Ready Reckoner</i>, the estimated full year cost of indexing in the tax credits would be &euro;205.7 million and the cost of indexing the standard rate cut off point would be &euro;87 million.</p></reply>

Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability, and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  Since 2004 the amount of the Industry funding levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of total assets. </p>  <p>  Consultation Paper 95 &lsquo;Joint Public Consultation Paper - Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland - Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95) was published in 2015 and set out proposals to move from partial industry funding of financial regulation towards full industry funding, noting the proposal set out in an earlier consultation conducted by the Central Bank (CP61 &lsquo;Consultation on Impact Based Levies and Other Levy Related Matters&rsquo;) to move credit unions to fund 50% of the cost of regulating the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank indicated, in its Funding Strategy and 2018 Guide to the Industry Funding Levy, that it intended to seek my approval to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs to be recovered from credit unions on a phased basis setting out an initial target of 50% to be reached by 2021.</p>  <p>  In response to the Central Bank's request I recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until: </p>  <p>  a.  The levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and</p>  <p>  b.

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to motorists.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and as part of that exercise, there was and has been extensive interaction with the insurance industry and its representative bodies.  The <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>was published in January 201 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  In January 2018, the Working Group published the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  </i>This Report makes a further 15 Recommendations with 29 associated actions.  While this Report is focussed on addressing issues linked to business insurance, the implementation of recommendations from both reports will have a positive impact for all consumers and businesses including motorists.  </p><p>There has been significant work to date in implementing the recommendations of the two aforementioned reports, including the following:</p><p>- the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;</p><p>- the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; </p><p>- reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019</i>;</p><p>- amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,</p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee</i>, which targets insurance-related criminality. </p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  </p><p>Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a further sustainable reduction in insurance costs for motorists is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  </p><p>It should be noted that work is progressing as a matter of priority on the Judicial Council Bill, and it is due to complete Report and Final Stages in the Seanad this week, prior to being submitted to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shortly thereafter.  I would hope that members of both Houses of the Oireachtas can collectively work together to ensure that the Judicial Council Bill is enacted by the summer.</p></reply>

More recently, there has been significant investment in the residential sector. Much of this investment has been in the form of non-bank lending and equity financing.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the increase in foreign investment in the construction sector, the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s (CBI) recent Systemic Risk Pack, published in March this year, stated that &ldquo;Property-related lending accounts for 68 per cent of Irish banks loan book, highlighting a concentration risk amongst Irish resident banks. This compares to a long run average of 62 per cent and a European average of approximately 60 per cent measured at 2018 Q2&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The domestic banks&rsquo; need to reduce their exposure to the property sector in the aftermath of the economic crisis meant that the absence of international investment would have resulted in somewhat lower levels of activity in the commercial and residential sectors. Access to foreign capital, whether through direct investment, equity, or lending played an important part in the recovery of the construction sector. Given the relatively high level of property-related exposure that remains on the domestic bank&rsquo;s balance sheets, foreign capital will continue to play an important role in the Irish construction sector.</p>  <p>  The presence of foreign investors can expose the domestic market to international financing conditions and overseas asset market corrections. The propensity for international investors to diversify across different markets, including Ireland, may see these markets becoming more synchronised with global real estate cycles. With more globally synchronised markets, the potential for spillovers is higher and the scope for loss mitigation through diversification is diminished. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s assessments of the principal economic and fiscal risks are set out twice yearly in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) in April and in the Budget Economic and Fiscal Outlook in October. The Stability Programme Update 2019, identifies a number of external risks  of which two - &lsquo;External demand shock&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bond market conditions&rsquo; - implicitly encompass risks of this nature. The Summer Economic Statement forms a key element of the reformed budgetary process by providing a policy background for the discussions in the D&aacute;il and, at the National Economic Dialogue which takes place later this month. It complements the SPU.</p></reply>

In the years preceding the crisis, large increases in expenditure were implemented on an annual basis, which ultimately proved to be unsustainable. Reflecting on this, there are clear risks to the expenditure position associated with restating expenditure ceilings, and for example applying inflationary increases, as a revised baseline for any new expenditure. This can lead to the expenditure &lsquo;ceiling&rsquo; becoming a &lsquo;floor&rsquo; from which to negotiate, which in turn can lead to unsustainable increases that are not affordable on a long-term basis. </p>  <p>  To mitigate against this, the Summer Economic Statement 2016 set out an expenditure strategy for 2016 to 2021 in which current expenditure would grow by an annual average of 2 &frac12; per cent. This approach has been adopted in each annual Summer Economic Statement produced since. While there have been variations from the expenditure targets set out in the publications, these have been largely driven by policy decisions to support key Government programmes. For example, additional funding has been provided for our Health Service and increased investment in public capital infrastructure reflecting the allocation of additional resources set out in the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  Work is underway on the Summer Economic Statement (SES) 2019.

Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Government Minister and Department. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. </p>  <p>  There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  Public service pay expenditure is a function of two key drivers: </p>  <p>  1. the numbers of public servants employed, and </p>  <p>  2. the rate at which they are paid.  </p>  <p>  As of 2019 there are over 330,000 full time equivalent public servants with an exchequer pay bill of &euro;18.7 billion, or approximately 1/3 of current expenditure.  In this context, the objective of public service pay policy is to manage pay expenditure at a sustainable level, which allows for the recruitment and retention of appropriately skilled staff. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, pay and conditions of public servants are managed through collective agreements, of which the current agreement is The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 -2020. This Agreement, the terms of which have been implemented through the provisions of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act, 2017,  provides for the dismantling of the financial emergency legislation through fair and sustainable increases in public service pay.</p></reply>

I can therefore assure the Deputy that this reform agenda will continue to be an integral part of the policies administered by the Department.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a new phase of public service reform is already underway, as set out in the framework document <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>, which I launched at end 2017. <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>seeks better outcomes for the public, to support innovation and collaboration and to build public service organisations that are resilient and agile. It contains an added focus in particular on evaluation and on the importance of building a reform evaluation culture. A newly established Reform Evaluation Unit within my Department will work closely with units focused on performance budgeting and spending reviews to strengthen the links between expenditure and reform. A Public Service Leadership Board comprising Secretary General and CEO level participants from across the civil and public service has been established to drive this reform agenda and lead on its implementation and it has already met on six occasions since it was established in March of last year.</p><p>In the case of the Civil Service, the Deputy may also be aware of the ambitious programme of reform under the Civil Service Renewal Plan aimed at creating a more unified, professional, responsive, open and accountable Civil Service providing a world-class service to the State and to the people of Ireland. The fourth Progress Report on the Plan, which I published recently, shows the important steps that have been taken since 2014 and the range of reforms that have been put in place to improve the service for those who work in the Civil Service and those who depend on it. Work is now underway on developing a refreshed plan for the next phase of Civil Service Renewal which will align with <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s People Strategy for the Civil Service 2017-2020 sets the strategic direction for Human Resource Management across the Civil Service (while recognising that each organisation is unique and has its own challenges) while the Department&rsquo;s Office of the Government Chief Information Officer leads the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy in cooperation with departments and agencies across the Public Service. </p><p>At the same time, the Department is progressing a far-reaching programme of reforms aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government. Key initiatives completed or underway under this programme include the second Review of the 2015 Lobbying Act, progression of the Public Sector Standards Bill and transposition of the EU&rsquo;s Open Data and Whistleblowing Directives.</p><p>As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I must ensure that our fiscal and public expenditure policy is prudent and sustainable. There are a number of budgetary reforms introduced in recent years to guide my decisions on overall fiscal policy in this regard, including fiscal rules, expenditure ceilings and spending reviews. The actions in <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>will ensure that the focus of the public service is very much on delivery of quality public services, while operating within these prudent limits.</p><p>I am confident that the implementation of the actions contained in <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>, as well as the other elements of my Department&rsquo;s broader reform agenda that I have outlined, will have an ongoing positive impact on economic performance and improved service delivery to the public in the future.</p></reply>

Indeed modified domestic demand, an underlying measure of growth in the economy, grew by 4.5 per cent for 2018 as a whole.</p>  <p>  One of the best barometers of the heath in the economy is the labour market.  The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year, with total employment increasing by 81,200 (+3.7 per cent) in the year to Q1 2019. As a result, there are now more people working in Ireland than ever before. </p>  <p>  At the cornerstone of our recovery, has been the improvement in our competitiveness. Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 22 per cent. The improvement in our competitiveness reflects the hard-won productivity gains made over the last number of years, alongside wage and price moderation. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In the first four months of 2019, average annual inflation of just 1.1 per cent was recorded. </p>  <p>  On wage developments, while average annual earnings grew by over 3 per cent in 2018, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. The rise in household incomes is a welcome development, however it needs to be monitored closely to avoid a significant acceleration in wages, which may undermine Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness to other European countries.</p>  <p>  Over the medium term, the domestic economy is expected to act as the primary driver of growth. In this context, we must remain cognisant of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, that could give rise to a loss of competitiveness. </p>  <p>  Indeed, as we approach full employment, the economy is in an unusual position, with possible domestic overheating and capacity constraints on one hand and a slowdown in key export markets on the other. Brexit also represents a significant risk and is part of a wider environment of global uncertainty. In order to mitigate against these risks, it is important that the economy is in a strong position to retain competitiveness and resistant to external shocks. Taking this into account, the National Development Plan (NDP) includes a more than doubling of capital investment from &euro;4.2 to &euro;8.6 billion between 2016 and 2021. This increase reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing bottlenecks which could hinder the economy going forward. </p>  <p>  These risks mentioned above highlight the need for a cautious approach to expenditure policy, which is sustainable now and into the future. In contrast to the increases in expenditure seen in the years leading up to the crisis, recent expenditure increases have been based on sustainable growth underpinned by predictable revenue sources. It is crucial that this approach is maintained in the medium term in order to mitigate against emerging risks in the domestic and global economy. As such, the expenditure ceilings set out in the forthcoming SES will be based on the expenditure strategy set out in the SPU, published by the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  Ireland still has a significant level of public debt following the global financial crisis. While debt-to-GDP ratio has been declining over recent years, this is primarily due to the increase in GDP, rather than a reduction in the debt itself, which remains at over &euro;200 million. At the end of 2018, our debt ratio as a percentage of GDP was 64.8 per cent. Maintaining sustainable expenditure policy is an important element of ensuring that our economy is performing well and that our debt-to-GDP and debt-to-GNI* ratios continue to decline. This includes ensuring that we are delivering public services in the most efficient and effective way possible. To this end, a number of reforms have been put in place in recent years, including the Performance Budgeting Initiative, the Equality Budgeting Initiative, the National Economic Dialogue and the Spending Review.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, published at the end of last year and updated at the end of January, sets out the comprehensive, cross-Government preparations for Brexit.  All Departments have sector-specific plans in place identifying key challenges associated with Brexit and associated mitigation approaches.  </p>  <p>  Central to the Government&rsquo;s preparation for Brexit is the prudent management of the public finances so as to ensure the economy remains competitive in the face of future economic headwinds.  Dedicated measures to prepare for Brexit have been announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, to ensure that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring.</p>  <p>  Most recently, Budget 2019 ensures that the economy is prepared for the challenges of Brexit through continued prudent management of the public finances: by balancing the books; reducing the debt burden; improving the competitiveness of our personal taxation system; and continuing to invest in infrastructure.</p>  <p>  The impact of Brexit upon the economy and the public finances continues to remain uncertain given that the timing and nature of the UK&rsquo;s exit remains unclear. With uncertainty remaining, the Government must continue to plan for the contingency of a disorderly exit. In this context spending plans will be kept under review to identify the potential resources required to deal with the impact of such a scenario this year. This uncertainty will also have implications for Budget 2020.</p></reply>

Important measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure targets are being achieved. Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters and there is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels. Expenditure profiles are published for each month and the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Exchequer Statement.</p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-May 2019 was &euro;26,066 million. This is &euro;145 million, or 0.6% below profile and &euro;1,967 million, or 8.2 % up in year-on-year terms. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;24,184 million, is &euro;65 million, or 0.3% below profile and &euro;1,513 million, or 6.7% up in year-on-year terms. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 12 are on or below profile on current expenditure for end-May. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;1,833 million, is &euro;81 million, or 4.1% below profile and up &euro;454 million, or 31.8% on the same period last year.</p>  <p>  A key driver of the year-on-year increase in current expenditure to end-May is day-to-day spending on Health. While gross current expenditure of &euro;6.9 billion by Health is below profile for May, in year-on-year terms it is an increase of &euro;559 million or 8.9% compared to the same period in 2018.  Given that the budgeted increase for the full year is 5.8%, this demonstrates the need for careful management in the remainder of the year and the requirement for staffing and savings measures to be proactively managed by the Department of Health.</p></reply>

Policy in respect of air travel is contained in the Foreign Travel Guidelines 2009.  It is a matter for each accounting officer or accountable person in the case of non-vote expenditure to ensure the rules in respect of travel and subsistence are followed so as to ensure value for money. </p>  <p>  With regard to State bodies, as set out in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, 2016 the  Board has a key role in setting the ethical tone of a State body, not only by its own actions but also in overseeing senior management and staff.  The board should ensure a culture of claiming expenses only as appropriate to business needs and in accordance with good practice in the public sector generally and introduce controls to prevent fraud including adequate controls to ensure compliance with prescribed procedures in relation to claiming of expenses for business travel.  </p>  <p>  The accounting officer or accountable person has a key role in the system of accountability for public moneys.  It is, of course, a matter for each individual Department and public body concerned to ensure that there are appropriate oversight arrangements and governance structures in place to ensure that where any misspending takes place, there are internal controls and internal audit systems in place to ensure, in as far as possible, that these are detected and are addressed. </p>  <p>  The core duties of the C&amp;AG, in conducting a financial audit are to ensure the financial statements properly present the transactions and balances, and that transactions have been &ldquo;regular&rdquo;.

In addition, his audits have regard to the standards of propriety set out in the relevant codes of practice.  He reports publicly where he identifies material matters relating to the manner in which public business has been conducted, including material instances of excess spending, or spending without a clear business purpose. </p>  <p>  The C&amp;AG&rsquo;s remit covers central Government Departments and Offices and non-commercial State bodies.

Schools who provide 4 periods a week for each of the three years will meet the minimum requirement of the specification. </p>  <p>  The earlier Junior Certificate mathematics syllabus (2016) which the new specification replaced was also designed as a 240 hour course of study. </p>  <p>  The decision as to whether to provide mathematics over 5 days or 4 days is a school decision but my Department's position is that the course can be completed in a 4 period per week timeframe.</p>  <p>  The Junior Cycle programme is designed to be delivered over a full three years with a considerable degree of flexibility available to schools in how and when the full range of specification material is covered.  Where loss of class time occurs for any exceptional reason, schools and teachers will seek to ensure that their students are supported in covering all of the necessary course material in to order prepare adequately for examinations.

The performance of this role is subject to appropriate governance, oversight and accountability requirements. In this context, section 38 of the Universities Act, 1997 contains specific provision for a university to borrow within a framework agreed with the Higher Education Authority (HEA). This framework, which was agreed with my Department and the now Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has been in operation for some time.</p>  <p>  The function of the framework is:</p>  <p>  - That a university can engage in borrowing, underwriting and guaranteeing activities provided that they impose no threat to, and do not create any contingent liabilities for the public purse.</p>  <p>  - To ensure that the capacity of a university to function effectively is not endangered.</p>  <p>  - That advanced approval by the HEA, or the Ministers for Education and Skills and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, of individual instances of borrowing, underwriting or guaranteeing by a university is not required.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, a university is not required to notify my Department of borrowings or obtain prior consent from my Department, or the HEA, to engage in borrowing, underwriting or guaranteeing activities. In addition there is no recourse, implied or otherwise, to the Exchequer for any liabilities matured or maturing by these institutions.</p>  <p>  The aggregate amount of monies borrowed by the universities in the 2016/17 accounting year was &euro;637 million.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Education and Training Boards (ETBs), section 49 of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 states that ETBs may, with the consent of the Minister, accept a proposal, and borrow by means specified in the proposal, for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the board. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that there are currently no moneys borrowed by any of the 16 ETBs. Some ETBs have sanction in place for an overdraft facility. The ETBs with that sanction have confirmed to officials in my Department last month that no overdraft facility is currently being utilised.</p></reply>

This amounts to an increase approaching 25% over the period. In addition, the Government has already committed to a five year programme of increased investment amounting to &euro;300m, commencing next year, under the Human Capital Initiative. It represents a significant response to projected demographic pressures impacting on the sector over the next five years, as highlighted in the report on future funding.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-20a.278.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062000055#WRF04900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 111 and 128 to 130, inclusive, together.</p><p>Further to the relevant Written Replies made by myself and the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe TD, on 13 July 2019, I have sought additional information on those regulatory breaches involving insurance 'claims harvesters' as sought under today's Questions by Deputy McGrath. In response the Law Society has provided statistics to my Department in respect of the years 2014 to 2018 and to date for 2019 as set out in the table below.</p><p>In 2014 responsibility for the regulation of solicitors' advertising transferred from the Complaints and Client Relations Committee of the Law Society to its Regulation of Practice Committee. At that time, the Society also employed a dedicated advertising regulations executive to pro-actively enforce the regulation of this area.  Accordingly, the Law Society has been able to provide statistics relating to its enforcement, of primary legislation and the Solicitors (Advertising) Regulations 2002, from 2014. As can be seen from the figures provided, in all, some 28 websites owned by solicitors or other operators have now been removed or have become inoperable. This, I understand, includes some removed since the end of last year and two websites that are dormant following liquidation of the company concerned. It should also be noted, as set out in the table, that a further 15 solicitor-owned websites have been brought into regulatory compliance by the Law Society in this regard.</p><p><table><tr><th>Websites</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019 (to date)</th><th>Current Total</th></tr><tr><td>Solicitor owned and removed</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Non-solicitor owned and removed</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Solicitor owned and brought into compliance</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>15</td></tr></table></p><p>As I have set out in my Written Reply to Question No. 114 of 13 June 2019, the current regulatory approach to advertising by solicitors will be replaced under section 218 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. Under that section, such advertising will no longer be regulated by the legal professional bodies as happens at present but by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. This new regime, which will apply to both solicitors and barristers, will come into effect early next year including in terms of the provision of any relevant statistical data. The Authority will be carrying out its required public consultations later this year in preparation for the introduction of the new legal services advertising regulations in Q1 of 2020 supported, of course, by my commencement of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act. </p><p>It is important to note that both the Law Society and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority are responsible, under the respective legislative provisions concerned, solely for the regulation of legal practitioners including the advertising of their services. As I have  conveyed in my Written Reply of 13 June 2019 and as has been discussed by the Cost of insurance Working Group, the specific regulation of 'claims harvesters', who use notoriously evasive tactics while operating on-line both nationally and internationally, is a complex challenge which remains for possible resolution as part of the wider regulation of the insurance sector.</p></reply>

This approach is aligned with the Divisional-focussed Garda model. It is the intention of the Commissioner that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide Divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) specifically called for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation. An industry-funded Garda insurance fraud unit was one option considered in this regard. While the Commissioner has indicated that he does not support industry funding of Garda units, he is open to considering other industry-funded proposals to combat insurance fraud, for example, IT projects and/or the appointment of analysts.</p></reply>

Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act specifically relate to DAHR procedures carried out in the State where the intending mother is also the birth mother and the child is born in the State.  Parts 2 and 3 contain provisions relating to the consent of parties to DAHR procedures (both donors and intending parents); the parentage of donor-conceived children born after the commencement of Parts 2 and 3; the rights of donor-conceived people to access information about their genetic heritage through the establishment of a National Donor-Conceived Person Register; and the use of non-anonymous gametes and embryos in assisted human reproduction involving donated material. Provision is also made for the granting by a court of a retrospective declaration of parentage in relation to a child born in the State as a result of a DAHR procedure (where the donor is unknown) before commencement of Parts 2 and 3, subject to certain conditions.  No provision of Parts 2 and 3 has yet been commenced.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is responsible for the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and associated regulations. He has informed me that his officials are continuing to work, alongside the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, on completing the outstanding elements necessary to enable commencement of Parts 2 and 3. </p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  Most of these amendments are for the purpose of enabling the registration of the birth of a child born as a result of a DAHR procedure, as defined under Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act. Part 9 amends the 2004 Act to include a definition of &ldquo;parent&rdquo; in relation to a child born as a result of a DAHR procedure to which Parts 2 and 3 apply. </p>  <p>  The Civil Registration Act 2019, which was signed into law on 23 May 2019, provides for amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004, including some amendments to address technical issues regarding the wording of some sections of Part 9 of the 2015 Act. </p>  <p>  No provision of Part 9 of the 2015 Act has yet been commenced.  Section 1(7) of the 2015 Act, as amended by section 12 of the Civil Registration Act 2019, provides that Part 9 shall come into operation 54 months from enactment or on such earlier day or days as the Minister for Justice and Equality may, after consulting with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, appoint by order.  Different days may be appointed for the commencement of different provisions of Part 9.  The provisions of Part 9 of the 2015 Act relating to the registration of the birth of donor-conceived children are so closely interlinked with and dependent on Parts 2 and 3 that those provisions of Part 9 cannot be operated until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  </p></reply>

The Government has made improved access to home support services a priority. This is reflected in the ongoing additional investment made in these services in recent years with the budget growing from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019. That is about a 45% increase in the annual budget for home support.</p><p>In 2018, the total budget for the service was &euro;416.8 million, providing over 17.5 million hours. In 2019 almost &euro;30 million has been added to the home support budget. This year the HSE intends to provide over 18.2 million home support hours, including intensive home care packages, to over 53,000 people. When one looks at the year-on-year targets, this means that this year&rsquo;s National Service Plan aims to deliver about 800,000 more hours than the 2018 target. I expect the HSE to deliver on this service plan commitment.</p><p>The allocation of funding for home supports, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available. The Home Support Service is not demand led and is therefore operated in line with agreed budgetary limits and targets as set out in the HSE National Service Plan.</p><p>To achieve compliance with its funding allocation, the HSE must ensure that the value of the total number of hours provided does not exceed the budget. This means that the HSE has to manage its service delivery over the course of the year to align with the total funding available. It also has a responsibility to ensure that activity is planned so as to anticipate critical demand pressures, most particularly emergency pressures in the initial and latter parts of the year.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, I am meeting senior HSE representatives this week to further discuss the delivery of home support in the context of the National Service Plan and I am happy to keep colleagues updated on the issue. </p><p>The cost of compliance with the decision referred to by the Deputy is a service matter and I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The patient should contact their own UK National Contact Point (NCP) to check their eligibility for CBD healthcare in any particular circumstance and the particular pathway they should take to avail of such healthcare.</p><p>  With regard to accessing the service in another Member State, the Cross Border Directive obliges Member States, through their own NCP, to ensure that information about healthcare providers is available, or accessible, to oversea patients.  The patient may contact the Irish NCP in writing at HSE National Contact Point (NCP), St Canices, Laken, Dublin Road, Kilkenny, R95 P231 or by phone on 056 7784546. The choice of healthcare provider is an individual choice for the patient.  Once the patient has chosen a healthcare provider for receipt of the cross border healthcare it is a requirement for individual healthcare providers to give them the relevant information to assist them in making an informed choice as to whether or not to avail of cross border healthcare.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.</p>  <p>  The joint Department of Health/HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The plan includes a target to reduce the number of patients waiting for and Inpatient/Day Case procedure from just over 70,000 in December 2018 to 60,000 by year end and to reduce the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. The latter target takes into account the fact that more than 800,000 new patients will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019, a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. </p>  <p>  The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of outpatient appointments approved to date relate to 4 high-volume specialties, specifically Ophthalmology, ENT, Orthopaedics, and Dermatology. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.</p>  <p>  In relation to the plans to reduce waiting times at Midlands Regional Hospital, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The NSP provides that over &euro;1.8 billion is available to support Older Persons Services this year.</p><p>Home supports enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities, as well as facilitating timely discharge from hospital. The Government has made improved access to home support services a priority. This is reflected in the ongoing additional investment made in these services in recent years with the budget growing from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019. That is about a 45% increase in the annual budget for home support.</p><p>In 2018, the total budget for the service was &euro;416.8 million, providing over 17.5 million hours. In 2019 almost &euro;30 million has been added to the home support budget. The additional funding provided this year recognises additional cost in providing existing levels of service and the provision of additional support hours.  This year the HSE intends to provide over 18.2 million home support hours, including intensive home care packages, to over 53,000 people. When one looks at the year-on-year targets, this means that this year&rsquo;s National Service Plan aims to deliver about 800,000 more hours than the 2018 target.</p><p>The allocation of funding for home supports, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available. The Home Support Service is not demand led and is therefore operated in line with agreed budgetary limits and targets as set out in the HSE National Service Plan.</p><p>To achieve compliance with its funding allocation, the HSE must ensure that the value of the total number of hours provided does not exceed the budget. This means that the HSE has to manage its service delivery over the course of the year to align with the total funding available. It also has a responsibility to ensure that activity is planned so as to anticipate critical demand pressures, most particularly emergency pressures in the initial and latter parts of the year.</p><p>I have asked the HSE to reply directly in relation to the operational aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

In addition, the sector will also deliver an additional 26.8 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq through better land use management such as afforestation and improved management of peaty grasslands.  </p><p>The plan identifies 34 actions for the sector that will contribute to our transition to a low carbon economy and society across abatement measures, carbon sequestration measures and displacement of fossil fuels and reflects our three pillar policy approach to achieving carbon neutrality without comprising sustainable food production of: </p><p>1.  Reducing agricultural emissions;</p><p>2. Increasing carbon sequestration; and</p><p>3. Displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. </p><p>These actions in the plan are informed by the recent Teagasc Marginal Cost Abatement Curve report (MACC) - <i>An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030</i>as an identifiable suite of actions for delivery. These actions include both efficiency measures such as the Dairy EBI programme and technical measures such as changes in fertiliser type or low emissions slurry spreading as well as a series of forestry and bioeceonomy measures.</p><p>Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs) are very beneficial in terms of identifying the most cost-effective ways of meeting the targets both within and between sectors and also in identifying options that cost less than the marginal benefit from abatement. MACCs provide a useful framework to engage stakeholders on opportunities to reduce emissions. However, the total amount of abatement achieved will be highly dependent on the uptake of mitigation innovations. These innovations have been well researched and proven under Irish conditions and are now considered to be best practice by our Farm Advisory Service.</p><p>While the target for the sector is challenging, immediate action and early adoption is key and there are three important actions that can be advanced immediately.</p><p>-  Deepening engagement with farmers and other stakeholders to promote the necessary deployment of new technologies and changes in farming practices. </p><p>-  Improving nitrogen use efficiency such as widespread adoption of low emissions slurry spreading or introduction of clover in grassland swards; and</p><p>-  Continuing our support for research and innovation such as the potential of novel feed additives in grass based production systems. </p><p>I will work to ensure that the next Common Agriculture Policy is aligned with this ambition and that climate action is mainstreamed in the development of our CAP strategic plan to ensure the delivery of this target.  While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.</p><p>The Teagasc MACC identified an abatement potential (annual savings in emissions) of 1.85 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq per year from agriculture between 2021 to 2030 (including those measures at a cost of over &euro;50 per tonne), 2.97 MtCO2eq from land use change (carbon sequestration), and energy saving and fossil fuel displacement of 1..37 MtCO2 eq which combined delivers a 6.19 Mt CO2e per annum saving for the periods 2021-2030 at a net cost (including efficiency savings) of circa &euro;34 million per annum.</p></reply>

In 2010 the Department conducted a review of the Disabled Parking Scheme, in consultation with various stakeholders and one of the issues examined was eligibility for the scheme.  As a result of the review the scheme was revised so that permits are now given on the basis of mobility impairment rather than the diagnosis of a particular condition or illness.  This is in line with the original intention of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The possibility of extending the eligibility criteria for the scheme to include people with invisible disabilities such as those mentioned by the Deputy has been raised on a number of occasions and the Department has consulted extensively with the joint issuing authorities of the scheme, the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland (DDAI) and the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWC), on this matter.   In light of this consultation there are currently no plans to change the criteria.</p>  <p>  I would particularly emphasise to the Deputy that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would in fact put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces in general.</p></reply>

In this way the mandate of the Forum can be refined to further enhance the State's engagement with former residents. The Forum itself also suggested a revisiting of these matters. </p>  <p>  I am currently examining how best to conduct a focused interim evaluation which involves the Forum members and considers important issues relating to the Forum's composition and mandate.   </p>  <p>  Delivering its first report within 6 months was a significant achievement and reflected the strong commitment and dedication of Forum members to this task.  It was understandable therefore that the former Chair and a small number of members signalled their intention to step down when the first report had been finalised and they have subsequently done so. I am actively considering a suitable appointments to these current vacancies to ensure the continuity of the process. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Government Ministers regularly seeks legal advice from the Attorney General in the context of decisions on the publication of any report. Following its consideration of the Attorney's advices, the Government decided that the full report of the Collaborative Forum could not be published ahead of the Commission of Investigation's final report.  Instead, as an initial step, I published the full set of recommendations made by the Forum in its report.  </p>  <p>  The Commission is due to deliver its final report by February 2020. At that time, I will reconsider publication of the Forum's report subject to any further advices of the Attorney General. I have sent a copy of the full report to the Commission of Investigation for its appropriate attention and consideration in the context of its statutory investigations.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to advancing consideration of the report and a comprehensive analysis of the recommendations by relevant Departments continues to be developed.</p></reply>

At that point &euro;61.8 million had transferred into the fund from dormant accounts within relevant financial institutions and a total of &euro;10.6 million had been reclaimed from the fund. Therefore, the net value of transfers into the fund for 2019 to the end of May was &euro;51.2 million. </p>  <p>  With regard to expenditure on measures approved in Dormant Account Fund Action Plans, as the Deputy is aware, measures approved in Action Plans subsequently require voted Government expenditure to be made available. For 2019 the total voted expenditure dedicated to Dormant Accounts measures across relevant Government Departments was &euro;39 million. The delivery of these measures is a matter for each relevant Department. Within my own Department the total voted allocation for Dormant Accounts measures in 2019 is &euro;12.057 million and, to date, expenditure of &euro;1.76 million has been incurred. As in 2018 my Department intends to spend the full allocation in 2019.</p>  <p>  Finally, at the end of May 2019, the balance in the fund was &euro;340.87 million and the reserve fund stood at &euro;94.62 million. Commitments made in Dormant Accounts Action Plans have a total liability of &euro;60.67 million. Therefore, the amount of uncommitted funds at the end of May 2019 stood at &euro;185.57 million.

This is the group of jobseekers facing the most significant barriers to entering full-time employment.</p>  <p>  My Department selects clients for the JobPath service by means of a random selection process. Protocols for selection currently preclude the selection of anyone who has already completed 52 weeks with the JobPath service within the previous four months.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p><p>My Department provides a range of supports to those who are caring for family members, friends or neighbours.  These measures aim to recognise the needs of carers through the provision of appropriate income supports, to enable carers to remain in touch with the labour market to the greatest extent possible and to empower carers to participate fully in economic and social life.</p><p>These income supports include the following:</p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Allowance </p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Benefit </p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant</p><p>- Domiciliary Care Allowance </p><p>Carers may also (subject to certain conditions) qualify for the Household Benefits Package and a Free Travel Pass.</p><p>Spending on these payments in 2019 is expected to exceed &euro;1.2 billion.</p><p>Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention on a full time basis.  The means test for Carer's Allowance is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;35,400 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate carer's allowance is also payable with other welfare payments e.g. pensions and disability payments.</p><p>The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.</p><p>Based on the number of carers identified as part of Census 2016, it is estimated that a universal carer&rsquo;s payment could cost up to &euro;1.2 billion per annum.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This information is available on the Agency's website at the following link: <i></i>.</p><p>A Review of the MTR scheme, published on 8 February 2017, introduced a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the scheme in order to improve its operation.  The Review, which is available at <i></i>, explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  The eligibility requirements of the scheme were widened to include a greater number of borrowers and a larger number of property types.  Increasing awareness and understanding of the scheme has been a priority and a new website,  <i>www.mortgagetorent.ie</i>, dedicated to guiding and advising borrowers has been developed.  In addition, new structures and arrangements have been put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.</p><p>While it will continue to be the case that not all MTR applications will develop into completed transactions for varied reasons, the implementation of the resulting actions from the Review means that MTR is available to provide a long-term solution for more households in mortgage distress, where appropriate.</p><p>The Abhaile service is a national mortgage arrears resolution service, provided free of charge to  mortgage holders in arrears and its aim is to help these borrowers to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best solution for their particular situation.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076)1072000 or by accessing their website at: <i>www.mabs.ie/abhaile</i>.</p></reply>

The reintroduction of a large predator which has been absent for almost 250 years is particularly challenging: the wolf is a large, mobile and adaptable predator. Wolves travel in packs and require vast home ranges.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has noted, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (the IUCN) have developed Guidelines on Reintroductions and Conservation Translocations. These guidelines were developed by conservation experts and practitioners and they provide the benchmark for international best practice in this field.</p>  <p>  Before going into the details of what a reintroduction programme might entail, the IUCN document  sets out an initial checklist for those considering a reintroduction project. One of the first requirements is that: </p>  <p>  &ldquo;There should &hellip;. be strong evidence that the threats that caused any previous extinction have been &hellip; removed.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  The National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service of my Department have advised me that any feasibility assessment for the reintroduction of the wolf to Ireland would fall at this first hurdle.</p>  <p>The wolf became extinct in Ireland towards the end of the 18th century. Its demise was brought about by a number of factors including deforestation, the expansion of agriculture, and persecution. There is limited evidence that those causes of its previous extinction have been removed.</p>  <p>  While the area under forestry in Ireland has been expanding, at approximately 11% it remains amongst the very lowest in Europe. Meanwhile, the area under agriculture has continued to expand and has also become more intensive and less hospitable to wildlife. </p>  <p>In addition, our urban and suburban areas have expanded significantly since the end of the 18th century.  The current challenges faced by the native pine marten, a relatively small and unthreatening predator compared to a wolf, as well as the ongoing poisoning and shooting of reintroduced birds of prey, indicate that the threat of persecution, particularly for a large predator, remains a concern.</p></reply>
