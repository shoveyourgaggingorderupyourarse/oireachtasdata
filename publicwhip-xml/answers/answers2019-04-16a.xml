It is nearly always carried out on minors.  Approximately 3.6 million girls are at risk of being subjected to FGM in any given year.  According to a recent World Health Organisation report, there are 200 million girls and women in 30 countries affected by FGM. While there has been an overall decline in the prevalence of FGM in the last three decades, not all countries have made progress and the pace of change has been uneven.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland co-sponsored resolutions in the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly calling for the intensification of efforts to eliminate FGM.  Ireland also provides support to a number of UN agencies, including UNICEF and UNFPA to address this issue. UNFPA and UNICEF jointly lead the largest global programme to accelerate the abandonment of FGM which currently focuses on 17 African countries with the highest prevalence of FGM. The programme supports the development of legislation outlawing FGM; funds community and media education initiatives on FGM; and provides training to improve health care services for those affected.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the European Union and the UN are collaborating on a new, global initiative - the Spotlight Initiative - focusing on eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls, with an emphasis on  specific regions. In Africa, the Spotlight Initiative is concentrating on sexual and gender based violence and harmful practises such as FGM as well as addressing links to sexual reproductive health and rights. </p></reply>

Mozambique has been particularly badly affected, with an estimated 1.85m people affected. </p>  <p>  Ireland has to date directly allocated over &euro;2.3 million to the crisis response across the region, including contributions to the International Federation of the Red Cross, the World Food Programme, the air lifting of life-saving relief supplies to Mozambique, and funding to Irish NGOs for emergency response. </p>  <p>  Given the particular level of need in Mozambique, we have allocated over &euro;1.9 million to the crisis response in the country to date. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Mozambique is working with partners on the ground in response to the crisis, and will continue its work to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme in Mozambique supports the most vulnerable now and in the future. </p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes to humanitarian response through our support to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund. Ireland has been one of the top ten donors to this Fund since its creation in 2005, and contributed &euro;10 million in 2019. $20 million funding from CERF was released immediately following the impact of Cyclone Idai, ensuring that an international humanitarian response could be implemented quickly. </p>  <p>  As a Member State of the EU, Ireland also directly contributes to EU humanitarian assistance. We welcome the allocation of over &euro;15 million by the EU to the humanitarian response to Cyclone Idai. </p></reply>

Rules with regard to ensuring a level playing field would also apply. Northern Ireland would remain aligned to those rules of the Single Market that are indispensable to avoiding a hard border. As regards the movement of animals and agricultural products between North and South, this would provide for complete regulatory alignment, including with respect to sanitary and pyhtosanitary (SPS) controls, and rules on agricultural production and marketing. </p>  <p>  It remains our priority to achieve a future relationship agreement that can resolve all these issues, and obviate the need for the backstop.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the Political Declaration agreed between the EU and the UK, cooperation in the area of agriculture and trade in agri-food products have been identified as important aspects of the future trading relationship. Ireland wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including in the area of trade, and in particular as regards agriculture and trade in agri-foods. This will be a priority for us in negotiations on the future relationship.</p></reply>

This is a priority for the Government given its importance for Irish exporters and importers as a means of access to the rest of the single market, in particular with regard to agri-food products. This is an important issue with regard to protecting the competitiveness of our producers and ensuring continued unhampered access to the EU Single Market.</p>  <p>  Retaining the effective use of the landbridge post-Brexit has been discussed at both political and official level with the UK and the EU. As a result of these contacts, the importance of maintaining the landbridge has been recognised through the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement. This reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate the efficient and timely transit through the UK of goods moving from Ireland to another EU Member State or another country, or vice versa.</p>  <p>  To this end, I welcome the EU's agreement that the UK will join the Common Transit Convention upon its departure from the EU, and that the formal process required for this to happen has concluded. The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Travel Convention will play an important role in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s access to other EU Member States via the UK landbridge. Work has been ongoing in partnership the European Commission and affected Member States with regard to the Union's internal transit procedures and infrastructural solutions at EU ports to facilitate transit post-Brexit and is progressing well, though the risk of delays in a no deal Brexit scenario remains a concern  notably on the Dover-Calais route.</p></reply>

Ireland, along with our EU partners, has repeatedly called on President Maduro to acknowledge the full scale of the humanitarian crisis. Reports of ongoing serious human rights violations in Venezuela, including a growing risk of violence, are also deeply troubling. </p>  <p>  The EU has provided &euro;117m in assistance  since 2018. Ireland fully supports the efforts of the EU's International Contact Group (ICG) to enable urgent delivery of humanitarian aid in line with humanitarian principles.  I also welcome the establishment of the UN coordination mechanism for the delivery of aid in the country.</p>  <p>  The International Contact Group aims to facilitate a peaceful, democratic solution to the crisis, by seeking to put in place conditions to allow for a political process to take place. It is important to note that the ICG, whose membership includes EU MS and countries from the region, is currently the only international diplomatic mechanism that is engaging with both sides and all stakeholders. I welcome its progress to date and fully support its important work. At its most recent meeting on 28 March, it reaffirmed that the multiple crisis affecting Venezuela can only have a political, peaceful, democratic and Venezuelan-owned solution, excluding the use of force, through the holding of free, transparent and credible presidential elections as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The EU has also put in place targeted sanctions, including an embargo on arms, and targeted measures against those responsible for human rights violations, and undermining democracy and the rule of law. </p>  <p>  On 6 February, Ireland joined the vast majority of other EU MS in acknowledging and supporting Mr. Guaid&oacute;, President of the democratically elected National Assembly, as President ad interim of Venezuela, in order for him to call for free, fair and democratic presidential elections. This remains the position of 24 EU Member States, including Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to bringing about a peaceful solution that gives the Venezuelan people the opportunity to decide their own future through democratic elections, in line with international standards. Venezuela was discussed on 8 April at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting and I will continue to engage on Venezuela at future meetings.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-16a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041600056#WRA02600"><p>I and my Government colleagues regret that it did not prove possible to secure passage of the Irish E3 Visa Bill in December, during the last term of the outgoing US Congress. That Bill, if passed, would have provided for an important new legal pathway for Irish citizens to live, work and make a valuable contribution in the US.</p>  <p>  While this was disappointing news for all who care about the Ireland-US relationship, it is important to acknowledge the strong support received from many quarters for Ireland's position on securing a legal pathway for Irish citizens wishing to live and work in the US - support which is testament to the depth and strength of our transatlantic relationship. </p>  <p>  Following my meetings in Washington DC in February, and the Taoiseach's meetings over the St. Patrick's Day period, it is our hope that an E3 Bill will be reintroduced in the US House of Representatives in the coming weeks, and possibly sooner.  Should that be the case, the Bill will need to sucessfully advance through the same process, as undertaken at the end of last year. It would therefore need a majority to pass the US House of Representatives and would need no votes against in the US Senate.  This will again be a difficult task, with no guarantee of success.  Given the importance of this issue for the continued development of the Ireland-US relationship, my Department, including through our Embassy in Washington D.C., and Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, John Deasy T.D., will once again work together to ensure the passage of the Bill on this occasion. </p></reply>

Ireland's concerns about the situation in Xinjiang are also raised in our contacts with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin and through our Embassy in Beijing.</p>  <p>  Ireland participated in China&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR), which was held in November 2018.  As well as expressing concern at reports of the treatment of ethnic Uighurs, in particular their detention in political re-education camps, we urged China to respect freedom of religion and belief and recommended that China grant access to the OHCHR to all regions of the country including Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The EU also continues to raise concerns regarding freedom of religion and belief at bilateral and multilateral levels. The topic was raised during the most recent EU-China Summit held on the 9 April, and was discussed in more detail during the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue on the 1 April. During this dialogue the EU noted that while actions to counter terrorism are essential, such measures must respect the principle of proportionality, fundamental freedoms and international laws. The EU raised the system of political re-education camps and called on China to allow meaningful, unsupervised and unrestricted access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special Procedures. </p>  <p>  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in March, the EU raised concerns about the existence of political re-education camps and widespread surveillance and restrictions particularly targeted at Uighurs in Xinjiang, and again urged China to allow meaningful access to Xinjiang for independent observers. Ireland fully supports the EU position, and actively contributes to its actions and statements.</p></reply>

The study has just recently been finalised and is available on my Department's website.  It identifies gaps in the current provision and makes a number of recommendations that will be examined by the Implementation Group.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland supports the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights, which brings together different stakeholders, including business and civil society, to share experiences and lessons learned regarding the promotion of responsible business practice.  We will continue to engage with the Forum and look forward to the next meeting in November 2019.</p></reply>

As a contracting party, Israel is bound by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). I am not satisfied that Israel is meeting its obligations under these Conventions. </p>  <p>  All children subject to Israeli jurisdiction and criminal justice, including in territory occupied by Israel, should be afforded the same protections under the law as Israel considers appropriate for Israeli children. </p>  <p>  During my visits to Israel and Palestine, I raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the detention of minors directly with the Israeli authorities, including on the practices of night-time arrests and blindfolding. I have strongly urged the Israeli authorities to use detention only as a last resort, and for the shortest possible period of time, in the case of minors, as stipulated in the CRC.</p>  <p>  The Israeli military court system, which is used only in relation to Palestinians in the Occupied Territory, including children, has a near-one hundred percent conviction rate, a statistic which raises serious questions about the system&rsquo;s compliance with international standards of due process.  Ireland has recommended that Israel should urgently end the admissibility of evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation.</p>  <p>  In the most recent UN Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review of Israel in 2018, Ireland drew attention to concerns regarding the treatment of Palestinian prisoners. Ireland raised the issue of administrative detention and recommended that Israel ensure full respect for international human rights obligations. Ireland has also raised these issues at EU level. In February 2019, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on EU Priorities in UN human rights fora, which reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to the full implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Protocols worldwide. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support a number of key Palestinian and Israeli NGOs in their work on the monitoring, advocacy and legal defence of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. </p></reply>

This is a breach of a central principle of international law, which will have unfortunate repercussions well beyond the immediate context of the Golan Heights. Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter. This is a fundamental principle of the relation of States and the rule of law in the modern world. </p>  <p>  This decision by the United States in relation to the Golan Heights is an unhelpful step at a critical juncture in the conflict. I made clear in a statement on 25 March that Ireland continues to regard the Golan Heights as Syrian territory occupied by Israel. The EU also issued a statement which affirmed that in line with international law and UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 497, the European Union does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights.</p>  <p>  I also made my views clear in December 2017 on the US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It has been the united position of the international community for decades that a resolution of the Middle East conflict will include agreement for Jerusalem to be the capital of both Israel and the future state of Palestine. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to believe that the best way to achieve a just and lasting solution to this conflict is through substantive negotiations between all interlocutors, resolving all issues of disagreement, and leading to the development of a two-state solution.  Contributing to the advancement of the Middle East Peace Process is a priority of the Government, and it is an issue to which I have dedicated a great deal of time since assuming my role, most recently by holding a Foreign Ministers&rsquo; Retreat in February. I am committed to continuing my efforts to support positive change in the region. </p></reply>

This represented an increase of more than 10% on the previous year. We expect the number of passport applications to continue to increase throughout 2019.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently in its peak season for passport demand with the vast majority of applications being received between February and August each year. At present, renewal applications received through the Online Passport Renewal Service are being processed within the target turnaround time of 10 working days plus postage time. The current processing times for postal applications submitted through Passport Express depend on the category of application. Renewal applications are currently being processed within the target turnaround time of 15 working days plus postage time. First-time applications and applications from citizens who are applying to replace a lost, stolen or damaged passport are being processed in 17 working days plus postage time, 3 days ahead of the target turnaround time of 20 working days. In the last 2 months, the Passport Service's dedicated Customer Service Hub has dealt with almost 6,500 enquiries each week through its phone and web-chat channels.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken by the Passport Service to manage the increase in demand and to ensure that they are meeting and exceeding turnaround times. Measures taken include the recruitment of additional staff, the continuous implementation of technological and service improvements and the re-organisation of production processes and administrative arrangements.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2018, the Passport Service employed 363.2 Full Time Equivalent staff. This is an increase of over 40 staff since the same point in 2017. Already this year, over 60 additional Full Time Equivalent staff have taken up roles in the Passport Service. Targeted overtime has been sanctioned for both permanent and temporary staff when required.  The Passport Service has received approval to recruit over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) in 2019 to assist in processing passport applications and to deal with the queries from the general public. A dedicated Customer Service Hub has been established to deal with queries from the public and additional staff have been allocated. By the end of this month the number of officers answering Customer Service queries will have trebled since 2016.</p>  <p>  The Passport Reform Programme continues to deliver major upgrades to the Passport Service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements. The award winning Online Passport Renewal Service has been the most significant project launched under the Programme to date. The second phase of the Online Passport Renewal Service was rolled out in November 2018. The online facility now allows for the renewal of children's passports and has expanded the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. The online service brings significant benefits to citizens with faster turnaround times and greater customer satisfaction. The online service has been instrumental in the management of overall passport operations and in allowing the passport service to allocate staff resources more efficiently to cope with unprecedented demand.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is satisfied that the combination of service improvements, upgrades to the technology platforms and increased staff allocations will be sufficient to meet anticipated demand during this year&rsquo;s peak season.</p></reply>

Citizens must be allowed to exercise their democratic rights and freedoms. </p>  <p>  I would also reiterate my concern at the arrest and detention of elected officials and members of parliament, including pro-Kurdish HDP politicians. It is critically important that the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are respected. I have also expressed my concern at the conditions in which those in detention are held. </p>  <p>  It is clear that the Turkish-Kurdish conflict can only be resolved through the resumption of peaceful and constructive dialogue between the two sides.

As I have previously stated, it is absolutely not acceptable for women to be imprisoned, let alone mistreated, for peacefully pursuing their basic human rights.</p>  <p>  The cases of the remaining women, and allegations of mistreatment of women detainees, are being monitored closely by the Irish Embassy in Riyadh, in coordination with other EU Member States. The EU delegation in Riyadh has raised the cases directly with the Saudi authorities on multiple occasions.</p>  <p>  Ireland consistently raises issues of human rights in Saudi Arabia both bilaterally with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin, and in international fora.</p>  <p>  Ireland signed a joint statement at the UN Human Rights Council last month, along with all EU Member States, calling on Saudi Arabia to release individuals detained for exercising their fundamental freedoms, including ten named women human rights defenders. The recent preliminary release of three women, including two of the named human rights defenders, was a welcome development.</p>  <p>  Thematically, Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees, and is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Human Rights Council Resolution 36/16, which Ireland co-sponsored, calls upon states to &lsquo;investigate promptly, effectively and impartially all alleged human rights violations and abuses suffered by persons deprived of their liberty, in particular cases involving death, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to provide effective remedies to the victims, and to ensure that detention administrations cooperate fully with the investigating authority and preserve all evidence&rsquo;. Ireland has co-sponsored thematic Resolutions in the Human Rights Council concerning human rights in the administration of justice and concerning torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

On 3 April, the State Department announced it would suspend application of Title III for a further two weeks.</p>  <p>  This development has been noted by Ireland and our EU partners. The Helms-Burton Act has been discussed on several occasions at the EU Council Working Party on Transatlantic Relations (COTRA) at which Ireland has been represented at official level. My officials are in close contact with the EU Commission on this matter and are monitoring the situation closely.</p>  <p>  This issue has also been raised in contacts between officials from my Department and the Ambassador of Cuba to Ireland. Officials have reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding position on the US embargo against Cuba, which I have also expressed publicly on a number of occasions. Ireland believes that the embargo serves no constructive purpose and that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people. In addition, we and our EU partners are not persuaded that the continued embargo is contributing in a positive way to the democratic transition in Cuba.</p>  <p>  Together with our EU partners, Ireland has firmly and continuously opposed extraterritorial measures that seek to extend the US embargo against Cuba to third countries as contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade. Our position in this regard was set out most recently at the UN General Assembly on 1 November last year in the context of the resolution on the necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the US against Cuba.</p></reply>

I add Ireland's voice to that of the EU and many other international partners in expressing our grave concern at these developments and call on Brunei to take urgent steps to ensure it upholds its international human rights obligations. </p>  <p>  Some of the punishments provided for in this criminal code amount to torture, acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which are prohibited by the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, signed by Brunei-Darussalam in 2015. As well as going against the 2012 ASEAN Human Rights Declaration, these punishments may also breach Brunei's obligations as a party to the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific provisions referred to by the Deputies, Ireland is committed to promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI+) individuals, who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and face systemic discrimination in many countries. In both our bilateral and multilateral engagement on human rights, Ireland focuses on ensuring individuals&rsquo; human rights and non-discrimination, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. </p>  <p>  Irish Consulates and Embassies overseas cooperate closely with EU delegations and Embassies of the other EU Member States to advocate for the rights of LGBTI+ persons, including advocating for the decriminalisation of homosexuality where it exists, and against its criminalisation where this is contemplated. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland also raises the rights of LGBTI+ individuals at international level through our work at the United Nations and the European Union as well as our engagement in regional organisations such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE. </p>  <p>  Our diplomatic network also actively supports LGBTI+ rights by participating in Gay Pride parades and similar events across the world.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, Ireland reaffirms its strong and unequivocal opposition to capital punishment in all circumstances and for all cases. Ireland expects Brunei-Darussalam to maintain its de facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty. </p>  <p>  Finally, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva we will take the opportunity of the upcoming Universal Periodic Review of Brunei-Darussalam next month to call on their Government to abide by its international and regional human rights commitments and obligations.</p></reply>

Following a legal challenge, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment in February 2018 determining that the existing fisheries agreement and the protocol implementing the agreement were not applicable to the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Council of the European Union authorised the European Commission to begin negotiations to amend the fisheries agreement and its associated protocol with a view to providing a legal basis to grant preferences to products originating in Western Sahara. As part of this process, the European Commission and the European External Action Service conducted a wide-ranging consultation process with key stakeholders from Western Sahara. This process concluded that, while some parties objected to an agreement in principle, a majority favoured a new fisheries agreement. The consultation also found that a new agreement would be economically beneficial to local people in the region. Following those negotiations, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement, and a new Implementation Protocol were initialled, which the European Parliament and Council have since adopted.</p>  <p>  In its discussions with EU partners, Ireland consistently emphasised the need for any agreement to be consistent with the judgment of the Court of Justice. My Department has received assurances from the Council Legal Service of the EU that the new agreement respects both international law and the Court of Justice's judgment.</p>  <p>  I must stress that the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco is entirely without prejudice to the position of the EU on Western Sahara. In other words, there is nothing in the terms of the agreement or its protocol which would imply EU recognition of Morocco&rsquo;s sovereignty or sovereign rights over Western Sahara and the adjacent waters.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU continue to recognise the United Nation&rsquo;s classification of Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory. Ireland supports the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, but does not have a view on the outcome of that decision, be it independence, integration, autonomy, or some other solution &ndash; so long as it is decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU fully support the ongoing UN efforts to assist the parties in reaching a lasting political resolution to the dispute. I welcome the second UN-mediated roundtable meeting on Western Sahara that was held last month in Geneva. This is as a very positive step by all parties, and I hope that it will lead to the renewal of the negotiations process. This is the only path towards a sustainable resolution of the conflict which is mutually acceptable, and provides for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p></reply>

This was once again reiterated by partners, including at the highest levels, in the lead up to the European Council meeting on 10 April. Ireland and the EU are at one in our determination to do all we can, deal or no deal, to protect the peace process and to avoid a hard border.</p>  <p>  The strong solidarity from EU partners resulted in the endorsement of the Withdrawal Agreement by the European Council on 25 November 2018, which includes the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. This protcol fully addresses issues specific to this island and protects the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process.</p>  <p>  The Protocol underpins, in a dynamic way, continuing North-South cooperation and the all-island economy. It acknowledges the Common Travel Area, whereby Irish and British can live, work, study, and access healthcare, social security and public services in each other&rsquo;s jurisdictions. It includes commitments to ensure no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement, and that people in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens. Importantly, nothing in the Agreement will prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  A key element of the Protocol are the measures included for a backstop to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border. The EU-UK shared customs territory which would apply under the backstop will involve no tariffs or quotas, and includes well established rules with regard to ensuring a level playing field, including in the area of tax. Northern Ireland would remain aligned to those rules of the Single Market that are indispensable to avoiding a hard border.</p>  <p>  The backstop acts as an insurance policy, which we hope will never have to be used. It remains our priority to achieve a future relationship agreement that can resolve all these issues.  We are determined to work towards that best possible outcome. The Withdrawal Agreement provides for a period of transition, during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to the UK, which provides us with the time needed to negotiate an agreement on the future relationship.</p>  <p>  Without a Withdrawal Agreement, avoiding a hard border would become more complex and challenging. We have been working closely with the Commission over recent weeks on how we can work together to avoid a hard border, in the case of no deal, while also protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them. Any solutions in a no deal scenerio will be sub-optimal to the backstop and there would be serious disruption to the functioning of the all-island economy.</p>  <p>  This is why the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, is so important, and why we remain focussed on securing its ratification. It provides the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal, while fully protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the all-island economy. This is why in its conclusions of 10 April, the European Council made clear again that during the agreed extension to the Article 50 process, the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland cannot be re-negotiated.</p>  <p>  Maintaining our strong relationship with the UK is a priority for Ireland, and we want to see a future relationship between the EU and UK that is as deep and comprehensive as possible.  The ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement by the UK will enable both sides to move on to agreeing this new relationship.</p></reply>

Over 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding in 2018 was directed in support of those affected by conflict.</p>  <p>  Critical to maximising Ireland&rsquo;s response is our strong and enduring commitment to effective multilateralism, particularly through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations.  Ireland is a strong contributor not just to decisions regarding the international humanitarian response to crises but also to efforts to prevent conflict and to resolve conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a deep partnership with the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA.  OCHA coordinates and leads coherent and effective international responses to humanitarian crises.   </p>  <p>  Amongst other funds, OCHA manages the Central Emergency Response Fund, which responds to sudden onset disasters and to under-funded crises.  Ireland is a strong supporter of both mechanisms and the current chair of the OCHA donor support group, which works with the Office the UN Humanitarian Coordinator.  A key priority for Ireland as chair is to ensure that Ireland plays an effective international role on the protection of civilians and to uphold international humanitarian law.  In international forums, Ireland consistently advocates for adherence to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and calls on all parties &ndash; for example, those engaged in the Syria conflict &ndash; to fulfill their responsibility to protect civilians and to allow the safe passage of humanitarian assistance.  </p>  <p>  Promoting international peace and security in regions of conflict is a core mission of the United Nations. By necessity, United Nations authorised interventions are required in the most sensitive war zones.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a long tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts.  Ireland has maintained a continuous presence in UN peace support operations since 1958, and has more than 570 personnel in United Nations mandated missions overseas.  The Government is committed to participation in peace-keeping operations as a tangible contribution to the development of global peace and security.  This commitment informs Ireland&rsquo;s decision to seek election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the period 2021-22.  If elected, membership of the Security Council would allow Ireland to play an important influencing role in the international response to the needs of the most vulnerable.</p></reply>

Dublin and one located in the Passport Office in Mount Street, Dublin. All applications are processed through the centralised Automated Passport Service (APS).  This means that all production facilities can print a passport irrespective of what channel the application was processed.  This printing system allows for flexibility between printing machines if any one machine has reached capacity.</p>  <p>  The current three printing machines are meeting the Passport Service printing demands and have additional capacity.  Each Passport Printer has a printing capacity of 250 passports per hour and the printing requirements of the Passport Office in Cork are met by the machines in Balbriggan and Mount Street, without difficulty.  As the current machines are meeting and exceeding demands there are no plans to add a printing facility in the Cork office.</p>  <p>  Overall, in response to the growing demand for Irish passports, my Department has strengthened the capacity of the Passport Service by recruiting over 80 permanent staff to respond to the general increase in passport applications. the Passport Service has also obtained sanction for the recruitment of over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers.

With approximately fourteen months remaining until the election, An Taoiseach, I, in my capacity as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Ministers across Government, as well as Ministers of State, are actively promoting Ireland&rsquo;s candidature in our multilateral and bilateral engagements. </p>  <p>  During the recent St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, a very large number of engagements were undertaken by Ministers and senior officials which allowed us to raise awareness of our candidature.  They also increase the electorate's awareness of the principles and values informing our foreign policy, and our longstanding commitment to multilateralism and the rule of law.</p>  <p>  In making our case to the UN Member States, we are highlighting our consistent record at the UN throughout more than six decades of membership. Among the areas in which we have built a strong reputation at the UN are peacekeeping, sustainable development, humanitarian action, disarmament and human rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland last served on the Security Council for a two-year term in 2001-2002. In the intervening years, the understanding has grown among Member States that factors contributing to international peace and security are wide ranging and inter-related. Climate change, hunger, migration and access to natural resources are crucial issues which can determine the stability of societies, countries and entire sub-regions. The devastating and gendered impact of conflict of women and girls, and the unequal impact of conflict on youth, must be taken into account by the Security Council. We will highlight these issues, which we know Irish people view as important, during our campaign and, should we be elected, as members of the Security Council.</p>  <p>  I am aware that in February, officials from my Department were invited to brief Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on the status of the campaign. I understand that the Deputy was present and contributed to what was a positive and constructive discussion, which again demonstrated the strong support in the Oireachtas for Ireland's UN engagement.  I welcome the Committee&rsquo;s interest in Ireland's candidature and on how the its Members, and colleagues across the Oireachtas, can contribute to the campaign effort.</p></reply>

However, the CSO and the Government of Ireland (Commitment on Confidence in Statistics 2017)  has made an undertaking to ensure compliance with  the European Statistical System Code of Practice, (ESSCOP).

All new staff are subject to a one-year probationary period, in the course of which their technical aptitude for the role as well as their more general suitability for permanent appointment are assessed. </p><p>Corresponding essential academic requirements feature in all competitions for promotion to Senior Statistician. In addition, candidates for positions as Senior Statistician, a Divisional Manager role, are required to demonstrate the requisite level of skill across the broader range of senior management competencies associated with the Principal Officer grade, including leadership, relationship building, management and delivery of results, communication, judgement and decision making. </p><p>Empirically, the following documents the academic qualifications of current Statisticians and Senior Statisticians serving in the CSO:<table><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Primary Degree</th><th>Master or Equivalent</th><th>Doctorate</th></tr><tr><td>Senior Statistician</td><td>100%</td><td>89%</td><td>19%</td></tr><tr><td>Statistician</td><td>100%</td><td>85%</td><td>16%</td></tr></table></p><p>All CSO Statisticians and Senior Statisticians have passed through a rigorous recruitment process, which may include short-listing, preliminary and final interview stages and every competition at this level involves the use of external Interview Board members sitting alongside CSO interviewers of relevant grade. All CSO recruitment processes are formally documented and operate in line with CPSA Codes of Practice.</p><p>As part of delivering on its strategic plan CSO 2020, published in 2013, the CSO has invested in building dedicated statistical quality (new division) and methodology teams, leading on promotion and support of quality standards and advanced methodological methods throughout the statistical business areas.</p><p>Assurance on statistical outputs is provided by line managers, as well as the Quality Management Support and Assurance (QMSA) and Methodology teams.  All statistics submitted to Eurostat are subject to validation and scrutiny with additional checks arising from the Excessive Deficit Procedure and Gross National Income Audits. </p><p>The CSO invests continually in learning and development, committing to a substantial annual Learning &amp;amp; Development budget including a refund of fees scheme accessible to all permanent staff, and there is an open dialogue with staff members on learning needs as part of the annual business planning, objective setting and performance management processes.</p><p>The CSO maintains a staff skills register, to continuously profile the skills available within the Office, identifying gaps and supporting learning opportunities. </p><p>The CSO has developed a Statistical Training Framework which will provide training interventions to meet the 13 statistical skills headings based on the internationally recognised Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM) across the Irish Statistical System. This innovative training model is being adopted by other countries within Europe and it is also intended to make it available to other public bodies in Ireland with data analysis staff. </p><p>In early 2019, University College Dublin became the first Irish third level institution certified by the European Masters of Official Statistics(EMOS) Board of Eurostat to offer courses attracting the EMOS certification, following a lengthy period of engagement with the Central Statistics Office around the composition and delivery of such programmes.

I had a series of political discussions and meetings, including with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressmen Richie Neal and Peter King. </p>  <p>  In each meeting, we discussed the Ireland - US bilateral relationship, including the importance of the two-way economic relationship between us, as well as between the US and EU. </p>  <p>  I outlined the Government's position on the Brexit negotiations, and the importance of ensuring that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. As ever, there was clear and unambiguous backing, both within the Administration and across Congress, for the Northern Ireland Peace Process and the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  I highlighted the continuing problems facing the undocumented Irish in the US, and called for a speedy resolution of this issue. </p>  <p>  I also expressed the Government's appreciation for the strong backing both from the Administration and across the aisles in Congress for the E3 Bill last year, which we hope will be reintroduced shortly. I did not have an opportunity for detailed discussion of Climate Change issues during this visit. </p>  <p>  My programme in Washington D.C. also included a number of engagements with an economic focus, including events hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. At these events I met some of the Irish-owned companies which, in total, employ more than 100,000 workers in the US. I also met a number of US companies with significant investments in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I also attended a number of other St. Patrick's Day events including the White House reception; a breakfast hosted by Vice President Pence, and receptions hosted by the Irish Ambassador and by the Ireland Funds.</p>  <p>  In Chicago, I had a meeting with a number of emigrant support groups that receive Irish Government funding, and had the opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to finding a resolution to the status of the undocumented. </p>  <p>  I also met with political leaders including the Governor of Illinois, Jay Pritzker and Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, where we discussed bilateral relations and topical issues including Brexit.</p>  <p>  I attended Chicago's annual St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day events, including a dinner hosted by the Irish Fellowship Club, mass in Old St. Patrick's church, and the Chicago Parade. Finally, I launched Tourism Ireland's new publication marking the 10th anniversary of the Global Greening Initiative.</p>  <p>  This visit was an invaluable opportunity to promote Ireland&rsquo;s interests with the US Administration, and with political, business and community leaders, as well as to deepen the political, economic and cultural links between Ireland and the United States.</p></reply>

The Division advises me in my role as member of European Council, and in respect of Government consideration of Brexit issues, including negotiations, as well as Northern Ireland affairs and British-Irish relations. </p>  <p>  The Economic Division of my Department advises me in the development and implementation of national and sectoral economic policies to ensure economy is well placed to respond to opportunities and threats, including Brexit.</p>  <p>  To augment this ongoing work, my Department also has a dedicated unit on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning. This unit, working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, assists several groups that oversee Brexit preparations and contingency planning, and focuses on cross-Government co-ordination, planning and programme management.</p>  <p>  The unit provides assistance to a Secretaries General group, chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, which has been meeting weekly to oversee ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.</p>  <p>  The unit also assists a Senior Officials Group of Assistant Secretaries on no-deal Brexit planning, which has been meeting on a regular basis and focussing on planning for a no-deal scenario based on the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, also jointly chairs a Senior Officials Group on Brexit-related legislation, which oversaw development of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019, signed into law by the President on 17 March.

I had spoken to Prime Minister May by phone on the evening of 8 April, when we discussed her letter to Donald Tusk seeking an extension of the Article 50 deadline, and preparations for the European Council Summit on Wednesday 10 April. I repeated to PM May my openness to an extension of the Article 50 deadline.</p>  <p>  I welcome the agreement reached between the EU 27 and UK on the Brexit extension. I firmly believe that the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons is in all our interests, and I hope the time extension will enable the deal to be agreed.     </p>  <p>  I continue to believe that approval of the Withdrawal Agreement is the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border. I was pleased to have the continued backing of my fellow European Council members on this objective. </p>  <p>  We have been working closely with the European Commission and our EU partners to mitigate against the negative impact on our trade and economy, including through the development of contingency arrangements for the management of trade flows on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Government has repeatedly stated, this is based on the twin shared objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and ensuring the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it. As co-guarantors, the British and Irish Governments will continue to have obligations to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The decision of the European Council to extend Article 50 prevented a no-deal Brexit on 12 April. However, while the risk of a no-deal Brexit has significantly reduced, it unfortunately has not been fully averted and preparations by Government for all possible scenarios are therefore continuing.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan, published on 19 December 2018 and updated on 30 January 2019, sets out cross-Government preparations in train since even before the UK vote. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive set of Government structures is in place to ensure that all Departments and their agencies are engaged in detailed preparedness and contingency activities. Sector-specific plans are in place identifying important challenges associated with a no-deal Brexit and accompanying mitigation approaches.</p>  <p>  Our preparedness and contingency planning takes full account of, and complements preparation at EU level for a no-deal Brexit, which have been ongoing since December 2017. Irish and British officials are in close ongoing contact on all relevant issues</p></reply>

This involves the dedicated charter of a civilian aircraft for each movement of troops, which is arranged by the Department by way of a tender competition in line with public procurement regulations. When smaller numbers of personnel are travelling to and from missions, transport is generally by way of scheduled commercial flights. </p>  <p>  The UNDOF contingent is operating in a very challenging region where there can never be complete certainty on transit routes and where the administrative procedures relating to the transit of military personnel are complex and cut across a number of jurisdictions.  Approvals for the transit of foreign military forces, in a congested conflict zone, involve many governmental layers, and are, therefore, not without hazard.  While every effort is made to secure the necessary clearances on time, we do not have control over these and rely on the good offices of the States through which we are transiting.  We will continue to engage with these States.  However, given all the variables, it is not possible to guarantee rotation dates at this time with the requisite certainty, and personnel will be advised of this uncertainty when deploying in future.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides that Ireland's ongoing active participation in a range of peacekeeping and crisis management missions is a key policy requirement. While each mission has elements of danger, it is the Government's position that all actions should be taken to minimise threats to the safety of personnel. Armoured vehicles provide essential force protection and, in this context in accordance with the equipment planning process, the fleet of armoured vehicles is subject to regular review to ensure that it meets operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  Twenty four (24) 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in late 2017 and in 2018 the Defence Forces took delivery of ten (10) new armoured logistic vehicles. A multi-year mid-life upgrade of the Army's fleet of MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers is underway which will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. The first twenty (20) upgraded vehicles were recently delivered. Eight (8) more upgraded vehicles are due for delivery in the coming months. </p>  <p>  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a requirement for additional 4x4 armoured utility vehicles has been identified and subject to consideration of a business case and assessment of associated cost, funding will be made available. At this time there are no plans for the purchase of additional armoured logistic vehicles for the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, we are of the view that the UN Working Party on Business and Human Rights and the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights provide appropriate fora for consideration of any new initiatives.</p></reply>

The letter set out the work of Northern Ireland Departments across a range of sectors in advance of the UK leaving the EU and amplifies the UK Government assessment.  It notes that, despite the considerable amount of mitigation work that has been undertaken to date across NI Departments, Northern Ireland will face considerable and unavoidable residual risks, notably on the local economy in ways that cannot be mitigated in the case of a no deal.  </p>  <p>  I share the letter&rsquo;s assessment, including its stark warning about the changes to everyday life, potential border frictions and the potential for profound and long lasting impact on society. In my ongoing contacts with the political parties in Northern Ireland, I have discussed with them the impact of Brexit, and the deeply concerning potential issues around a no deal Brexit. I have also repeatedly discussed my concerns around the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland with my British counterparts. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the imperative of avoiding that scenario will continue to inform the Government&rsquo;s approach. Indeed from the outset, I have highlighted the socio-economic risks which Brexit poses for Northern Ireland as well as for the wider political situation there. I have repeatedly stated that a no deal Brexit is in no one&rsquo;s interests, least of all for the people of Northern Ireland who, as the report and letter confirm, will be most affected.</p>  <p>  We are absolutely determined to avoid physical infrastructure at the border, but in a no deal Brexit there will be implications regarding disruption to the functioning of the all-island economy. The seamless trade we enjoy today would not be possible, and the benefits of the backstop for businesses in Northern Ireland would be lost, at least in the short term. These risks only serve to further highlight the absolute need to agree the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

We have therefore consistently stated our wish to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and UK, including on trade. </p>  <p>  The Government has expressed a strong desire for the UK to remain in the Single Market and Customs Union. However, this is ultimately a decision for the UK. The UK Government has made clear its wish to leave the Single Market and Customs Union. The UK being outside the Customs Union and the Single Market will inevitably lead to frictions in trade, and will have negative economic consequences, in particular for the UK. </p>  <p>  We are aware that the UK's future trading relationship with the EU is the subject of ongoing discussions between the UK Government and the Labour Party, aimed at ensuring an orderly UK withdrawal from the EU. In these discussions, the Labour Party has proposed that a permament Customs Union is agreed between the EU and the UK. In its conclusions of 10 April 2019, the European Council again made clear that should the UK&rsquo;s position on the EU-UK future relationship evolve, the EU is prepared to reconsider the Political Declaration on the future relationship. </p>  <p>  A permanent EU-UK Customs Union would have significant advantages in terms of facilating trade between Ireland and the UK, a major market for Irish exports. Such a Customs Union would also go some way to avoiding a hard border on the island of island, including by avoiding the need to collect tariffs and to undertake other customs checks. However, regulatory alignment with certain rules of the EU Single Market is also required to avoid checks and controls, for example to ensure product safety or animal health standards. </p></reply>

The FAC has held wide ranging discussions with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, and the Director-General of the International Organisation for Migration, Ant&oacute;nio Vitorino.  </p>  <p>  Lead responsibility for migration policy in general, including issues within the EU,  rests with the Justice and Home Affairs Council, on which Ireland is represented by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality. In regard to the specific situation in Greece, there are approximately 14,500 refugees and migrants currently on the Aegean islands. This number, while very high, is still much lower than that in the earlier years of the migration crisis. According to the UNHCR, a total of 5,492 people have arrived in Greece by sea since the beginning of 2019. Over one-third of those arriving are children, with 15 percent of all children being registered as unaccompanied or separated. The majority of those reaching the Aegean islands arrive on Lesvos (which includes Moria camp) or Samos - both of which are experiencing overcrowding.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has granted over &euro;816.4 million in emergency assistance for the migrant situation in Greece since the beginning of 2015. The funding enabled the delivery of primary healthcare, better hygiene conditions and the construction of temporary housing for people in need. EU-funded projects also ensured the provision of food and other essentials such as sleeping bags, blankets, and personal hygiene items.  The emergency funding comes on top of the &euro;613.5 million already allocated to Greece under the national programmes for 2014-2020 (&euro;328.3 million from the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and &euro;285.2 million from the Internal Security Fund). </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Athens constantly monitors the situation in the camps and officials have visited Moria camp on a number of occasions. In December 2018, the Embassy provided funding of &euro;10,000 to a local NGO, METAdrasi, to support informal education activities for children resident in Moria camp. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Charlie Flanagan T.D. has announced that Ireland would accept up to 36 unaccompanied minors from camps in Greece and it is expected that this initiative, led jointly by Tusla and the Department of Justice and Equality, will begin shortly.  </p></reply>

Based on our own experience of EU membership, we believe it to be a transformative driver for stability, peace, and prosperity. </p><p>Both Montenegro and Serbia have been making steady progress in their negotiations with the EU and in implementing the reforms required to align with the <i>acquis</i>. Ireland would like to see these countries become EU members by 2025, dependent on them continuing to meet the obligations of membership. The Republic of North Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo all have further reforms to implement if they wish to upgrade their status. We share the EU&rsquo;s view that considerable work remains to be done before accession can occur. Conditionality cannot be compromised and all criteria must be met prior to accession. While we firmly support the European perspective of the six Western Balkan countries, Ireland has been clear that all benchmarks and criteria, particularly those relating to Chapters 23 and 24 of the acquis, which deal with issues relating to the rule of law, must be met before accession can be agreed.</p><p>We are also clear that the EU cannot import instability; the six Western Balkan states must resolve all outstanding bilateral issues before they can become members of the EU. The Prespa Agreement between the Republic of North Macedonia and Greece is a step in the right direction and shows that even the most fraught bilateral disputes can be resolved with committed leadership. </p><p>Providing the countries of the Western Balkans with a credible membership perspective is essential. We therefore believe it is important that the candidate and potential candidate countries are supported and rewarded as they make progress on their respective European paths. For this reason, we support increasing the funding available to the Instrument for Pre-Accession Funding (IPA) in the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework of the European Union. Ireland also gives annual funding to the Regional Cooperation Council, which supports regional cooperation and connectivity across the Western Balkans. In addition, officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassies accredited to the region are working to strengthen our already warm bilateral relations with the accession countries. To this end, Helen McEntee TD, Minister of State for European Affairs, visited Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia for various high-level meetings in February, while Andrew Doyle TD, Minister of State for Food, Forestry and Horticulture, visited Bosnia and Herzegovina for Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  We will continue to cultivate our bilateral relations and support the enlargement process within the institutions of the European Union. </p></reply>

Our attention is focused both on specific issues and events in Gaza and the West Bank, and the broader objective of a resolution of the conflict and an end to the Israeli occupation, something which is essential for the long term future of the Palestinian territory, and indeed also for Israel.</p>  <p>  At EU level, issues relating to the Israel-Palestine conflict are regularly discussed at both Ministerial and official level. The unacceptable situation in Gaza was specifically discussed at the May 2018 meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council. </p>  <p>  The same issues are also discussed regularly at UN level, at the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. At the most recent session of the Human Rights Council in March 2019, Ireland co-sponsored four draft resolutions pertaining to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which were adopted by vote.  </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support action on the ground by providing humanitarian assistance and working on specific projects to improve the situation of Palestinians, particularly in Gaza. In 2018, Ireland significantly increased our contribution to the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), by some &euro;3.5 million, bringing our total funding in 2018 to &euro;9 million. In 2019, our increased support to the Palestinian people will include the expansion of the programme of scholarships for Palestinian students, and the delivery of solar power in Gaza to help to alleviate the critical shortage of power.  </p>  <p>  The situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory will remain high on my agenda and I am committed to do everything I can to make a positive contribution to support credible efforts to resume negotiations and to advance the Middle East Peace Process. It is for this reason that I recently hosted a Foreign Ministers&rsquo; Retreat in February to discuss the present state of affairs. I will continue to press for strong EU engagement notwithstanding other problems in the region; on encouraging and seeking to influence the US initiative; and on exploring practical ideas to improve conditions on the ground, especially in Gaza. </p></reply>

The UN Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths, has played a leading role in bringing the internationally-recognised Government and the Houthi de facto authorities (also known as Ansar al Allah) to the negotiating table. In December 2018, agreements were reached by the parties in Stockholm, including on a fragile ceasefire in the key port city of Hodeidah and an agreement on prisoner exchange. </p>  <p>  To date, the UN Special Envoy has not indicated a need for international peacekeepers in Yemen.  </p>  <p>  However, following on from the December 2018 agreements, the UN Security Council established the UN Mission to Support the Hodeidah Agreement (UNMHA) in January 2019.  The Mission includes UN Monitors tasked with overseeing the ceasefire, redeployment of forces and mine action operations in Hodeidah.  A member of Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Defence Forces was seconded to UNMHA during its initial period. </p>  <p>  At this point, the international community focus is on sustaining political pressure on the parties to the conflict to implement the agreements reached in Stockholm. UNSE Griffiths has thanked the EU for its support thus far, saying it would not have been possible to reach agreement in Stockholm without it. During the February 2019 Foreign Affairs Council, Conclusions were adopted which commit the EU to continuing to engage with all parties to the conflict, as well as with regional actors, in order to support the UN-led process. </p>  <p>  It is also vitally important that the international community contributes to the humanitarian effort in Yemen. The UN plays an important role in delivering and coordinating humanitarian support in Yemen, in facilitating access for commercial goods, and in providing oversight through the work of the Human Rights Council and other human rights bodies. The EU also has a significant role to play in the delivery of aid and has committed over &euro;700 million to the Yemen crisis. Ireland has provided almost &euro;23 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since 2012.</p>  <p>  Ireland, the UN, the EU and the wider international community will continue to play an important role in attempting to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and facilitate a political solution for the people of Yemen. </p></reply>

A recent study by the ODI, a leading development think-tank, highlighted Ireland as the most effective international donor in directing resources to those in greatest need. </p>  <p>  Ireland works with a variety of partners in order to reach those in greatest humanitarian need around the world. We are committed to the multilateral system, and are one of the top ten donors to the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund - a global fund which ensures a rapid, coordinated response to the most significant global crises. We engage closely with the UN's Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance, and are currently chair of OCHA's Donor Support Group. </p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports the Red Cross Movement, and in 2018 concluded a three year MOU to provide core, unearmarked funding to the ICRC. This will allow the ICRC to conduct vital work in some of the most difficult and protracted crises around the world. </p>  <p>  Ireland also delivers humanitarian assistance through our NGO partners through the Humanitarian Programme Plan (HPP). Under this Plan, Ireland provides multi-annual funding to support partners&rsquo; responses in protracted and predictable crises.</p></reply>

This is particularly important in the context of Brexit.  Embassies also play a central role in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s trade objectives in markets with limited or no State Agency presence.</p>  <p>  In June 2018, the Government launched the Global Ireland initiative, which aims to double the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025. Global Ireland's targets include enhanced global engagement, the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy network and strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s State Agency presence overseas. Its aims include increasing Ireland&rsquo;s international visibility, facilitating market diversification and intensification, and enhancing bilateral relations in support of the Government&rsquo;s economic and political objectives, including in the context of Brexit.</p>  <p>  To date, the Government has approved funding for 13 new Embassies and Consulates, which are either already open, or set to open during 2019 or 2020.  We have already opened new Embassies in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Santiago and Amman, and new Consulates in Vancouver and Mumbai.  The Irish Aid office in Liberia has been upgraded to an Embassy.  New Consulates will open in Cardiff, Los Angeles and Frankfurt this year, followed by the opening of Embassies in Kyiv, Manila, and Rabat.  </p>  <p>  These locations have been chosen based on a range of factors, including their potential to diversify our markets, to grow trade and investment with Ireland, and to enable Irish companies to better take advantage of new opportunities.</p>  <p>  Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across the Embassy network continuously engage in economic and public diplomacy, to advance Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity and raise awareness of Ireland as a great place to live, study, work, visit and do business.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s officers overseas engage with host country Governments and multilateral institutions on a range of trade-related issues, including market access, regulatory compliance, visas, phyto-sanitary issues, and Double Taxation Agreements.</p>  <p>  The Embassy network also supports Irish businesses in market, by providing contacts and information, organising Ministerial visits overseas and supporting trade missions, in partnership with the state agencies.</p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and other State Agencies, both at home and overseas, to support Enterprise Ireland-led trade missions, and to ensure that firms based in Ireland are enabled to take advantage of new market opportunities. This approach is aligned with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s trade strategy Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World. </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department convenes four Joint Economic Commissions.  Through these formal inter-governmental fora the Department, along with other Departments and State Agencies, advances mutually beneficial initiatives with China, Russia, South Korea and Saudi Arabia.</p></reply>

In a recent presentation in relation to Climate Change and the Irish Financial System, the Central Bank of Ireland has noted that there has been a tripling of weather-related insurance events since the 1980s with annual average insurance payouts increasing from $10 billion to $55 billion. </p>  <p>  Primary responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate change rests with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Mr. Richard Bruton TD. Recently, the Government has given approval to Minister Bruton to develop an all of Government plan (the All of Government Plan on Climate Disruption) which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. Minister Bruton will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across a range sectors and my Department is likely to contribute to this exercise in relation to the issue of the availability and cost of property insurance cover.</p>  <p>  It is important that all parties to the UN Paris Climate Agreement, including Ireland, tackle climate change in line with their commitments. Meeting these targets is critical as part of the global effort to limit the extent of climate change. My officials have consulted with Insurance Ireland in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question and they share this view, highlighting the importance of mitigating the effects of climate change through public investment in improving infrastructural resilience, as weather events become more frequent and severe and more costly weather-related losses are being observed not just in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In relation to improving infrastructural resilience, the Deputy should note that the current core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding is the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management ("CFRAM") Programme. The CFRAM Programme focussed on 300 Areas for Further Assessment ("AFAs") including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding. The proposed feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, identified for AFAs are outlined in Flood Risk Management Plans. The Plans set out the flood relief schemes that have already been constructed and those that are currently underway. The Plans also provide the outline of 118 proposed schemes that can protect a further 11,500 properties and the evidence to prioritise their delivery to where its benefit is greatest. OPW have informed us that they and Local Authorities will work closely together on the all of the projects to ensure that they are all implemented in the lifetime of the Programme.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I believe the Government&rsquo;s extensive flood defence programme demonstrates its commitment to trying to minimise future flooding and thus ensuring that insurance  cover remains available at affordable prices. However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which has to be based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-16a.220.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041600060#WRE00700"><p>Supporting young farmers and generational renewal continues to be a priority for both the Government and the EU, and will form an important part of the CAP post-2020.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and his Department, are actively engaging with other Member States and the EU Commission on these issues during the current negotiations on the new CAP proposals.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that Commission Regulation (EU) No. 702/2014 of 25 June 2014, commonly known as the Agricultural Block Exemption Regulation (ABER), is the Regulation under which certain categories of State aid can be granted for the agricultural and forestry sectors.  </p>  <p>  Article 18 of the ABER sets out the specific requirements for the granting of aid for young farmers and the development of small farms.  It stipulates, inter alia, that the amount of aid per young farmer is to be limited to &euro;70,000.  This limit is a lifetime limit that applies to the cumulative aid received under all schemes covered by Article 18.  The relevant schemes are:</p>  <p>  - stock relief under section 667B Taxes Consolidation Act 1997;</p>  <p>  - farm succession partnerships under section 667D Taxes Consolidation Act 1997; and</p>  <p>  - transfers of land to young trained farmers under section 81AA Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.</p>  <p>  The ABER entered into force on 1 July 2014 and has had direct effect in all Member States since that date.  The Finance Act 2018 contained provisions in respect of this &euro;70,000 limit. This limit applies to claims for relief made in relation to stamp duty for transfers or conveyances of land executed on or after 1 January 2019, and for the year of assessment 2019 and subsequent years of assessment for stock relief and succession farm partnership relief.  Anyone submitting a stamp duty return for conveyances or transfers of land executed on or after 1 January 2019, or income tax returns for the 2019 year of assessment onwards, must have regard to the amount of relief claimed since 1 July 2014. The total amount claimed over the period must not exceed &euro;70,000.  </p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that the inheritance of a family farm does not attract a stamp duty charge and, thus, is not affected by the &euro;70,000 limit.  In addition, Revenue is currently revising its published guidance manual on the stamp duty element of the relief to confirm that, where a young trained farmer receives or buys farmland from certain relatives and is eligible for &lsquo;consanguinity relief&rsquo;, this relief can be applied before the &lsquo;young trained farmer&rsquo; relief on the transfer of the land.  As consanguinity relief operates by charging a reduced 1% rate of stamp duty (instead of the usual 6% rate on farmland), the amount of relief allowed (i.e. State aid granted) would be significantly reduced for many young trained farmers and ensure that they don&rsquo;t breach the &euro;70,000 ceiling.  The following example illustrates how this would apply: </p>  <p>  A young trained farmer gets a gift of farmland from his father in January 2019 which for stamp duty purposes is valued at &euro;1m. Consanguinity relief reduces the stamp duty liability from &euro;60,000 (6% rate) to &euro;10,000 (&euro;1m @ 1%). Young trained farmer relief will then reduce the stamp duty liability of &euro;10,000 to nil. &euro;10,000 is the amount of State aid claimed.</p>  <p>  Finally, any changes to the Regulation that gives rise to the lifetime cap can only be considered in the context of the CAP negotiations. In the meantime, the Government must seek to ensure, as with all EU Regulations, that the Regulation is enforced here, or we risk being in contravention of EU law.</p></reply>

The last time that the betting duty rate was increased was in 1975 and at 1% betting duty was at an all time low.   </p>  <p>  Receipts from betting duty represented less than 1 per cent of all excise receipts in 2018 as in previous years. In addition, unlike other excisable commodities, there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. I have outlined why I consider the betting sector needs to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In any discussion on betting duty, we must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately being borne by taxpayers. I have outlined my view that this needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.   </p>  <p>  In the course of last year's Finance Bill process, I acknowledged that small independent bookmakers may have difficulty competing with larger bookmakers with retail and/or online operations. At the time I agreed to review an alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector. My officials are currently considering this proposal, including the compatibility of a core element with EU rules, and will set out analysis and options in relation to betting duty at the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) meeting in July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards. </p>  <p>  Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters in their pricing decisions. Betting duty will be given further consideration in the next budget and in that context my decision will be informed by the outcome of the review into the alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector as well as the other considerations which I have set out.</p></reply>

The relief allows owner-occupiers to retain the proceeds made from liquidating the equity in their home, without being liable to CGT. Downsizers can use the proceeds from the sale of this property to purchase more appropriate accommodation.</p>  <p>  Downsizers are &lsquo;Second and Subsequent Buyers&rsquo; (SSBs) under the Central Bank&rsquo;s macro-prudential mortgage measures. As such, the same rules that apply to all SSBs also apply to downsizers. Specifically, a generalised Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 80 per cent and Loan-to-Income (LTI) of 3.5 times income is applicable.</p>  <p>  In the case of downsizers, the required equity stake for access to an SSB mortgage is likely to be significantly more attainable than would be the case for First Time Buyers (FTBs), or other purchasers. The new accommodation is likely to be purchased at a price below the sales price of the existing dwelling, obviating the need for significant savings as would be the case with FTBs.</p>  <p>  The most effective way to support downsizers is to increase the supply of housing and, in particular, smaller units such as apartments. In that respect, recent indicators are very positive. The number of apartment completions doubled between 2016 and 2018, from 1,169 to 2,372. Similarly, planning permissions granted for apartments increased by 137 per cent over the same period and accounted for 46 per cent of all planning permissions in 2018.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to support increased supply of all types of housing.</p></reply>

In addition, unlike other excisable commodities, there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. I have outlined why I consider the betting sector needs to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In any discussion on betting duty, we must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately being borne by taxpayers. I have outlined my view that this needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.   </p>  <p>  In the course of last year's Finance Bill process, I acknowledged that small independent bookmakers may have difficulty competing with larger bookmakers with retail and/or online operations. At the time I agreed to review an alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector. My officials are currently considering this proposal, including the compatibility of a core element with EU rules, and will set out analysis and options in relation to betting duty at the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) meeting in July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards. </p>  <p>  Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters in their pricing decisions. Betting duty will be given further consideration in the next budget and in that context my decision will be informed by the outcome of the review into the alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector as well as the other considerations which I have set out.</p></reply>

IGEES is not a standalone service. IGEES staff are an integral part of each Department, adding their skill set to the varied expertise working on policy analysis and formulation as directed by Departmental business plans.  </p>  <p>  The number of IGEES staff increased from approximately 30 in 2012 to 160 in 2018. The majority of IGEES staff are employed at Administrative Officer (AO) grade. From 2012 to 2016, costs were almost entirely related to pay - for each Department&rsquo;s existing and newly recruited analysts - and formed part of each Department&rsquo;s overall pay allocation as presented in the Revised Estimates Volume. </p>  <p>  In 2017, an IGEES budget line was established to support the implementation of the IGEES Medium Term Strategy 2016-19. Total expenditure for the IGEES programme line in 2017 and 2018 was &euro;178,111 and &euro;156,491 respectively, while the allocation in 2019 is &euro;350,000. The IGEES programme line supports the delivery of:</p>  <p>  - IGEES Learning and Development Framework (accounted for just under 50% of expenditure for the period 2016-17 and delivered a wide range of training courses such as cost-benefit analysis, statistical programming, counterfactual impact evaluation etc.)</p>  <p>  - IGEES Research Fund, which supports cross-Departmental research projects (accounted for 30% of expenditure for the period 2016-17 and co-funded two projects on housing conducted collaboratively by the Department of Housing and Department of Finance, which involved commissioning of the survey field work)  </p>  <p>  - Civil Service analytical capacity building through IGEES recruitment and IGEES internship</p>  <p>  - IGEES events including conferences and seminars. </p>  <p>  To date, IGEES analysts produced and published over 200 policy analysis papers across all policy areas, strengthening significantly the evidence base for policy formulation in Ireland. The papers were produced by IGEES staff, not by commissioned consultancies. IGEES resources support the on-going work of Government Departments in relation to policy analysis, evaluation and economic appraisal. </p>  <p>  IGEES is currently working on a new Medium Term Strategy 2020 -2023.  As part of this work, the OECD is carrying out a review of IGEES.  The results of the review, expected in Quarter 3 of this year, will inform the development of the new IGEES Medium Term Strategy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-16a.268.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041600060#WRE05700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 154 together.</p><p>My Department is committed to supporting initiatives that increase and promote the employment of persons with disabilities. The percentage of employees with disabilities in my Department in 2017 was 3.4%, as recorded in the Report on Compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 for 2017 published by National Disability Authority.</p><p>A 2018 figure of 4.25% for my Department has been returned to the central Monitoring Committee.  However, the 2018 report has not yet been published.  A disability census is carried out within my Department on an annual basis which allows for anonymity. It does not ask staff to specify if the nature of any disability details submitted pertains to physical, intellectual or mental health conditions and as such an overall figure is recorded.  The 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in my Department will rise to 4% in 2019, 5% in 2021 and 6% in 2024.</p><p>A collaboration between AHEAD and the Civil Service on the Willing and Able Mentoring Programme (WAM) has been in place for over 12 years, in which 170 graduates have gained valuable work experience. In turn, the Civil Service has gained much from the graduates contribution to and participation in our workforce.</p><p>The central Monitoring Committee in my Department monitors the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in public bodies staffed by civil servants. Public bodies under the aegis of Government Departments where the majority of staff are not civil servants have a separate Monitoring Committee that will report directly to the National Disability Authority. </p><p>Finally, I am advised that the position regarding the bodies under the aegis of my Department is as follows.</p><p><b>Office of Public Works</b></p><p>The Office of Public Works employs a number of staff members who have chosen to self-disclose a disability.  The precise nature of their disability is not required to be disclosed and therefore the number of OPW employees with intellectual disabilities, as distinct from other types of disability, is unknown.  Overall survey figures show that 3.5% of civil servants in the Office of Public Works have a disability. The OPW intends to carry out a comprehensive disability census across its whole workforce in 2019, with a view to establishing a new baseline figure which will inform its plans to reach the 6% target of employees with disability by 2024.  It is envisaged that these plans will include the identification of roles within the OPW that may be suitable to targeted recruitment campaigns for people with intellectual disabilities.</p><p><b>National Shared Service Office</b></p><p>The number of employees declaring a disability is monitored regularly within the NSSO.  However, the disability type is not recorded and therefore the NSSO cannot provide the number of employees with an intellectual disability. The overall figure for staff with a disability for 2017 was 4.22%. The up to date figure is currently being collated and will be available shortly.  The NSSO will continue to be an equal opportunities employer ensuring diversity in the workforce.</p><p><b>Public Appointments Service</b></p><p>The number of PAS employees declaring an intellectual disability is not regularly monitored.  In the last census, 4.12% of staff self-declared a disability.  PAS remains an equal opportunities employer pursuing diversity in the workforce.</p><p><b>State Lab</b></p><p>The number of employees declaring an intellectual disability is not regularly monitored. Currently the percentage of employees with a non-specified disability is 4.2%. The State Lab remains an equal opportunities employer pursuing diversity in the workforce.</p><p><b>Office of the Ombudsman</b></p><p>The Office of the Ombudsman do not collect data on the type of disability a member of staff may have. The office currently has 10 staff members (7.6%) which have anonymously disclosed that they have a disability, with 1 person disclosing an intellectual disability. This annual anonymous staff census survey is carried out by the Disability Liaison Officer. The Office of the Ombudsman participates in the WAM programme and have in place an Access Office and had a Diversity and Equality Officer appointed in 2018.</p><p><b>National Lottery Regulator</b></p><p>The National Lottery Regulator Code of Business Conduct prohibits discrimination of any kind against people with disabilities, regardless of the nature of the disability. This applies to the process of the recruitment and appointment of new staff and to the retention of staff who may have acquired a disability. The induction policy specifically sets out the procedure to be taken into consideration on the appointment of new staff with a disability and additional supports that may be required to assist into the organisation. The office has a complement of 10 staff and the functions of the office require very specific skillsets and all posts require the post holder to have associated skills and expertise. All vacancies are filled via open competition and recruitment is based on ability to meet the requirements of the post. All applicants, whether with or without a disability, are engaged on that basis. Currently, there is no record of any staff member with an intellectual disability.</p></reply>

This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p><p>The Forum met in the period subsequent to the conduct of this scoping exercise where relevant matters in respect of this issue were discussed in comprehensive detail with the members of the Forum.  These discussions provided a clear understanding to each of the parties of their respective  positions in relation to this matter and in this context the formal engagement process between the parties was accordingly  concluded on this basis.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that in my answer to her previous question No. 67 of 18 October I informed her that the NEPS Galway office was supporting vacancies in its educational psychologist staffing complement.  I can now inform her that these vacancies have now been filled, the first in January 2019 and the second as recently as last week.</p>  <p>  These staff are undergoing normal induction process and work-shadowing within that office and are being and will be allocated full lists of schools as the year progresses.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, however, a Senior Psychologist in that office took retirement producing another vacancy which will be filled following an internal NEPS competition to be organised shortly.</p>  <p>  Furthermore I am pleased to inform the Deputy that an additional psychologist post is being provided to the Galway office to enhance school coverage in the immediate catchment area.  The Public Appointments Service is currently processing a candidate for recruitment in this regard.  It is envisaged that my Department will be in a position to make this appointment in the near future.</p>  <p>  In the interim schools affected in relation to the aforementioned vacancies will continue to have service provided as described above, with pupil assessment needs being provided by private practitioners through the SCPA scheme.</p></reply>

SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0010/2013. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum. It must also be clear that the existing IT equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs. </p>  <p>  My Department is unable to provide funding for assistive technology for pupils that are not attending a recognised school. </p>  <p>  The Department's preferred approach is that, where possible, children are educated in school settings where they may have access to individualised education programmes, fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  </p>  <p>  Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 parents are responsible for making sure their child receives an education.  Under this legislation, every child between the ages of 6 and 16 must attend school or otherwise receive an education.  Most children attend recognised schools although some are educated at home or in non-recognised schools. If a parent decides to educate their child outside of a recognised school, for example in the home, they must register the child with the Child and Family Agency; further information is available on www.tusla.ie in this regard. This requirement exists in order to support parents in their right to home educate and to safeguard a child&rsquo;s right to a minimum education, as provided for in the constitution.</p></reply>

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes which can be supported by Special Needs Assistants and fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) as well as the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils. </p>  <p>  The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions may be particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use.</p>  <p>  However, my Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used. While ABA may help to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as a number of those, to which I have referred, are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.</p>  <p>  All recognised schools must operate in line with this policy. This policy has been informed by published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001), the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (2006) and the NCSE&rsquo;s policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016). </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-16a.424.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019041600063#WRH05300"><p>The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (&ldquo;the Convention&rdquo;) is one of sustained and ongoing improvement. Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities. It provides a mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD; and the NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, will have an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group is committed to carrying out a mid-term review of the Strategy by the end of 2019 and in the context of this review  it is expected that it will examine how the Strategy is aligned with the articles of the Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention. The National Disability Authority (NDA) will also play a critical part in the implementation of the Convention, and will be carrying out a review of progress with respect to the Strategy&rsquo;s key indicators in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE have responsibility for a significant number of actions under the Strategy. The HSE National Service Plan 2019, which was published earlier this year, is focused on providing supports to people with disabilities and enabling them to maximise their full potential as independently as possible. Measures in the Service Plan will also reduce the waiting times for Assessments of Need for children through the provision of 100 additional therapist posts. Including the additional funding I secured for use in the Service Plan, this brings the total investment in the provision of disability services to almost &euro;1.9bn in 2019. </p>  <p>  Article 19 of the Convention deals with living independently and being included in the community.  It provides that persons with disabilities should have access to a range of in-home, residential and other community support services.  In the 2019 Service Plan, the HSE will provide 1.53m personal assistant hours to 2,535 people, and 3.08m home support hours for 8,094 people.</p>  <p>  To meet obligations under Article 12, and Article 7, addressing rights for children with disabilities, additional funding of &euro;12m has been allocated to meet the cost of providing day supports and services for approximately 1,500 young adults who will leave school in 2019. Under the plan, the HSE will move up to 160 people from large institutional settings to homes in the community. Ninety new high-acuity emergency residential places will also be funded in 2019 to address urgent unplanned cases as they arise.</p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to Article 12 of the Convention is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  </p>  <p>   New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced. The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  In addition to the practical measures outlined above, there are a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, my colleague the Minister for Health is progressing heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty. A report of a recent public consultation on these draft legislative provisions is nearing completion, and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published on December 2016. Second Stage (D&aacute;il) took place on 31 January and 1 February 2017, and Committee Stage on 30 January 2019.</p>  <p>  The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.</p>  <p>  The monitoring framework will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority (NDA) and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. The IHREC Act 2014 was designed to ensure that IHREC, as Ireland&rsquo;s National Human Rights Institution, fully meets the standard of independence in accordance with the Paris Principles.</p>  <p>  The IHREC established a Disability Advisory Committee in January 2019, composed of a diverse group of persons with lived experience of disability. This will ensure the direct participation of persons with disabilities and the organisations representing them in monitoring how the Convention is implemented in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Addressing the needs and rights of people living with a disability and their families is a priority for this Government and my primary focus as Minister of State for Disability Issues. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities supports that priority in providing a comprehensive and robust framework for the realisation of rights. </p></reply>

As part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's engagement with the Policing Authority, monthly reports are published online which include updates in relation to modernisation and renewal, including ICT projects. The February 2019 report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Policing Authority provides the following update:</p><p>&quot;After the successful completion of the Mobility Pilot in Limerick, a full review of the system configuration is currently in progress. The development of new functionality for checking NCT status of vehicles is now in the test phase.&quot;</p><p>The March 2019 report indicates that an upgrade was successfully completed to assist in front-line mobility. These reports are available to download via: and .</p><p>Penalties for driving while disqualified and for non-return of a driving licence are contained in Road Traffic legislation, which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Minister Shane Ross, T.D. As regards the relinquishing of a driving licence on foot of a disqualification, Part 9 of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 537 of 2006), as amended, contains regulations relating to drivers who are subject to a consequential, ancillary or special disqualification. </p><p>It is acknowledged that there is a cohort of drivers that do not comply with the aforementioned legal requirements and do not surrender their licences on foot of a disqualification.  That being the case, the rate of licence non-return does not necessarily equate with the rate of driving while disqualified. For example, a person who has not surrendered their physical licence  might no longer drive, whereas another person who has complied with the aforementioned regulations by returning their licence, might, in fact, continue to drive without a licence. </p><p>Enforcement is crucial and the roll-out of the Garda mobility strategy will facilitate more effective road traffic enforcement via front-line access to real time information, including in relation to disqualified drivers. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24/7 basis.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the key importance of ICT and digital innovation was also emphasised in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and a number of related actions are included in the Implementation Plan for that report - 'A Policing Service for the Future'. </p></reply>

This is a normal and established feature of international relations between states.</p><p>Decisions in relation to the grant of certificates to official foreign security personnel are made following consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner and I am assured by him that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they have the opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required and are properly supported and supervised, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with the responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to allow the deployment of increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the Cohort model of resource allocation is currently utilised for the general allocation of personnel within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College. The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel, using the Cohort Model, is determined by a number of factors, including, crime and non-crime workload; minimum establishment; population; area; policing arrangements; operational strategies and transfer applications, including welfare issues. When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is conducted with Local Management during which all factors are taken into consideration. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy as provided by the Garda Commissioner is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link.</p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and a net 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>On-going recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions.  </p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the link: </p></reply>

The cost of training</p>  <p>  2. The need for recruits to serve for a sufficient period of time as full members of the service to recoup this cost.</p>  <p>  3. The operational requirements of the service in terms of having an age profile appropriate to the physical demands placed on members in the course of their duty.</p>  <p>  The report of the Garda Inspectorate, and the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, both published in 2018, have highlighted certain issues in relation to recruitment strategies for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the maximum age of recruitment.  </p>  <p>  In response to these reports, the question of the appropriate age for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be considered as part of a review of entry to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being undertaken by the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, this review has not yet concluded.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the case to which you refer in your correspondence, the decision made by the CJEU was that the WRC has jurisdiction to hear a case of discrimination on age grounds and therefore the power to disapply a rule of national law that is found to be contrary to EU Law. No decision in relation to the entry age requirement for Garda members was made by the CJEU. Instead the case is being referred back to the WRC to be heard.  Therefore, the current position of a maximum recruitment age of not more than 35 years remains in place.</p></reply>

Investment of &euro;46 million is also being made in the Garda fleet over the same period to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Further, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of his identified operational demands. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Garda Air Support Unit was established in September 1997 with the delivery of a Pilatus Britten-Norman BN 2T-4S Defender 4000 fixed wing aircraft and a Eurocopter AS355N Eceuriel helicopter. In 2001 the Unit acquired a second helicopter - a Eurocopter EC 135 T2. In 2007 the Eceuriel helicopter was replaced by a second EC135 T2+. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the question of prioritising the upgrading or replacement of these aircraft is in the first instance for the Commissioner, in the context of the investment being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and his operational priorities.  </p>  <p>  I understand from the Garda authorities that neither the two helicopters nor the Fixed Wing Aircraft have reached the end of their operational lives and as such, no funding has been provided in the 2019 budget for the replacement of these aircraft.  Regarding the future replacement of the fixed wing aircraft, I can confirm that a Technical Advisory Group comprising of personnel from my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Defence and the Irish Air Corps was established and met for the first time in 2016 to examine the options in that regard.  </p>  <p>  Regarding equipment on these aircraft, I can inform the Deputy that funding is available to upgrade the Role Equipment on the Eurocopter EC135 T2+. I am informed by the Garda authorities that a tendering process for this upgrade will commence this year.  I am further informed that it is intended that the Role Equipment currently on this aircraft will subsequently be installed into the Eurocopter 135 T2 Helicopter.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with Garda management on an ongoing basis in relation to current and capital resource needs.</p></reply>

This report is submitted to the National Disability Authority (NDA).  </p><p>I can inform the Deputy that the proportion of staff with a disability employed in my Department was 5.9% in 2018, which exceeds the Government's 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities.  I have asked those offices and agencies under the aegis of my Department whose staff are not Department employees to respond directly to the Deputy with their most up to date information.</p><p>I would also note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service (prison officers) are exempt under the reporting provisions of the Act. </p><p>My Department does not have data regarding the number of staff with an intellectual disability.  The distinction between a physical and intellectual disability is not captured when staff report a disability. </p><p>My Department is fully committed to the employment of people with disabilities.  Our policy is to ensure that people with disabilities are facilitated with access to employment opportunities and every necessary accommodation is made in this regard.<b></b>My Department's commitment to the employment of people with disabilities is further underlined by its active participation in the Willing Able Mentoring Programme, a work experience programme for graduates with disabilities, under which there are currently 2 placements and we are seeking to facilitate a further 2 participants in 2019. </p><p>On a broader level, the Government's Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) for Persons with Disabilities 2015 - 2024  sets out a ten-year cross-Government approach to ensuring that people with disabilities who are able to, and want to work are supported and enabled to do so, with different Departments and State agencies acting in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities.</p><p>One of the key priorities of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy is to increase the statutory target of persons with disabilities employed in our public services from 3% to 6% on a phased basis by January 2024.  To give effect to this commitment, legislative proposals are currently being progressed through the Oireachtas as part of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016.</p></reply>

At the time I responded that I would request the information sought by you from an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that I would write directly to you on receipt of same. I did so at the end of last week. The substance of that response is now repeated below.</p>  <p>  As you will appreciate, it is solely the Garda Commissioner and his management team who are responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p>  <p>  A Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fully committed to fulfilling the organisation&rsquo;s obligations under the Official Languages Act and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p>  <p>  Section 33 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 provides that the Commissioner shall determine the manner in which members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are to be distributed and stationed throughout the State. In carrying out this function the section further provides that the Commissioner shall to the extent practicable ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stationed in a District that includes a Gaeltacht area are sufficiently competent in the Irish language to enable them to use it in carrying out their duties.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Commissioner seeks to meet this obligation by providing for a specialist Irish language stream in recruitment campaigns. I was pleased to note that the current Garda Recruitment Competition, which closes on Wednesday 24 April 2019, has a special Irish Language stream whereby eligible applicants who are fluent Irish speakers may opt to be considered for inclusion in a specialist Irish language stream within the overall recruitment competition run by the Public Appointments Service. Candidates appointed from the Irish Language stream are expected to provide a full range of services in Irish and are allocated to Gaeltacht areas for a period of time as determined by the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  In addition all new recruits complete a Bachelor of Arts in Policing Studies which includes Irish language modules and ensures that trainees have the opportunity to improve their level of proficiency in the language.</p>  <p>  I am advised that a Garda HQ Directive issued in September 2018 under which Sergeants and Garda&iacute; interested in transferring to a Gaeltacht Garda Station must now pass an Oral Irish Proficiency Assessment so as to ensure that only members of these ranks that are fluent in Irish are permitted to serve in Gaeltacht stations. The Office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga has viewed the new system and is satisfied that is an appropriate system for the organisation to determine a member&rsquo;s ability to serve in a Gaeltacht station. When the new system of assessment is fully implemented it is expected that a panel will be formed from which members will be assigned to Gaeltacht Garda Stations as required.</p></reply>

This is a fundamental exercise of State sovereignty necessary to protect the security of the State and to prevent illegal immigration.</p>  <p>  The exercise of powers in this area is subject to the law and respect for individual rights. </p>  <p>  I would point out that detention of a person refused entry to the State is undertaken as a last resort. Indeed, there is a statutory obligation to return a person refused entry permission as soon as is practicable. Most persons are returned on the same day that they are refused entry.</p>  <p>  Detention and removal of persons refused permission to enter the State are essentially operational matters for the Garda National Immigration Bureau who work closely with civilian immigration officers on these matters.</p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 2003 (as amended by the International protection Act, 2015), contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused permission to enter. It specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable. It also provides that a person may be detained for a period not exceeding 12 hours at the airport or port from which the person is due to depart. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with the Office of Public Works are undertaking a project at Dublin Airport to refurbish and fit-out an existing facility to provide a Garda Station, office accommodation and detention facilities.</p>  <p>  The refurbishment works at the new Garda Station and Immigration facility at Dublin Airport has reached substantial completion stage and the facility is scheduled to be handed over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shortly, following the internal fit out of the building, furniture, installation of PCs and phones, etc. It is anticipated that the facility will become operational in May 2019.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles among the various Garda divisions.  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters. I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that given this very significant level of investment and the overall number of vehicles available in the Garda fleet, the requirement for hire of vehicles is occasional only.  I am informed, for example, that this might arise where a non-standard type of vehicle may be required for specific operational purposes, or to meet a short term demand for transport.  I am further informed that on occasion, an unmarked hired vehicle may be required to support detective or surveillance duties or where there may be a delay between the decommissioning of an unmarked Garda vehicle and the availability of a replacement.  I am informed that no vehicles are hired for the marked Garda fleet. </p><p>I am further informed that as all Garda members are issued with Tetra radios, the hiring of vehicles does not impact on operational effectiveness.</p><p>The following table sets out the information as provided by the Garda authorities on the amount spent by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the rental of unmarked vehicles in each of the years from 2011 to 2018 and to date in 2019 (correct to 10 April, 2019).<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro; 59,287.77</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro; 18,058.98</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro; 43,151.94</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro; 27,216.81</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro; 23,056.56</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro; 18,187.86</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro; 48,399.15</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro; 112,291.90</td></tr><tr><td>2019* (to 10 April 2019)</td><td>&euro; 40,743.94</td></tr></table><b></b></p><p>The Deputy also requested information on the number of vehicles hired in 2019.

No. 569 of 2011).  </p>  <p>  The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil. It would appear that this applicant would be applying as a standard adult applicant or as the spouse of an Irish national. In neither scenario will the application and certification fee combined amount to more than &euro;1,125.</p>  <p>  As such, the Regulations make specific provision for particular categories of applicants who may be on a reduced level of income and there is no information available to either myself or Departmental officials that in general, the level of fees is discouraging people from applying for naturalisation.  </p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Regulations for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees, or for differing fees to apply to different nationalities, or based on length of residency.     </p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants. These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation, along with the relevant application forms and guidance notes, is available on the INIS website at ww.inis.gov.ie.</p></reply>

There are also 38 Garda Reserves and 88 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cork City Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>The Garda strength of Cork City Division from 2009 to 28 February 2019 as provided by the Garda Commissioner is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link.</p><p>Garda_Numbers_by_Division_District_and_Station_2009_to_February_2019.xlsx</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,600 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 69 were assigned to the Cork City Division.</p><p>The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and a net 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019.</p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible effective and responsive policing service to communities across all Garda Divisions including the Cork City Division.</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link.</p><p>.</p></reply>

The Lisbon Treaty extended this competence to cover foreign direct investment, as well as making the European Parliament a co-legislator alongside the Council on trade matters.  </p>  <p>  Under this architecture the European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries regarding trade agreements with non-EU countries. Member States (in Council) approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are consulted as the negotiations proceed and have final approval at Council as has the European Parliament.  In addition, the EU Commission represents Ireland and other EU Member States at the WTO, taking into account the needs of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.  </p>  <p>  The current international trade environment has seen a rise of protectionism, which is an unwelcome development for Ireland, given our open and globalised economy and has the potential to harm market sentiment and disrupt global supply chains should the situation escalate.  </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU are strong supporters of multilateral approaches to solving a range of global challenges.  In that context, we see the WTO as the forum by which the international community can successfully promote economic development and free trade in support of good jobs for our people. Importantly, it provides a bulwark against damaging trade disputes and remains as relevant today as it was at its inception in 1995, albeit reforms to meet the challenges of the 21st Century are required as some Countries have identified.  In this regard, Ireland is strongly supportive of the EU Commission&rsquo;s very active role in the WTO reform discussions, including the tabling of specific proposals for reform of the operations and "rulebook" of the WTO, as well as engaging in the important trilateral co-operation with the US and Japan as well as the &ldquo;Ottawa&rdquo; process led by Canada.  </p>  <p>  Key to dependable rules-based trade for Irish and EU businesses is the EU&rsquo;s suite of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), which has evolved over time, from the &lsquo;First Generation&rsquo; FTAs dating back to the 1970s which focused on tariffs for goods, to the current &lsquo;New Generation&rsquo; of FTAs which go beyond the reduction or elimination of conventional tariff barriers to include; non-tariff and regulatory barriers, services, investment, recognition of professional qualifications, intellectual property rights, access to public procurement, regulatory cooperation, sustainable development, labour and environment.  These help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish based firms.</p>  <p>  One of the most important aspects of the EU's trade policy is that - alongside protecting European businesses and consumers - it is promoting the EU's principles and values.  Furthermore, each Agreement includes arrangements for joint committee oversight which promotes dialogue as a means of settling any potential trade dispute or differences in interpretation, that may arise under the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The benefits of the establishment of comprehensive EU Free Trade Agreements with third countries must not only be counted in terms of the economic benefits, but also the establishment of strong lines of communication and areas of common interest with other economies.  These ties encourage both the EU and its trade partners to adopt a unified, diplomatic, approach to any respective areas of concern that may arise within a mutually respectful environment, as valued, respected and equal trade partners.</p></reply>

All Vouchers (Standard and Fast Track) are valid for 12 months. However, voucher time lines can be extended once Enterprise Ireland is satisfied that the R&amp;D project is underway with a registered knowledge provider before the expiry date of the voucher. Only one extension is generally permitted with a maximum extension limit of 6 months. The pace of industrial change is fast and a company may change direction, or the market demands a change in the company direction, with regards to its R&amp;D.  Delays in voucher redemption can result if a company is not able to identify a Knowledge Provider that can carry out the project i.e. it is not always possible to have a perfect balance between the skills and expertise of the knowledge provider and the company&rsquo;s requirements.</p>  <p>  I have been informed that the Innovation Vouchers Programme has recently been independently evaluated by an external consultant and the results are extremely positive.  The economic impact alone has increased since the last evaluation carried out in 2014.  To end 2018, the Innovation Voucher Programme has an Economic Value Add impact of &euro;4.72 per &euro;1.00 of Enterprise Ireland investment.  </p>  <p>  I understand that almost all respondents to the evaluation (82%) would be willing to participate in an Innovation Voucher project in the future or recommend the Programme to other businesses (97%).  This is a very positive reflection on company experiences of the Programme.  Some aspects that companies liked about the programme was that it is flexible, simple and easy to apply for and it motivates them to engage in R&amp;D, de-risking their investment and providing validation and testing of ideas.</p></reply>

This investigation concluded that there was no systemic wrongdoing in the work of the Labour Inspectorate.  This conclusion was accepted by the Department and the outcome was communicated to the individual in April 2016.  The individual was offered the opportunity of a review of this decision and this offer was not taken up within the timeframe provided.</p>  <p>  The individual subsequently sought on a number of occasions to have the matter re-investigated, by my predecessors, who were satisfied that appropriate and due process had been followed in responding to the individual&rsquo;s original disclosure.</p>  <p>  As also outlined in the article in the Village magazine, since the individual&rsquo;s initial disclosure, my Department has, and continues to be, engaged in responding to a number of claims of penalisation and unfair dismissal brought by the individual to the independent Adjudication Services of the WRC and on appeal to the Labour Court.  These are the appropriate statutory fora for dealing with such claims.  As some of these proceedings continue to be active cases, it would not be appropriate to comment further on these, other than to assure you that my Department will continue to engage with these fora. </p>  <p>  Under its establishing legislation, the WRC is independent of the Minister and the Department in the performance of its functions. The policy for the WRC as agreed by the Oireachtas, is set out in the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  In that regard, the WRC correctly operates a compliance approach to employment law.  This approach has worked very well to date, as demonstrated by the data.  Prosecutions are taken only where the compliance route has not worked.  </p>  <p>  The Inspectorate Division of NERA and more recently the WRC have played an extremely important role in securing employment rights for employees and ensuring that compliant employers are not put at a disadvantage. When finding that an employer is not compliant with legislation (for example, inadequate records, improperly calculating hours worked or holiday entitlements) the approach of the Inspectorate is to bring that employer to compliance by pointing out the breach(s) and affording them a specific time in which to rectify them. Occasionally the Inspector may issue &ldquo;Compliance Notices&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fixed Payment Notices&rdquo; in this regard. The success of this approach is such that prosecution is required in less than 10% of cases where employers are found to be in breach (i.e. 5% of all inspections). Last year, the WRC completed almost 5,800 inspections &ndash; an increase of 20% on 2017 &ndash; and recovered &euro;3.1m in unpaid wages for employees.</p></reply>

Part 5 of the Act sets out the following obligations on Government Departments and public service bodies regarding the employment of people with disabilities:</p><p>- Public bodies must, insofar as practicable, take all reasonable measures to promote and support their employment of people with disabilities.</p><p>- Public bodies shall ensure, unless there are good reasons for not doing so, that at least 3% of their employees are people with disabilities.</p><p>- Public bodies must report on an annual basis to a statutory monitoring committee in their parent Department on the number of people with disabilities in their employment and the measures they are taking to promote and support their employment.  The monitoring committees in turn submit their reports on such compliance to the Minister of their parent Department and the National Disability Authority (NDA).</p><p>To build an accurate record of the number of staff with disabilities, in accordance with the legal definition in the 2005 Act, every employee, whether or not they have any impairment or disability, is asked to complete a census form and return it, in confidence, to a nominated person. While public bodies have a statutory obligation to report, there is no obligation on employees to disclose if they have a disability or the nature of the disability. If any employee seeks a reasonable accommodation, the nature of their disability may be disclosed for the purpose of availing of an accommodation. While my Department records the number of employees with a disability in order to comply with Part 5, of it does not record intellectual disabilities separately.</p><p>Under the 2005 Act, public bodies staffed by civil servants report via the Monitoring Committee in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, while all other public bodies report via the Monitoring Committee in their parent Departments. Public bodies must report to their Monitoring Committees by 31 March each year. Monitoring Committees must then report to their respective Ministers and the National Disability Authority by the 30 June. As such, the latest figures available in respect of my Department and the bodies within its remit are for 2017, as listed in the following table. <table><tr><th>Name of Body</th><th>Total Employees 2017</th><th>No of employees with a disability 2017</th><th>% of employees with a disability 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation</td><td>871 </td><td>45 </td><td>5.17% </td></tr><tr><td>Competition and Consumer Protection Commission</td><td>91 </td><td>6 </td><td>6.59% </td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland</td><td>632 </td><td>26 </td><td>4.11% </td></tr><tr><td>Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority</td><td>170 </td><td>6 </td><td>3.53% </td></tr><tr><td>IDA Ireland</td><td>335 </td><td>13 </td><td>3.88% </td></tr><tr><td>InterTrade Ireland</td><td>44 </td><td>2 </td><td>4.55% </td></tr><tr><td>National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)</td><td>137 </td><td>6 </td><td>4.38% </td></tr><tr><td>Personal Injuries Assessment Board</td><td>83 </td><td>1 </td><td>1.20% </td></tr><tr><td>Science Foundation Ireland</td><td>58 </td><td>2 </td><td>3.45% </td></tr></table></p><p>In 2018 my Department established a Disability Consultative Committee, whose agenda for 2019 includes issues around disability awareness training and reviewing actions under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-21. The National Disability Inclusion Strategy is committed to increasing the public sector employment target of persons with disabilities from 3% to 6% by 2024, and embeds this target into all public service workforce planning and recruitment.</p><p>In addition, my Department has participated in the WAM (Willing Able Mentoring) project led by AHEAD (the Association for Higher Education Access and Disabilities) and in Job Shadow Day, an initiative led by the Irish Association of Supported Employment. Both of these initiatives provide the opportunity for people with disabilities to gain experience in different workplaces through coaching, mentoring and job shadowing, as well as building the capacity of employers to integrate disability into the workplace.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s agencies are also active in this area:</p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), a key agency of my Department is supporting a range of researchers working in diverse areas related to the field including quantum thermodynamics and quantum photonics.  There is also investment across a broad range of underpinning technologies right across our higher education system.  This research is often being co-funded by industry with companies and academics working together on specific projects.  SFI is currently drafting an ambitious new strategy for the period 2020-2025.  The strategy will include further mechanisms to support more future looking technologies like quantum technology. </p>  <p>  In late 2018, SFI and University College Cork (UCC) also successfully recruited Professor Seamus Davis, one of the world&rsquo;s leading quantum physicists to Ireland from the US under the SFI Research Professorship Programme to boost our academic capabilities in this area.  This leading academic has taken up a joint position at University College Cork and the University of Oxford.  The nature of his joint appointment will encourage knowledge flow and student mobility between the UK and Ireland at a time such channels for collaboration and partnership in research need to be embraced.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides core funding to support the day-to-day operations of the Tyndall National Institute.  Based in Cork, Tyndall is a leading European research centre in integrated ICT hardware and systems. Tyndall has been pioneering Irish efforts in the quantum field, specifically on the actual realisation of Quantum Technologies. Quantum cryptography for secure communications and sources of quantum light for quantum information (quantum internet and quantum computation) have been important areas progressed by the Institute. Tyndall&rsquo;s research teams have been investing in quantum materials and quantum-effect devices for over 15 years.  </p>  <p>  SFI and Tyndall are also partners on the QuantERA in Quantum Technologies.  QuantERA is a network of 32 organisations from 26 countries, coordinated by the National Science Centre, Poland, supporting international research projects in the field of Quantum Technologies.  </p>  <p>  In late 2018 Ireland became a founding member of the new European High-Performance Computing (EuroHPC) Joint Undertaking. EuroHPC seeks to invest in High Performance Computing infrastructure, applications, research and skills with a goal of developing a world class High Performance Computing capability in Europe.  Its longer-term aims include support for the first hybrid HPC / Quantum computing infrastructure in Europe.</p>  <p>  Quantum technology is an area which is also being given significant support at European level, most significantly with the launch of the &euro;1bn Quantum Flagship in 2018, funded under Horizon 2020, the current Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.  This support is expected to continue into the successor programme, Horizon Europe, where there will be significant funding available to researchers in this area of study.  The European Commission has supported quantum technologies over the last 20 years with a cumulative investment reaching around &euro;550m to-date and it will remain an area with significant potential for Irish researchers.  </p>  <p>  As the above activities show, we are building on our capabilities in the field of quantum technology.  One of our key objectives will be to nurture the growth of Quantum Technologies by translating science to innovation and by developing and attracting talent with quantum expertise in Ireland. Ireland&rsquo;s policy of Research Prioritisation highlights ICT as a key enabler of technologies, bringing radical changes throughout almost every industry in manufacturing, production processes, services provision and across whole value chains and business support activities, as well as driving the development of new markets. While technologies continue to evolve rapidly and significantly, the importance of the Future Networks, Communications and Internet of Things area as an integral underlying component of business and enterprise has remained indisputable.</p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland 2019 underlines the Government&rsquo;s determination for our enterprises and workers to be well prepared for the challenges and opportunities ahead in light of emerging and new technologies and sets out a range of priority deliverables in 2019 to position our economy accordingly.  One such priority is the development of a national strategy on Artificial Intelligence. It is my expectation that it will provide a high-level direction to the development and adoption of AI in Ireland based on international experience and activity including at the EU level and on foot of a broad consultation process with Irish stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with its agencies, will continue to remain active in this very important area. </p></reply>

In return for cooperation with the service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) over the next four years. This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease programme.</p>  <p>  As part of this package, the financial allowance available under the Rural Practice Support Framework will be increased by 10% in 2020. There will also be increased support for GPs working in disadvantaged urban areas. Improvements in the maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been agreed, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family friendly commitments. </p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures help make general practice more sustainable and help make general practice a more attractive career option for doctors.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;distance code&rdquo; was removed as a factor in calculating GP fees and allowances in 2010. Under the previous arrangements, certain fees payable to GPs such as capitation and out of hours fees varied according to a patient's age, gender and distance of their residence from the GP's surgery.</p>  <p>  To accurately cost a reinstatement of the previous "distance code" arrangement would require a detailed exercise by the HSE, which would involve establishing a database for the current population of GMS patients containing their age, gender and distance of their residence from their GP's surgery. As the HSE does not maintain such a database, it is not possible to provide a cost estimate in respect of this element of the Deputy's question.</p>  <p>  In relation to the cost of increasing the financial supports available to rural practices by the amounts specified, as this is a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This process has involved reviewing the 106 sub-actions of the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy - which was published in August 2018 - and identifying where further actions were required. A readiness assessment of all the sub-actions was then initiated, which examined the degree to which there were plans and assigned responsibilities, behind the subactions, both new and existing. Finally, the Programme Implementation Office looked at how best to structure teams for successful and effective delivery. </p>  <p>  A Citizen Care Masterplan Framework for the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare actions was developed in order to establish a programmatic approach to delivery. The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019 was published on 13 March 2019. It is a detailed and comprehensive plan for the first year of health and social care reform which firmly establishes a programmatic approach to the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare Strategy. It is a fundamental milestone in the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision for reformed health and social care services in Ireland. As part of the Action Plan, four main Workstreams were devised to drive healthcare reform:</p>  <p>  - Workstream 1: Service Redesign &amp;amp; Supporting Infrastructure</p>  <p>  - Workstream 2: Safe Care, Co-ordinated Governance &amp;amp; Value for Money</p>  <p>  - Workstream 3: Teams of the Future</p>  <p>  - Workstream 4: Sharing Progress.</p>  <p>  - Workstream 1 seeks to provide the right care, in the right place, at the right time, where the patient/service user is paramount. As part of this objective, there is a strong emphasis on prevention, including a complete programme on health and wellbeing.  This includes sustaining the ongoing cross-Government implementation of Healthy Ireland, with a focus on supporting and empowering people to look after their own health and wellbeing, and tackling health inequalities.</p>  <p>  - There is an ongoing focus on the health and wellbeing of children and young people across a number of policy areas under Healthy Ireland, such as obesity prevention and physical activity, in addition to cross-government collaboration on the implementation of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures child policy framework and the First Five whole of government strategy for babies, young children and their families.</p>  <p>  - The HSE National Service Plan for 2019 commits to progressing the Early Years Intervention Programme, including the National Healthy Childhood and Nurture Infant Health and Wellbeing Programmes. These programmes will be progressed in line with commitments in the First Five strategy and include measures to ensure the timing and content of the childhood screening and surveillance programme are consistent with the evidence base and standardised across the country. Work is also continuing to support parents with high quality, evidence-based information and services on various aspects of parenting to support child development, positive mental health and family relationships, including through the new mychild.ie website.</p></reply>

Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. </p><p>The joint Department of Health/HSE/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published recently and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan will place a strong focus on a number of high-volume procedures, including orthopaedics. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these procedures.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy has been provided to my Department by the NTPF and is contained in the document attached. The NTPF advise that the document sets out the average number of days waiting for shoulder arthroscopy at the end of December for each of the years 2015-2018, and for the end of March 2109. It should be noted that the table sets out the waiting time at each specific point in time.</p></reply>

The Agreement commits to 90% pay restoration by the end of 2020.  All public servants (excluding teachers who did not agree to the PSSA) received a 1% increase in October 2018. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Public Sector Pay Commission in its analysis of health sector grades, did not identify Occupational Therapists or Speech and Language Therapists as grades where recruitment or retention difficulties were being experienced.  It did identify Public Dentistry as having challenges and this is being looked at further by the Commission in Phase Two of its work. </p>  <p>  Opportunities for professionals who choose to seek employment in the private sector or abroad is an issue which faces all public employers.  However, the measures outlined above in terms of pay restoration and the work of the Pay Commission should assist in making working in the Irish health service more attractive to potential candidates.</p></reply>

The Department engages in the following activities to promote and support the employment of people with a disability:</p>  <p>  -  Follows the Civil Service Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities</p>  <p>  -  Has a designated DLO to act as the point of contact for staff with disabilities, their line managers and the HR Unit to provide assistance and support to both staff and their line managers by the provision of information, advice and supports, where necessary</p>  <p>  -  Participates in the Job Shadow Initiative - in 2018 four people with a disability were placed in the Department under this initiative</p>  <p>  -  Provides SAFETalk training to staff</p>  <p>  In 2019 the Department will participate in the Willing Able Mentoring Programme and is considering the possibility of taking interns with an intellectual disability under the pilot Internship Programme being proposed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  My Department is collating the response in respect of agencies under its aegis other than the HSE and will respond to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Despite this significant level of service provision, demand continues to rise with the main reason for the increased demand relating to the demographics in the older people population for the area.</p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  The new statutory scheme currently being developed will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to how decisions are made on allocating services. For that reason, developing the new scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home support services. It will also help to improve access to the home support services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way. The development of a statutory scheme is a key action contained in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and is expected to be delivered in 2021. </p>  <p>  I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible in relation to the aspects of the Question pertaining to an individual case.</p></reply>

Secondly, no statutory bodies under the aegis of my Department have entered into specified ICT contracts over &euro;1m since 2014, with the exception of the HSE and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).</p><p>The HSE has entered into 94 contracts in excess of &euro;1m and the NMBI has entered into one contract in excess of &euro;1m. Due to the volume of information available, details are provided to the Deputy in the links that follow.  In the delivery of capital ICT projects, the HSE follows the principle of payment upon receipt of deliverables. For basic technical infrastructure or software licences, this means the vendor does not receive payment until HSE staff have confirmed receipt of the goods. Similarly, for large ICT applications, such as the delivery of new systems, the HSE normally pays the vendor only when the system has gone live in a particular site. In some cases, there may be agreed milestones prior to go live that trigger payments, but even in these cases vendors do not get paid until the HSE confirms that the deliverables corresponding to that milestone have been received.</p><p>Investment in ICT is a key enabler of my Department's eHealth strategy- An eHealth Strategy for Ireland, the HSE's Health and Information Plan, the NMBI's Statement of Strategy 2017-2019 and the cross-party Sl&aacute;intecare health service reform programme.  The contracts awarded have included vital ICT infrastructure and development necessary to provide up-to-date clinical systems and safe patient care at all levels of service provision.</p><p>I trust that this is of assistance to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p>  <p> 1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and</p>  <p> 2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p>  <p>  This report has been completed and was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. Preparation of the report involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report was informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years.</p>  <p>  The report was informed by the personal experiences and concerns of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery, including through written representations to me and my Department, those concerns raised in Parliamentary Questions on this subject, and the issues raised by the Mesh Survivors Ireland group at its meeting with me on 14 June 2018. I acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown by the women I met and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were often harrowing, deeply personal experiences.</p>  <p>  The priority issues relating to patient care which were raised by women suffering complications and by others on their behalf are addressed in the report recommendations and are being addressed by the HSE.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, were not formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, a number of women whose procedures were postponed wrote to me and my Department expressing concern at the impact that this is having on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.</p>  <p>  The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p>  <p>  The Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p>  <p>  -  the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p>  <p>  -  surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p>  <p>  -  the development of clinical guidance;</p>  <p>  -  the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p>  <p>  -  ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p>  <p>  -  ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p>  <p>  In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented.</p>  <p>  A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  The Group includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. The HSE has advised that it is unable to facilitate membership on the Advisory Group to every patient or patient group who has a mesh experience. The NWIHP has sought to have a range of mesh experiences from the patient&rsquo;s perspective represented by a patient advocate on the Group &ndash; including patients who have had mesh with post-operative problems, patients who have had successful mesh surgery and patients who are on the waiting list for a mesh procedure.  The HSE advises that women who wish to submit views or submissions to the overall work of the Group should contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at smi.nwihp@hse.ie.</p>  <p>  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that many women have already engaged with this pathway system and have attended centres for second opinion and follow up appointments.  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. </p>  <p>  The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the HSE on November 27 2018 to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, to be approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website within three months of receipt of the report, or sooner if completed. It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the HSE has advised that the final version of the Implementation Plan will be published on its website and submitted to my Department in coming weeks. </p>  <p>  At my recent meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.</p></reply>

An annual capitation payment of &euro;434.15 is payable in respect of each GMS patient over 70 years of age residing in a private nursing home approved by the HSE for periods in excess of 5 weeks.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, such as their pension and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held, such as their principal private residence or cash assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. </p>  <p>  The Scheme has no restrictions in place in relation to the sale of a home. However, if a participant in the Scheme were to sell an asset, such as a home, after their first financial assessment the proceeds of the sale would therefore become a cash asset. The three-year cap will then no longer apply and the participant must pay a contribution of 7.5% based on this cash asset.</p>  <p>  A participant in the scheme can request a financial review if 12 months have passed since their initial review. However, the HSE may review a financial assessment at any stage.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Regulation is to benefit patient safety and maintain confidence in the safety of medicines supplied to them. </p><p>S.I. No. 36 of 2019 provides that the Irish legislative system is consistent with the requirements of the Regulation<b>.</b>Nothing in the new national Regulations seeks to alter the existing legal and regulatory responsibilities of persons authorised to place medicinal products on the market or to supply them to the public. It will apply to manufacturers, wholesalers and pharmacy owners and pharmacists equally. These obligations of the Delegated Regulation and Statutory Instrument are legal requirements for legal persons authorised to supply medication. As such legal responsibility lies with the business owner and the individual authorised to supply the medication.</p><p>The Regulation provided a 3-year transition period, which commenced in 2016, to facilitate preparation for its introduction. Details of the requirements of the Delegated Regulation have been communicated to all sectors throughout this period by the Irish Medicines Verification Office, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union. </p><p>Recognising the concerns raised by stakeholders, and to ensure that above all, the normal supply of medicines to patients is maintained, it was decided to implement the system in a pragmatic manner and defer operating the offences provisions in the legislation for an initial period. This was to allow everyone involved to develop familiarity with the new arrangements and overcome any teething issues before we proceed to commencement of the enforcement provisions that deal with offences.

My Department is working on the development of draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of a Bill has been drafted and we are currently working closely with legal advisers on advice and legal quality control. The focus on matters relating to Brexit, including planning and preparing in a legal and legislative context, has unfortunately had an impact on progressing the Heads of Bill. However, subject to legal advice, I expect to bring the Heads of Bill to Government in May. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect in 2019 subject to the legislative process.</p></reply>

Healthy Ireland is based on evidence and experience from around the world which clearly shows that to create positive changes in health and wellbeing takes the involvement of the whole of Government and all of society working in unison. Since Healthy Ireland was launched in March 2013, my Department has developed several policies and strategies to support population health and wellbeing, including obesity, physical activity, sexual health, tobacco and alcohol.</p><p>It is not possible to identify in totality how much funding is currently spent on improving health and wellbeing across all Government Departments and agencies and in wider society. </p><p>Since the launch of Healthy Ireland, expenditure on its implementation from within the budget of the Department of Health has amounted to the following:</p><p>2013 - &euro;89,315;</p><p>2014 - &euro;586,470;</p><p>2015 - &euro;607,706.83;</p><p>2016 - &euro;1,156,405; </p><p>2017 - &euro;5,996,837 (incl. the Healthy Ireland Fund)</p><p>2018 - &euro;5,586,906 (incl. the Healthy Ireland Fund)</p><p>2019 - &euro;622,514 (to date)</p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund was established in 2017, with an initial annual allocation of &euro;5 million, and aims to stimulate and support cross-sectoral action to support implementation of Healthy Ireland. </p><p>In addition to the expenditure noted above, other expenditure arising within the Department could also be described as &quot;Healthy Ireland&quot; depending on classification. </p><p>In relation to the cost of information campaigns, expenditure relating to the Healthy Ireland Communication and Citizen Engagement Campaign activity for 2018 amounted to &euro;758,585. The campaign, which is a Government priority campaign, focusses on three key themes, Healthy Eating, Physical Activity and Mental Wellbeing, and aims to encourage people to make positive choices to improve their physical and mental health, while also providing support and information to help people make those healthier choices. Campaign activity in 2018 included digital and social media activity, sponsored media articles and radio  advertising, to increase awareness of Healthy Ireland, promote the gov.ie/healthyireland resource and link people with relevant information and supports provided by partner organisations. The campaign is continuing in 2019, and the latest phase was launched on the 8th of April.</p><p>In July 2018, the Government made a decision to establish a Healthy Ireland Office in the Department of Health to co-ordinate and oversee the delivery of the above actions and to support strengthened cross-Government collaboration on the implementation of Healthy Ireland. Work to progress the establishment of this Office is underway.</p></reply>

Similarly, the total number of people reported as benefitting from national actions under Strand 2 was 130,735. The number of organisations benefitting was reported as 1,785, and almost two thirds of actions (63%) reported a focus on people with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses (including mental health issues) and over half of actions (54%) were focused on people living in areas of social disadvantage.</p>  <p>  In relation to the funding that has been made available by my Department annually since the inception of the Healthy Ireland Fund, and the outturn of these funds.  In 2017, &euro;5 million was provided in the Budget and was fully expended, in 2018, a further &euro;5 million was provided in the Budget and &euro;4,995,000 was expended.  The fund received a &euro;5 million allocation in Budget 2019.</p>  <p>  Funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Rural and Community Development has also been allocated towards the Healthy Ireland Fund in 2017 and 2018, demonstrating the commitment to the Healthy Ireland Framework across Government.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1 million is being made available, from within the additional development funding allocation made to the Department in revised estimates 2019 to the Healthy Ireland Fund to boost community engagement on health and wellbeing locally in each local authority area.</p></reply>

The continued recognition of professional qualifications is an issue of critical importance for the health system given the number of health care professionals who received their professional training in Ireland and work in the United Kingdom ( UK) or vice versa. </p><p>This issue has been considered in the context of the negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement and on the Framework for the Future Relationship. An EU/UK agreement on the  recognition of qualifications, were that to be achieved, would be expected to address the issue in the most comprehensive way possible.  </p><p>Should the UK leave on the basis of an agreed Withdrawal Agreement, including a transition period, the current EU Directive will continue to apply to the UK during that time.  The EU and the UK indicated in the Political Declaration setting out the framework of the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK that during negotiations they should develop appropriate arrangements for the recognition of those professional qualifications which are in the Parties' mutual interest.</p><p>Should the UK leave the EU on the basis of a No Deal scenario, Directive 2005/36/EC will no longer apply in the UK, or to UK qualifications, with effect from the withdrawal date.  </p><p>The Irish health professional regulators each have &ldquo;third country&rdquo; recognition routes which apply to qualifications which are obtained in neither the EEA nor in Ireland. They have considered these &ldquo;third country&rdquo; recognition routes with the objective of ensuring efficient routes for recognition of UK qualifications, while ensuring that this is done in an objective, evidence-based and non-discriminatory way.  The Irish regulators, including the nurse and midwife regulator, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), are satisfied that they can continue to recognise UK qualifications within approximately the same time frames and the same level of application fee, but under this different legal base. </p><p>These routes provide not only for the recognition of professional qualifications where education and training standards are equivalent in Ireland and in the country of training; but they also provide for the consideration of relevant post-qualification professional experience where, for example, training standards differ or where an applicant may possess an older, foreign qualification which does not meet the current Irish reference standards.  </p><p>The NMBI has information on the implications of Brexit on its website at <i>www.nmbi.ie/Registration/Brexit.</i></p><p>In relation to the post-Brexit recognition of Irish  health professional qualifications in the UK, the UK has prepared its European Qualifications (Health and Social Care Profession) Regulations 2018 which it is intended to enact in the case of a no-deal Brexit.  This legislation will enable Irish health professional qualifications, including those in nursing, to be recognised in the UK.  </p><p>It is important to note that decisions on qualification recognition already made under the EU Directive remain valid and professionals can continue to practice in either jurisdiction subject, of course, to compliance with all regulations within that profession.</p></reply>

This applies to all Member States and cannot be reviewed or amended unilaterally.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, although this ceiling on State aid remains effective, they are currently revising their published guidance manual on the stamp duty element of the relief. This revision will confirm that, where a young trained farmer receives or buys farmland from certain relatives and is eligible for &lsquo;consanguinity relief&rsquo;, this relief can be applied before the young trained farmer relief on the transfer of the land.  As consanguinity relief operates by charging a reduced 1% rate of stamp duty (instead of the usual 6% rate on farmland), the amount of relief calculated under that scheme (i.e. state aid granted) would be significantly reduced for many young trained farmers, thus ensuring that they do not breach the &euro;70,000 ceiling as a result of the young trained farmer scheme.  </p>  <p>  Supporting young farmers and generational renewal continues to be a priority and will form an important part of the CAP post-2020.  My Department and I are actively engaging with other Member States and the EU Commission on these issues during the current negotiations on the new CAP proposals.</p></reply>

Capturing the claim map in a digital form allows for the accurate measurement and calculation of the payment area. The process of electronically capturing the claim map is referred to as digitisation. </p>  <p>  Digitisation of a forest area is initially carried out following receipt of an application for a forest grant and is based on the claim map submitted by the applicant (or his/her agent/forester). The claimed area is the total area of the forest plots specified by the applicant in the application. The digitised area of a contract (i.e. the entire plantation) is the sum of the areas of the individual forest plots comprising that plantation. For each plot contained in an application for payment, the digitised area is the entire area of the forest plot within the perimeter boundary of that plot measured by the iFORIS system. </p>  <p>  The determined (payable) area of a forest needs to be distinguished from the total digitised area for grant payment. During the lifetime of a forestry contract (15-20 years under the afforestation scheme), periodic inspections and desk checks are carried out by the Department to confirm if the initially digitised area still corresponds with the actual size and composition of the forest planted and in accordance with scheme terms &amp;amp; conditions.</p>  <p>  The determined forest area is calculated by excluding any ineligible areas (e.g. power line corridors, rock, gas lines, ineligible land, etc.) and may occasionally change due to, for example, the removal of trees, submission of revised mapping data by the applicant (or by the applicant&rsquo;s agent/forester) or following desk checks against more recent ortho photography.  Any difference between the determined area and the area claimed by an applicant requires a case-by-case investigation and the forest area may have to be re-digitised as a result. In cases where the determined area is found to be less than the claimed area or the previous determined area, a situation might arise where grant payments need to be adjusted to the newly determined area.</p>  <p>  In implementing inspections, a fair and consistent approach is the objective of the Department at all times, and inspections by Department officers are guided by established standard procedures.</p>  <p>  Where an area reduction is made by the Department, the applicant is notified and given an opportunity to seek a review.  </p></reply>

There are currently two Irish ports that have been designated for landings by vessels from a third country - Killybegs in Donegal and Castletownbere in Cork.  </p>  <p>  When the UK formally becomes a third country and the Common Fisheries Policy no longer applies to it, UK-registered vessels will be restricted to landing fish at those two ports.

Engagement with the sector has included visits by my officials to places of production, detailed consultations with stakeholder representatives including IBEC and Forest Industries Ireland, and direct discussions with companies operating in the sector. The objective has been to both explain the new phytosanitary import and export requirements that will arise as a result of the UK leaving the EU, and to inform my Department's own planning and communications activities. Follow-up to these engagements has involved email correspondence, one to one contact and the publication and update of relevant information on my Department's website, at <i></i>.</p><p>I have introduced a number of measures under the last three budgets aimed at improving competitiveness, and developing market and product diversification.

Further information may be accessed on the DAFM website at: <i></i>. This Scheme is in addition to, for example, the &euro;78m Brexit package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs related to Brexit introduced in Budget 2019. </p><p>My Department has also sharpened its Brexit communications strategy, which now includes an enhanced Brexit page on the Department&rsquo;s website, the circulation of focused Trader Notices to the relevant sectors, the establishment of a Brexit Call Centre, central e-mail address and increased use of social media.  I would urge Irish wood producers and wood product businesses to engage with these services as we continue our preparations for Brexit. </p></reply>

I announced this decision following an extensive and detailed public consultation process.  Over 900 submissions were received during the public consultation comprising a wide diversity of views.  I carefully considered the issues raised during the process, including safety concerns, and following a detailed evaluation, decided to exclude trawling by vessels over 18m in length overall from inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020.  Trawling for sprat by vessels over 18m will be phased out by 31 December 2021.</p>  <p>  While the overall responsibility for safety at sea rests with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Authority will only issue or renew a Sea Fishing Boat Licence if the vessel has a current safety certificate.</p>  <p>  As this review was carried out following a full and open public consultation, I do not see any basis for reopening this matter. </p></reply>

Those meetings have now produced a report which proposes that a new assessment method should be applied to the mackerel stock. </p>  <p>  ICES have now confirmed that they will proceed to review the 2019 advice utilising this new method with a view to publication before the 15th of May.  It is not expected that the overall Total Allowable Catch (TAC) already agreed for 2019 will change in consequence of this new advice.

These concerns were also acknowledged by ICES. </p>  <p>  Throughout the autumn, Ireland, working in cooperation with other interested Member States, sought an urgent review by ICES of the data inputs used in reaching their conclusions on the catch advice. Other Coastal States, as well as ICES themselves, supported this review.  </p>  <p>  The Mackerel Coastal States (EU, Norway, Faeroes, Iceland, Russia and Greenland) representatives are scheduled to meet following the publication of the new 2019 advice in May.

This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and is in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy and the 7 Point Action Plan on market access that I launched in April 2017. </p>  <p>  The opening of the Chinese beef market to  Irish beef in 2018 was a notable success, following several years of effort. My officials are currently in the process of trying to get additional beef establishments approved by the Chinese authorities and to progress our sheepmeat application to China. These will be the subject of discussions on my Trade Mission to China next month.  During 2018, markets for Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry were also opened in Kuwait and Qatar.  I also recently announced the opening of the Ukrainian market to Irish beef and pigmeat. </p>  <p>  My Department requested Bord Bia to undertake an exercise to identify priority markets which can be targeted for promotion, markets access applications and trade missions. This exercise provides an invaluable tool for Irish exporters and for the Department and its agencies in determining the strategic priorities for agri-food trade.  In relation to meat, the 5 priority markets identified were Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico and Malaysia.  Significant market access work is underway in relation to each of these markets at present and, in this regard, I will lead a trade mission to Japan &amp;amp; South Korea in June.</p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of global  meat markets are strong, with growing global demand projected from fast developing countries with increasing middle classes and more westernised diets. There is confidence that the Irish food industry is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand, underpinned by the success of our efforts and those of the Irish food industry. </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to "Grass-fed", Bord Bia and Teagasc are undertaking exploration of the development of &ldquo;Grass-fed&rdquo; standards in the dairy sector, with the potential to extend to other livestock types. </p></reply>

This report reaffirms the overall conclusion of an earlier 2007 report, &ldquo;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo;, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects. </p>  <p>  This Department continues to monitor scientific developments in this area. </p></reply>

A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 78 fast chargers as a part of the ESB eCars network. In addition there are public chargers provided by local authorities, retail outlets and private companies. </p>  <p>  Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. This project successfully completed the assessment stage and the validation stage is now underway. The project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models. A provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations of charging hubs, was developed by ESB eCars and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  ESB eCars is currently identifying the most appropriate locations for the chargers to be sited. The sites will be identified using the latest software mapping techniques, taking account of information on current charge point usage, traffic volume, accessibility, amenities and grid capacity at the sites. </p>  <p>  Businesses, including service stations, can avail of Accelerated Capital Allowance for the purchase and installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  This scheme enables businesses to invest in energy efficient equipment, including electric charging infrastructure, and write down the cost of such equipment in the year of purchase rather than over 8 years. </p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is in the process of transposing the latest revisions to the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive which, by March 2020 at the latest, will set the following requirements:</p>  <p>  - New residential buildings (and those undergoing major renovation) with more than ten parking spaces will be required to install ducting to provide for the future installation of charge points in all parking spaces.</p>  <p>  - New non-residential buildings (and those undergoing major renovation) with more than ten parking spaces will be required to install at least one charge point and ducting to provide for the future installation of charge points in at least one in every five parking spaces.</p>  <p>  - From 2025, all non-residential buildings with more than twenty parking spaces will be required to install a minimum number of charge points.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the SEAI, is working on how best to support the provision of greater levels of on-street public charging.</p></reply>

It is particularly difficult for the Forum to deliver on its business when it is not achieving its established quorum to underpin its recommendations and inputs to the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI). </p>  <p>  In this regard, I would emphasise that following the last review of the Forum&rsquo;s operation the quorum was reduced to 20 members. This lower quorum was in place as the Forum entered its second iteration in October 2017 and, despite this modification, challenges in meeting even this lower level of participation persist.</p>  <p>  In that regard, I refer to question No. 492 of 9 April when I indicated the potential need for further review of the Forum to address the impact of continued poor attendance by stakeholders. </p>  <p>  A letter of resignation from the Chair was received in my Department on 19 January 2019. The process to appoint a new Chair is in hand and as indicated it is expected that meetings will resume when that process and any review of the Forum&rsquo;s operation is complete. </p></reply>

matters referred to in the Question and in the tables which follow.  In particular, I would like to explain briefly the development of legislation on intoxicated driving in the period to which the Deputy refers.</p><p>The Road Traffic Act 2010 consolidated and updated legislation across the range of intoxicated driving offences.  Its core provisions, including offences relating to driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while being under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of controlling the vehicle, were commenced in 2011.  Also commenced at that time were new provisions for lower legal alcohol limits.  These reduced the permissible alcohol limit from 80mg per 100ml of blood to 50mg.  In addition, a 'specified driver' - including learner and novice drivers, truck and bus drivers, and drivers of small public service vehicles - is held to a 20mg limit.</p><p>Section 29 of the 2010 Act allowed people detected in the 50-80mg  and 80-100mg alcohol brackets to receive a fixed charge notice rather than going to court in certain limited circumstances.  People in the lower of these brackets receive a fixed charge of &euro;200 and in the higher of the two a fixed charge of &euro;400.  Those in the 80-100mg group also receive a 6 month driving disqualification.  Those in the 50-80mg group originally received 3 penalty points, but the Oireachtas wisely agreed that this was unduly lenient and an inadequate deterrent, and replaced it in 2018 with a 3 month disqualification.</p><p>The 2010 Act was amended in 2014 to provide for new procedures for taking specimens from drivers in hospital if they were incapacitated following a collision.  Where a person is conscious and refuses to provide a specimen for testing for intoxicants they commit an offence; under the 2014 provisions the person commits an analogous offence if they refuse permission for a certificate of the test result to be issued.  In 2014 provisions to allow Garda&iacute; to conduct impairment tests - walking a straight line and so on - and refusal to comply with a requirement to undergo these tests became an offence.</p><p>In 2016 the law was amplified to add new permitted limits for three drugs - cocaine, cannabis, and heroin.  At the same time new tests for drugs were introduced, with new offences for failure to comply with a requirement to undergo these tests. </p><p>In 2018 the law was amended to create a new offence for the owner of a vehicle who allows a unaccompanied learner or an unlicensed driver to drive their vehicle.  The penalty is a Class D fine.</p><p>In the tables which follow, the General Penalty is the penalty prescribed by section 102 of the Road Traffic Act 102, and which applies to all road traffic offences on conviction in court, except where a different penalty for that offence is specifically provided for in the law.  The General Penalty is a fine of up to &euro;1,000 for a first offence, up to &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence, and up to &euro;2,000 and/or up to 6 months in prison for a third or subsequent offence within a 12-month period.</p><p>Table 1 -

No. 415 of 2017), provide the legal basis under which proof of identification is required by an NCT Test Centre when a vehicle is presented for roadworthiness testing.  The Regulations permit an NCT Test Centre to withhold a vehicle&rsquo;s test certificate until identification has been produced.  The Data Protection Commissioner has deemed a driving licence to be the most appropriate form of identification for this purpose, as a driver is required to produce a driving licence when operating a vehicle in a public place.</p>  <p>  The Regulations also permit the details on the form of identification to be recorded by an NCT Test Centre.  The data recorded is held for a period of 12 months and then deleted.  As the Data Protection Commissioner would not permit the recording and retention of passport details, the use of a passport for identification purposes was stopped.</p>  <p>  The recorded identification details allows the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to trace cars for follow-up quality inspections, particularly where there has been a recent change in ownership.  In addition, the application of these measures also acts as a deterrent to fraudulent activity in relation to roadworthiness testing.  It is important information to help identify and investigate unusual patterns of activity relating to test quality or outcomes, where a common thread in such unusual patterns may involve the presenter of the vehicle(s). </p></reply>

However Councils are requested to prioritise projects which involve strengthening works, remedying road defects, winter maintenance and drainage works.</p><p>Bridge Rehabilitation (BR):This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake bridge rehabilitation works. </p><p>Safety Improvement Works (BS)  : This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake safety improvement works. </p><p>Ring-fenced funding is  available for the Community Involvement Scheme (CIS) and a Drainage Programme.  The CIS facilitates community involvement in repair and improvement of public roads while the purpose of the Drainage Grantis to promote network resilience. </p><p>Specific Grant and Strategic Grants:The Department no longer seeks annual applications from local authorities in respect of the Specific (road improvement schemes costing up to &euro;5m.) and Strategic (improvement schemes costing over &euro;5m.) grant programmes. Instead it considers projects on a case by case basis taking into account the availability of funding and the outcome of project appraisals.</p><p>Overall grant funding for regional and local roads in 2019 is &euro;483 million.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) an Employee&rsquo;s medical history, including a disability, is classified as &ldquo;sensitive personal data&rdquo;, this allows it additional protections under GDPR. In the interest of complying with the terms of GDPR, and protecting an individual&rsquo;s anonymity, the numbers of staff members who disclose intellectual disabilities are not specifically tracked by the Department and there are no plans to do so.</p>  <p>  The Department actively promotes opportunities and support for individuals with disclosed disabilities. This includes participation in the Willing Able Mentoring Programme (WAM), which is a work placement graduate programme for individuals with disabilities, and the appointment of a designated Disability Liaison Officer who provides advice and support to staff members who have disclosed a disability and to line managers of staff members who have disclosed a disability. </p>  <p>  Under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities for 2015 &ndash; 2024, the Government has committed to progressively increasing the statutory target for the employment of people with disabilities from 3% to a minimum of 6% in the public sector by 2024. The National Disability Authority&rsquo;s (NDA) most recently published report confirms that 3.9% of staff within this Department have a disclosed disability. </p>  <p>  I have asked the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department to provide the Deputy with a statement on the information requested.  If you do not receive a reply from the agencies within 10 working days please advise my private office.</p></reply>

This review will include consideration of the timing and scale of the next round but I fully expect that the SCP will again be open for new applications before the end of this year.    </p>  <p>  In relation to larger sports projects. the National Sports Policy was published on 25th July 2018 and provided for a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100 million available over the coming years. The fund was launched in November 2018 and closes for applications on Wednesday of this week (17th April 2019). The fund is initially focused on the requirements and development plans of National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities, all of which received letters inviting them to make applications. Decisions on the timing of the next round of the LSSIF will be taken once the assessment of all applications is complete and grants have been announced. </p></reply>

Due to decades of under investment , we have inherited one of the most expensive models of early learning and care in Europe. Along with my colleagues in Government, I have been working to incrementally address this under investment.  </p>  <p>  In recent years, I have secured significantly increased funding for early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC). The annual investment towards high quality, affordable ELC and SAC has risen to &euro;574m, which represents an increase of  117% since 2015.</p>  <p>  The significant increase in supports I announced in April 2017 represented a major step towards accessible, affordable and quality ELC and SAC after decades of neglect and under-investment by successive Governments. These increases reflect my ambition to support quality ELC and SAC services with appropriately supported staff. </p>  <p>  As part of the Government policy to make childcare more affordable, I  introduced new measures in September 2017 (September Measures) aimed at improving access to quality, affordable childcare for families in the interim until the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The September Measures included the universal childcare subvention payment (CCSU) of up to &euro;20 per week for families using eligible childcare providers for the care of children aged from 6 months to the first eligible point of entry to the ECCE scheme.  This non means tested support amounts to as much as &euro;1,040 per year for children in full time childcare.  The total number of children who availed of CCSU in the 2017/2018 programme year (between September 2017 and August 2018) was 39,319. Almost two thirds of services (65% or 2,188) that had CCSP contracts, had at least one child registered under CCSU.</p>  <p>  To date 33,410 children have availed of CCSU in the current (2018/2019) year.</p>  <p>  The September Measures also included an average 50% increase to the band rates of the CCS/CCSP targeted schemes.  In 2017/18 36,367 children benefitted from the targeted CCS strands (CCS and CCSP) compared to 24,715 in 2016/17.  This was an increase of 47% on the previous year.  The growth in the number of registrations and participating children is associated directly with the increase investment in the early year&rsquo;s sector.  For the period September 2017 to June 2018 the value of the registrations amounted to &euro;363,691,841.  These increases were considerable and significantly decreased the amount of payment required of low income families or parents in education or training.</p>  <p>  These changes are waypoints towards our goal to deliver genuine affordable, accessible, quality ELC and SAC. </p>  <p>  In 2018 the Oireachtas signed the Childcare Support Act; putting the entitlement to financial support for childcare on a legislative footing for the first time. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), which is a new, national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare, will be a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable childcare to families throughout Ireland.  NCS will launch this October, with payments flowing from November. The Scheme entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies that will benefit a much greater part of the population, and in particularly working families.  It is a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme which will ultimately replace the existing targeted childcare schemes. </p>  <p>  By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has already been amended to expand the benefits for working families. As part of Budget 2019, the income threshold levels used for assessing the level of subsidy to which a parent may be entitled were raised. </p>  <p>  The significant increase in the Scheme's maximum net income threshold from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000 per annum means that an estimated 7,500 more children will benefit from the scheme relative to the original proposals.  Over 40,000 other children, already eligible, will see increases to their subsidies.</p>  <p>  I am also very pleased that I have managed to adjust the lower income threshold, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (up from &euro;22,700). </p>  <p>  This &lsquo;poverty proofs&rsquo; the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme. It will also make work pay for parents in employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.</p>  <p>  It will take time to deliver the world class system of early learning and care that families deserve but I am confident that we are moving swiftly in the right direction to achieve this goal. </p></reply>

In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible. The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. This 'poverty-proofs' the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme.  It will also make work pay for parents trying to get back into employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.  Many working families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly.  Others will see an increase in their level of subsidy.  For example, a family with a child aged two in full-time care (40 hours) and currently benefitting from the maximum subsidy of &euro;145 per week under CCS Band A, would see their subsidy increase to &euro;174 per week, an additional subsidisation of &euro;1,500 per annum.</p><p>Arrangements are in place to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme. So, whilst there may have been fears that, in a small number of cases, where a family currently receiving the maximum amount of financial support for full-time childcare under an existing programme may receive less under the new Scheme, particularly if their child is, in reality, receiving afterschool care only rather than full-time childcare, they will not lose out.  The family can continue to access their current targeted supports (i.e. effectively remain on their current payment) until the end of August 2020, 16 months from now.</p><p>I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents.  In this regard, I would highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.</p><p>The Scheme is designed so that families who need the most support can receive it. Maximum subsidy rates are payable in all cases where a family meets the lowest income threshold, tapering down smoothly as income increases.</p><p>An Income Assessed subsidy is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy will vary depending on family income, the child&rsquo;s age and their educational stage. It can be used towards the cost of a registered childcare place for up to a maximum of 40 hours per week where parents are working, studying or training, or in circumstances where a parent is unavailable to care for a child. Where parents are not working, studying or training, the subsidy will be paid for up to a maximum of 15 hours per week.</p><p>In order to qualify for enhanced hours (i.e. up to a maximum of 40 hours per week), <i>both</i>the applicant and the applicant&rsquo;s partner, if applicable, must meet at least one of the following criteria, they must be:</p><p>- In work </p><p>- In study  </p><p>- Transitioning into, or out of, work or study </p><p>- Unavailable to provide childcare for the child.</p><p>Finally, as set out in my answer to your Parliamentary Question in December 2016, my officials have engaged with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) and have received reassurance that, if a situation arose where childcare costs increased such that a lone parent in receipt of Jobseekers Transition Payment (JST) would withdraw from a course of education or training, they would not lose their JST payment as a result of the withdrawal. JST recipients have an obligation to engage with DEASP as regards their activation under Jobseekers Transitional payment, but each case is treated individually and their local Case Officer can take into account any circumstances arising which may affect the customer and the welfare of their children.</p></reply>

One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year helps to streamline the administration process and makes it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. It also makes it easier for parents to secure places on the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) for their children. </p>  <p>  This policy change, along with the reduction of the minimum age requirement to 2 years and 8 months,  ensured that from September 2018, all children will be eligible for a full two programme years on the ECCE programme. This measure adds to previous enhancement of the programme and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from the original 38 weeks to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years) delivering on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  The upper age limit for the ECCE programme remains the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they will be 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year.) The upper age limit for the ECCE programme was set in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills. It ensures that children transition into primary school with their peers and limits the age range of children beginning primary school. Limiting the diversity in age ranges in children beginning primary school education is considered generally to be in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.</p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly. As stated above, the Department of Education and Skills informed the policy which these rules support.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that age limits have been used to determine eligibility since the inception of the ECCE programme in 2010. These rules are a necessary component of any Government scheme and ensure that Exchequer funding is used for its intended purpose.</p></reply>

I have no function in relation to decisions in this regard. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, on a phased basis, the first revaluation of that scale, encompassing all rating authority areas, in over 160 years. </p><p>The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide a modern statutory framework for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.</p><p>Under the current phase of the revaluation programme, Proposed Valuation Certificates were issued in March 2019 to ratepayers in the Cavan, Fingal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow rating authority areas.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation and the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority as part of their reserved functions. </p><p>The proposed valuation entered on the Proposed Valuation Certificates is not a bill for rates. It is a statement of the valuation that the Commissioner proposes to set with effect from 1st January 2020.  In order to arrive at an estimated rates liability for 2020 and subsequent years, the proposed valuation provided by the Valuation Office would need to be multiplied by the indicative ARV published by the relevant local authority. </p><p>Following the issue of circa 32,000 Proposed Valuation Certificates (PVCs) on 15 March 2019, as part of REVAL2019, the Valuation Office held 50 walk in clinics across the eight local authorities being revalued. The location of the clinics took account of the overall number of rateable properties and the distribution of the main centres of population within each local authority area. On 29 March 2019, the Valuation Office issued a further c. 3,500 PVCs mainly relating to licensed premises, hotels, service stations and nursing homes. In advance of that issue, the Office provided specimen PVC documents to the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI), the Irish Hotels Federation (IHF), Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) and the Irish Petrol Retailers Association (IPRA) and offered to provide briefing sessions to their members. These briefing sessions are now underway and have been arranged in advance of the further walk-in clinics as much as possible. In addition, the Valuation Office has advised the aforementioned trade bodies of the dates, times and venues of additional Walk in Clinics across the eight local authorities. In total, a further 14 Walk in Clinics will take place between now and 25 April.</p><p>Having up to date and consistent valuations, reflecting current market conditions, is critical to ensure that the levying of commercial rates is on a fair, equitable and consistent basis across all economic sectors and parts of the country and is the purpose of the national revaluation programme. </p><p>In order to ensure that the revaluation promotes equity across sectors and areas, but is also a revenue neutral exercise in overall terms, the Minister may limit the total amount of rates collectable within the local authority in the year following a revaluation to that collected in the previous year, subject to minor adjustments. In overall terms, I understand that of the revaluations conducted to to  date, approximately 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced and  approximately 40% have experienced an increase. </p><p>I understand that the Valuation Office has held walk in clinics on 15 and 16 April 2019, in various locations around County Wexford following the issuing of the PVCs. Valuation Office staff were present in each location to answer queries, explain the revaluation process and offer guidance on making representations.  </p><p>Any ratepayer who is ultimately dissatisfied with any of the particulars on their Proposed Valuation Certificate can submit representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days from the date of issue of their certificate. The closing date for submitting representations is clearly stated on each  Certificate.</p><p>There is no fee for submitting a representation, which can be made by using the Property Number and PIN on the Proposed Valuation Certificate online on the Valuation Office website, <i>www.valoff.ie</i>. The Valuation Office considers all representations and commits to making merited adjustments based on the information provided as part of the representations process. </p><p>There is also available a right of appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal for ratepayers that are dissatisfied with the final valuation. In the case of the current areas being revalued the final valuation is expected in September with the list to be published in October and the final appeal date in November. </p></reply>

The task force was requested to oversee and report on a number of initial steps, and to urgently consider any potential life safety issues and appropriate responses.</p><p>In addition to establishing the fire safety task force, I requested that a number of immediate initial actions be taken, including directing fire authorities to carry out a survey to identify buildings in their individual functional areas of more than six storeys, or more than 18m in height, fitted with external cladding or rain screen systems, with or without insulation.  To support the work being undertaken by fire authorities, my Department issued guidance developed under the aegis of the task force in 2017, dealing with assessment of cladding systems, and providing information on interim fire safety measures to be applied to buildings, pending completion of remedial works. Fire authorities were advised that site visits would be required to confirm information, including whether cladding to the buildings is present.  </p><p>Where buildings of more than six storeys, or more than 18m in height, with cladding or cladding systems present, were identified, fire authorities were advised to consider whether use of section 18(6)(a) of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 &ndash; to require the person having control over the premises to carry out a fire safety assessment of the premises, including issues like fire detection and alarm systems as well as the cladding system and concealed spaces (cavities) in the external wall construction &ndash; was warranted.This work in relation to medium-to-high rise buildings has been carried out, and all fire authorities have reported back to my Department, as requested, and the summary of this work is included in the fire safety task force's report published by my Department in May 2018 which is available at the following link: <i></i></p><p>A number of medium-to-high rise buildings were identified as having external cladding, and, where deemed warranted by fire authorities, building owners have been required, using powers under the Fire Services Acts, to undertake fire safety assessments in these specific buildings, in some case of fire safety aspects other than cladding. My Department received summary information in this regard from the fire authorities; accordingly, details of individual buildings which were identified and appraised are not available in my Department.</p><p>The most recent figures provided to my Department from Dublin Fire Brigade indicate that fire safety assessments were required in respect of 63 buildings (21 residential, and 42 non-residential); 57 assessments have been received, 5 assessments are in preparation, and 1 building remains vacant.</p><p>So far, further action, including remedial works, has been required in respect of 7 buildings, including 4 cases involving remedial works to cladding installations.  </p><p>Remedial works to cladding installations, where required, are subject to the requirements of Building Regulations, and generally require a fire safety certificate, and compliance with the requirements of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, including the submission of a commencement notice to the building control authority with accompanying documentation, design certifier, and assigned certifier on completion.</p></reply>

The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders.  The standardised protocol was published by the NSAI on 13 November 2018 and &lsquo;I.S. 465:2018 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials&rsquo;, is available at <i>www.nsai.ie</i>.</p><p>The standard can be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite.  Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks, in order to decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.  The standard:</p><p>1. establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of  deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite); </p><p>2. describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem; </p><p>3. describes the scope of any testing required; and </p><p>4. categorises buildings, in  accordance with the standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference.  Engineers Ireland has provided assurance that they are in the process of finalising measures to establish such a register now that the standardised protocol is in place.  Engineers Ireland have issued a call for suitably qualified engineers to participate on the register.  They have recently announced that training will be provided in May for those engineers with the aim of ensuring consistency throughout the industry in assessing and categorising the damage. </p><p>In 2017, I visited Donegal and Mayo and met with key stakeholders, including affected homeowners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties.  I made similar visits to both counties last year and I will continue to monitor the situation and to update affected parties on progress. </p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  Work on the development of such a scheme is well underway, including discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the operation and funding of the scheme.  It is intended to revert to Government with proposals for the scheme shortly, with a view to publishing details of the scheme thereafter.</p></reply>

The Taskforce is also charged with identifying barriers and local issues that are impeding housing delivery in general in Galway.  A key priority for the Taskforce will be to encourage local authorities to work together, including sharing resources and services to the greatest extent possible, in terms of housing delivery.  A critical role of the Taskforce will be to increase the delivery of social housing homes, particularly new build homes, by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and local authorities in Galway City and Galway County over the coming years. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce is being chaired by Ms. Geraldine Tallon, former Secretary General, who also currently chairs the Cork Social Housing Taskforce.  The membership of the Taskforce includes Mr. Brendan McGrath, Chief Executive of Galway City Council and Mr. Kevin Kelly, Chief Executive of Galway County Council, along with the Housing Directors of both local authorities.  Mary Hurley, Assistant Secretary with responsibility for Housing Delivery at my Department is also a member of the Taskforce, as well as other relevant Housing and Planning officials from my Department.  The Taskforce membership also includes Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor, Chief Executive of the Housing Agency, Ms. Eadaoin Ni Chleirigh, Irish Council of Social Housing and Mr. Alan Cunniffe, Co-operative Housing Ireland. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that a meeting took place recently between the Chair, the two local authorities and my Department in relation to the work programme for the Taskforce, which will hold its first meeting on 25 April 2019.</p></reply>

Enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p><p>In addition, local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. </p><p>In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. </p><p>While my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p><p>Indeed, it is not possible for the State to take on responsibility/liability for all legacy issues of defective building materials or workmanship. Nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance.</p><p>In response to building failures, the Government has embarked on a three pronged Building Control Reform Agenda to reduce the risk of similar problems occurring again. These are:</p><p>- Reform of the Building Control process; </p><p>- Establishment of a National Building Control Management Project; and</p><p>- Putting the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing.</p><p>This focus on strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance in the building regulations, reduces the risk and the incidences of defective buildings and has provided insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to introduce new latent defect type products in Ireland, despite a general retrenchment and conservatism in the wider insurance industry. </p><p>These new products are first party insurance policies, which cover damage and non-damage (breaches of buildings) claims, to varying degrees. This means that the purchaser does not have to make a claim through the builder but can submit a claim directly to the insurer. This would be of particular benefit to a homeowner in circumstances where the builder or developer has ceased trading.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report, the Task Force acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and makes a number of recommendations in this regard.  However, a widespread assessment or inspection process was not recommended rather a focus on a review of fire detection and alarms systems and evacuation arrangements, prioritising life safety.  I have tasked the Directorate's Management Board with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  The Task Force Report is available on my Department's website at the following link:<i>.</i></p><p>Finally, the building regulations are reviewed on an ongoing basis on foot of relevant EU legislation, in light of technical innovation and in recognition of international best practice in the construction sector and updated accordingly.  Work is ongoing on the review of Part B/TDG B Fire Safety. It has been decided in the interest of clarity to separate the guidance into two volumes.  A new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 was published in 2017 and came into force on 1 July 2017.  This Volume 2 applies to dwelling houses only.  Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwelling houses, is currently being prepared for public consultation.  This guidance document will provide greater clarity on the conditions required to demonstrate compliance with building regulations taking into account the changes in standards since the last review. </p></reply>

Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and put a plan in place for works to bring buildings into compliance.  They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.</p><p>However, in general, any such building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.

In August 2017, the  Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern.

The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations in 12 parts, Parts A to M. Part B (Fire safety) sets down the statutory minimum standards of fire safety provision. </p><p>Part III of the Building Control Regulations requires a Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) to be obtained for new buildings (with some exceptions) and certain works to existing buildings.  The FSC ensures the building/works if constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted, comply with the requirements of Part B of the Building Regulations.  As such, an application is examined technically, by the Chief Fire Officer /Building Control Authority, for compliance with Part B, either on the basis of TGD B or through alternative approaches to providing fire safety.</p><p>A right of appeal is also provided for in this Part of the Building Control Regulations, in instances where a building control authority grant a fire safety certificate with conditions, or refuse to grant a fire safety certificate.  The applicant may appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la against the decision of the building control authority.  The Board is fully independent in the performance of these statutory functions. </p><p>Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.</p><p>Since the introduction of Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, (BCAR), greater accountability is required in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  This legislation empowers competence and professionalism in construction projects and establishes a chain of responsibility that begins with the owner. </p><p>In addition, under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, Building Control Authorities have strong powers of inspection, enforcement and prosecution. As such, the number of inspections is a matter for local authorities, who are independent in the use of their statutory powers the Acts.</p><p>In line with the agreed Performance Indicators for Local Government, Building Control Authorities are required to carry out a level of inspection equivalent to 12% to 15% of new buildings for which valid commencement notices have been received.  The National Oversight &amp;amp; Audit Commission (NOAC) now collects and publishes this data. The Performance Indicators in Local Authorities reports are available at <i>.</i></p></reply>

The reform is centred on three main initiatives:</p><p>- Reform of the Building Control process; </p><p>- Establishment of a National Building Control Management Project; and</p><p>- Putting the Construction Industry Register Ireland (CIRI) on a statutory footing.</p><p>Since the introduction of Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, (BCAR), greater accountability is required in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.  This legislation empowers competence and professionalism in construction projects and establishes a chain of responsibility that begins with the owner. </p><p>The National Building Control Management Project (NBCMP) was set up to provide oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of Building Control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities.  Dublin City Council has been approved as the lead building control authority, creating the central and stable executive structure needed to support the local building control function in operating to optimum effect. </p><p>Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, Building Control Authorities have strong powers of inspection, enforcement and prosecution.  Powers in relation to enforcement include the serving of enforcement notices, orders of the courts, and the powers of prosecution.  A person found guilty of an offence under the Act may be liable for fines (up to &euro;50,000) and/or imprisonment (up to 2 years) and be disqualified from signing and submitting certificates of compliance. </p><p>While Building Control Authorities use enforcement mechanisms, including through the courts, to effect compliance where reasonable and appropriate to do so, desired results can also be achieved, and often are, through correspondence, discussion and persuasion, backed up by the potential for legal action in the event that compliance is not forthcoming.</p><p>The Building Control Regulations 1997 require Building Control Authorities to keep a register of, inter alia, any enforcement notices served by them and the date and outcome of any decision of the District Court in respect of an enforcement notice.  The Regulations require that this register shall be available for inspection at the offices of the Building Control Authority during office hours.</p><p>Local authorities are not required to publish material regarding High Court injunctions sought in relation to buildings and works under the Building Control Acts; however, this information is a matter of public record and details of any such cases should be available from the Courts Service of Ireland at <i></i>.</p><p>The Building Control Management System will be developed to facilitate the centralised collection of such data in the future. </p><p>Finally, in relation to CIRI-related legislation, drafting and referral for pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of a Bill were approved by Government on 30 May 2017.  The Bill was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny and my Department is currently working through the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, as the Bill is drafted.  The Department is working with the Attorney General's Office, with a view to achieving publication of the Bill later this year.</p></reply>

Along with promoting and supporting people with disabilities, public bodies are also obliged to meet a 3% target of employees with disabilities.  At the end of 2018, my Department&rsquo;s rate was 5.6%.  The target will increase to 4% in 2020; however, it is anticipated that the rate in my Department will remain above target over the coming years.  There is no obligation to, nor does my Department, collate information specifically on staff with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>My Department has appointed a disability liaison officer, whose role is to provide advice and support to any staff who wish to disclose their disability.  The disability liaison officer is also the first point of contact should staff require additional supports or workplace accommodations.</p><p>In addition, my Department participates in the Willing Able Mentoring Programme (WAM), a project-based work placement which aims to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities.  This programme is a collaboration between the Irish Civil Service and AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability).</p><p>The details requested in relation to bodies under the aegis of my Department are a matter for the individual bodies concerned.

The taking in charge of residential estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the 2000 Act and is a reserved function of the elected members. </p><p>Under Section 180 (1) of the Act, the planning authority is obliged to initiate taking in charge procedures where requested by either the developer or by the majority of owners of the dwellings. However, this is subject to the development being completed to the satisfaction of the authority and in accordance with the permission and any conditions. </p><p>My Department launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure which can include stand-alone treatment plants. Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 14,930 homes. </p><p>Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process were included in a report on the initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018. The report is available at the following link: <i>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf.</i></p><p>The publication of the NTICI report is of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge, including through coordination with capital works by Irish Water. In this regard, my Department is liaising with Irish Water in relation to the report.</p><p>Ultimately, however, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authorities, following the procedures laid out in section 180.</p><p>The National Development Plan, published last year, includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for developer-provided infrastructure, commencing with an estimates provision of &euro;6 million in 2019.  The multi-annual programme will be initiated through the invitation of project bids from local authorities followed by their evaluation by an Expert Panel, set up by my Department, to independently evaluate the bid projects and make recommendations to my Department on suitable projects to be approved for funding.  It is expected that approval of projects for this first cycle multi-annual programme will take place later in Q2 2019.</p></reply>

The programme is being implemented in two phases: Phase 1 provides funding targeted at the less intrusive cavity wall/attic insulation, while Phase 2 focuses on the fabric upgrade works to dwellings with solid/hollow block wall construction and includes the provision of heating upgrades.  Consequently, the amounts allocated annually to local authorities reflect the implementation of the programme

This work has resulted in several publications, most recently "Seabird Populations of Britain and Ireland" (Mitchell et al, 2004), which reported on the survey findings of Seabird 2000. </p>  <p>  The Seabird 2000 project is a partnership between a number of bodies in Ireland and the UK, including the UK Government&rsquo;s conservation agencies, RSPB, the Seabird Group, Shetland Oil Terminal Environmental Advisory Group (SOTEAG), BirdWatch Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </p>  <p>  The survey, largely conducted between 1998 and 2002, showed that the Herring gull population across the island of Ireland experienced a decline of almost 86% when compared with similar survey data from the mid-1980s. Furthermore, the Mitchell et al publication in 2004 stated that the establishment of Herring gull colonies on artificial surfaces, mainly roofs of buildings, had extended the distribution of the species since the first major seabird census conducted during the 1969 and 1970 breeding seasons. However, it was noted that this behaviour was very localised in Ireland and western Scotland. During the reporting period of Seabird 2000, some occurrences of Herring gulls nesting on artificial structures in Dublin were recorded but this were very low in the context of the overall breeding population in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Work is now well underway on the next collaborative seabird census across Ireland and the UK with two further field seasons, this year and in 2020, planned to collect relevant data. The current initiative is called Seabirds Count. </p>  <p>  In support of this, my Department has undertaken a series of surveys over the last four years and will soon be in a position to produce up to date national breeding population estimates for the majority of Ireland&rsquo;s seabirds. A national report is due to be published later this year. The report will also include data from an urban gull survey conducted by Fingal County Council in 2018. </p>  <p>  As the numbers of urban nesting gulls have increased at various locations in Ireland in recent years, it is important to ensure appropriate provision is made to quantify this in proportion to the overall breeding population. Further survey work to target Irish urban gulls is planned for the final year of the Seabirds Count census window in 2020.</p>  <p>  The EU Birds Directive allows Member States to make derogations from its protective measures in respect of certain wild bird species in certain circumstances &ndash; for example, where they are causing damage to crops, livestock and fauna or represent a threat to public health or safety or to air safety. The Declarations to implement these derogations are renewed annually and an annual review of the Declarations is undertaken prior to their expiry. </p>  <p>  My Department completed a review of the derogation process under Article 9 of the EU Birds Directive which took account of all relevant factors, including perceived threats, distribution and population data available in respect of all the bird species in the derogations. ANIAR Ecology was appointed by my Department to undertake the review following a public tendering process.  Their report was published in October 2018 and is available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at www.npws.ie.</p>  <p>  The consultants on their report made a number of recommendations in relation to seagulls including the setting up of a group to agree a programme of action in relation to the seagull situation in the certain urban areas. I have agreed to the formation of a Consultative Committee, with an independent chair, whose membership will include representatives of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, Fingal County Council, local community representatives and a conservation group.  My Department is finalising the composition of the Committee with a view to convening the first meeting of the Committee shortly.</p></reply>

ANIAR Ecology were appointed by my Department to undertake the review following a public tendering process.  While specific professional competencies in relation to a wide range of particular fields were not specified in the tendering process for the review, which was wide ranging and not related to any specific type of bird, the tenderers were required to have knowledge of relevant bird species and an understanding of the effects of bird species on a range of issues including public health and safety. </p><p>The consultant&rsquo;s report was published in October 2018 and is available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department at .</p><p>The consultants in their report made a number of recommendations in relation to seagulls including the setting up of a group to agree a programme of action in relation to the seagull situation in the certain urban areas. In line with the recommendations of the consultants' report I have agreed to the formation of a Consultative Committee, with an independent chair, whose membership will include representatives of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, Fingal County Council, local community representatives and a conservation group.  I understand that arrangements are in hand to convene the first meeting of the Committee shortly after the Easter holiday period. </p><p>The Deputy raises the issue of public health and safety in Section 4.2.1 of the consultant&rsquo;s report.  While my Department is not a national competent authority in relation to public health, it will take account of the advices of relevant authorities as appropriate. The consultants indicate in this section of the report that managing the issues surrounding the impact of seagulls is complex given the longevity of seagulls, the availability of food sources and their resilience and ability to re-nest. Their conclusion is that further research and reviews are required in order to determine effective solutions and the effectiveness of mitigation measures such as removing eggs and nests. The consultants also indicate that there is a need to take account of the unfavourable conservation status of seagulls.  </p><p>The Declarations to implement derogations under the Birds Directive are renewed annually. The 2018/19 Declarations expire on 30 April and I want to assure the Deputy that that there will not be a delay in this process in the context of a 2019/2020 Declaration.</p></reply>
