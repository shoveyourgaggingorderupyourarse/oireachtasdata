Next year, over 20% of the total Education budget or &euro;2bn will be invested in supporting children with special needs.  </p>  <p>  This investment will support the provision of over 1,200 additional special class places. Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including Cork, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to seek to open a special class and there is a range of supports available for schools in terms of funding, specialist advice and professional development.  As Minister, I have powers under Section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort and where all reasonable efforts have failed.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. The NCSE is working with schools, patron bodies, parents and others in Cork to bring the additional special education placements on stream. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that progress has been made with regard to the provision of additional special class places.  However, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special school places in Cork for the current school-year. In this regard, I can confirm that my Department and the NCSE are working with the Patron and management of an existing special school on expanding its provision.</p>  <p>  Planning is also underway to ensure that children in the Cork area are provided with a suitable placement in the next school-year.  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-14a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101400065#WRA01100"><p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.  </p>  <p>  My Department is very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for children with special educational needs and this is reflected in the standard of service provided. In the 2019/2020 school year there were over 14,200 children on Special Educational Needs (SEN) school transport - an increase of 4,982 children since 2013.  My Department funded the School Transport Scheme in 2019 in the amount of just over &euro;219m, with 53% of this having been allocated to spend on the transport scheme for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the SEN Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the scheme children are eligible for transport where they have special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability and are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class/special school or  unit, that is or can be resourced, to meet their special educational needs.    </p>  <p>  Where practicable my Department will consider, the provision of specific or individual transport arrangements in circumstances where travel in the company of other children is not deemed feasible. In addition, there is a facility within the Special Needs Transport Scheme for the appointment of a School Bus Escort where a child&rsquo;s care and safety needs while on school transport are such to require such support.   </p>  <p>  All eligible children are exempt from school transport charges and a Special Transport Grant (STG) towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided at the discretion of the Department in certain situations where for example the child&rsquo;s care or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impracticable.  </p>  <p>  While the closing date for receipt of applications for school transport in general is the last Friday in April in any given year for the following school year, my Department accepts applications all year round for the SEN transport scheme.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am satisfied that school transport provision is adequately provided for all children with disabilities. </p></reply>

The roadmap was developed in line with public health advice provided by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE and follows comprehensive consultation and engagements with education stakeholders.    </p>  <p>  The Government approved a financial package of over &euro;375 million to support the implementation of the roadmap. These comprehensive supports across a range of areas, included funding for getting schools ready, for providing for additional supervision and substitution, and providing additional teachers to help with physical distancing, substitution and class sizes. Funding was also provided for management supports and enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures.</p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the huge contribution made by all Principals, including teaching Principals, most particularly this academic year when Covid-19 has placed an additional strain on Principals and our schools. </p>  <p>  As part of the additional funding &euro;10.2m has been allocated specifically to support Principals and Deputy Principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.  This funding will provide each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week, and release days for Deputy Principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal for this school year.  More than 1,700 primary schools with teaching principals have benefitted from the increase in release days.  </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy has a mainstream staffing of a Principal and 5 mainstream class teachers.  The school had an allocation of 30 Principal Release Days in the 2019/20 school year.  This was increased to 31 as a result of Budget 2020 and further increased to 37 under measures announced in the Roadmap for the Full Return to Schools.  These additional days have been made available to the school referred to by the Deputy this year.</p>  <p>  There are arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.  The school referred to by the Deputy is a base school for such a cluster.</p>  <p>   In addition to the increase of release days, schools have benefited from the lifting of the moratorium on middle management posts.  Since 2017, 1,700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  </p>  <p>  My Department has committed to revising the allocation of posts of responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year. This ensures that the current level of posts of responsibility are maintained in the school system.</p></reply>

A potential preferred site option has been identified. Negotiations with the landowner in respect of this preferred site option to accommodate the school are under way. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, negotiations in respect of site acquisitions are, by their nature, sensitive and for that reason I am not in a position to provide further information at this time. I can assure the Deputy that all parties are working to bring matters to a conclusion at the earliest possible date and Department officials will continue to keep the relevant school authorities appraised of progress. </p></reply>

I would like to assure the Deputy that the acquisition of a new site for the school is a priority for my Department and the patron body will be informed of the location for the school as soon as it is possible to do so. In this regard, the school building project will be progressed into Architectural Planning once a suitable site has been acquired. </p></reply>

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE have published guidance for managing potential cases of COVID-19 in educational settings, which includes the testing strategy within schools. </p>  <p>  All schools were provided with the HSE document titled: &ldquo;Schools Pathway for Covid-19, the Public Health approach&rdquo;, setting out the approach to managing isolated confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the school community, and also the principles that will underpin the management of outbreaks or potential outbreaks and the aligned testing strategy within an educational facility. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked with the HSE Department of Public Health to ensure that testing is prioritised for those close contacts within the school community of confirmed COVID-19 cases. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of COVID-19 in the community or in a school is the responsibility of, and will be led and managed by, Public Health HSE.  All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full Public Health Risk Assessment procedure.  This involves the HSE Department of Public Health liaising directly with the designated school contact, usually the school principal.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the HSE Department of Public Health to ensure that public health measures are acted upon speedily by schools and areas of concerns raised by schools are addressed.</p>  <p>  The key challenge for schools is to work to ensure that the virus is not introduced and that control measures are in place in the event of this happening. My Department has published helpful guidance for the safe and sustainable reopening of schools, in line with public health advice, including guidance on the completion and implementation of a Covid-19 response plan by schools.  These plans set out the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of introduction and transmission of Covid-19 in the school environment and provide for the safe operation of schools.</p>  <p>  Where a Covid 19 infection is confirmed in a school Public Health can recommend a range of actions, such as the exclusion of a pod or class. Where a number of close contacts of a confirmed case are recommended to be tested for Covid 19 those swabs are treated as a batch. This allows all contacts in a school to receive their results quickly and efficiently. </p></reply>

For the 2021/22 school year the staffing schedule will be on the basis of 1 teacher to 25 pupils.</p><p>The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2019/20 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes.</p><p>The staffing schedule which now stands at a new historical low of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that one less pupil is required to retain or recruit a teacher.</p><p>The new staffing schedule for 2021/22, taking account of the recent budget measure will be published early next year and at that stage, schools will be able to establish what their staffing arrangement are for the following school year. </p></reply>

As a result, on the foot of his determinations on the specific applications before him, payments are being made to a number of victims of child sexual abuse in day schools.

To date, 15 offers have been accepted.  </p>  <p>  Following the determinations by the Independent Assessor, my Department announced a review of the scheme.     </p>  <p>  The review of the scheme is on-going.

In this year's budget, more than 20% of the total Education Budget or &euro;2bn will be invested in supporting children with special needs, an increase from &euro;1.9bn last year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. While progress has been achieved, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special class and special school places in South Dublin for the current school-year. </p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to provide new special class or special school places.  </p>  <p>  As Minister, I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. </p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  A Report from the NCSE, prepared in accordance with Section 37A (2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), confirming the need for additional special education places in South Dublin was submitted to the then Minister in April last. This Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Statutory notices under the Act were subsequently issued on 26 June, 2020 to 39 schools identified by the NCSE. The issue of the notices is but the first step in a very transparent multi-step process, the purpose of which is to establish if the school has capacity to provide new places. At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration at a later point. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The representations received to date have all been published and are a matter of public record.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage on the legislative process which is currently underway.</p></reply>

The statistical model itself was developed specifically for the Irish Leaving Certificate.  </p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the Calculated Grades results and are available at the following link   </p><p>The design of the Calculated Grades model was informed by advice from a Technical Working Group comprising experts drawn from the State Examinations Commission, the Inspectorate of my Department, the Educational Research Centre, and international external expertise.</p><p>The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  </p><p>The Department had checks at a number of stages to ensure that data was collected correctly from schools and transferred correctly between the various stages of the standardisation process, the validation process and the grading processes.  </p><p>In order to make sure that the standardisation process was doing what it was supposed to do, a separate additional process was carried out called validation.</p><p>Validation is an inherent element of any statistical system, and in the Calculated Grades model the purpose of validation is to ensure that the statistical model is behaving as expected, and is achieving its objectives. The validation process has been part of the design from the beginning.</p><p>The workings of the statistical model were reviewed and validated in a number of ways. There was a review of the distributions of results for each subject and level. There was also a review of the demographic characteristics of the outcomes, which included gender and socio-economic status of the school.</p><p>The purpose of the review of the outcomes of the statistical model was to check whether the Calculated Grades model was resulting in any particular group being advantaged or disadvantaged relative to previous years&rsquo; outcomes. It is important to note that this assessment was being made relative to previous years. For example, the validation checked whether or not disadvantage effects, or gender effects are being exacerbated under the model. This was to ensure that the model presented outcomes that were as fair and equitable as possible given its constraints, and were in line with previous outcomes as much as is possible.</p><p>The purpose of the Calculated Grades system is to arrive at the grade that each student would have achieved if the examinations had taken place as normal. The validation process checked whether the interactions between these characteristics and the calculated results were similar to the interactions in the historical data between these characteristics and examination results.</p><p>I regret that a number of coding errors were found in the Calculated Grades process. These errors, which related to the processing of Junior Cycle data, required the process to be run again, resulting in improved Calculated Grades being provided to some students on 3 October. I announced on that date that I had asked that a comprehensive independent review of the design and implementation of the Calculated Grades process should take place when the process is complete. The full scope of that review will be clearly set out in advance.</p></reply>

The School Authority has recently agreed to a proposed project brief, which includes specialist teaching accommodation, but does not include a new Physical Education (PE) Hall, as this does not fall under the remit of the ASA scheme.  </p>  <p>  The School Authority has applied separately for major capital funding for a PE Hall.  As the Deputy is aware, the provision of PE Halls form part of the accommodation brief for all newly established schools.  These facilities may also form part of the overall accommodation brief for major capital extensions to existing schools.  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly.</p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics.  The second half of the NDP (from 2023 onwards) will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.  This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. </p>  <p>  The immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. The Department has also been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the logistics involved with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, aligned to the public health advice received shortly before schools reopened which advised that the post-primary scheme should run at 50% capacity.</p>  <p>  The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of weeks, while Bus &Eacute;ireann has been carrying out a detailed analysis of the resources required to fully implement the advice on all routes.  Over the coming weeks, Bus &Eacute;ireann will be implementing 50% capacity on a rolling basis as soon as it is possible to do so on each individual route. </p>  <p>  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children.  As well as additional funding, significant numbers of additional vehicles, drivers and bus escorts will be required.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is implementing different means of providing extra capacity with existing operators, including upgrading vehicles, additional runs or additional vehicles being provided.  Where additional services will need to be procured, Bus &Eacute;ireann has put in place a framework of operators that are willing to provide additional services where required.  </p>  <p>  An analysis has been conducted to determine what is required to fully implement all post-primary school services to operate at 50% capacity.  The estimated full year cost to operate all services at 50% capacity is between &euro;87m and &euro;135m with an estimated requirement for an additional 1,600 drivers and vehicles and 650 additional School Bus Escorts. </p>  <p>  Further detailed planning is being done through the local offices on a route by route basis to plan appropriate measures to provide the additional capacity required.  As the additional capacity is rolled out, where spare capacity is created, further tickets will be allocated  to those children eligible for the scheme who have paid late and for other applicants seeking concessionary tickets.</p></reply>

The Leaving Certificate results of these students will remain unchanged as they do every year in these circumstances. </p><p>There has been an increase in the numbers of available places in colleges so that improved CAO offers can be made to all candidates who would have been entitled to them.

This will mean an overall increase in the numbers of students in third-level education and will lessen any risk of candidates not being able to participate in third-level education. </p><p>I also announced on 3 October that I had asked that a comprehensive independent review of the design and implementation of the Calculated Grades process should take place when the process is complete.

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.</p>  <p>  Based on the public health advice published in early July, my Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place. The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. </p>  <p>  The Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, in order to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. </p>  <p>  Commercial contractors who provide transport for schools on a private hire or commercial basis but who are not contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate on the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme do not fall under the remit of the Department of Education. However, the Department has reminded schools and other stakeholders that public health advice is best practice on these services also.</p></reply>

The Strategy recognises that schools require investment in their ICT infrastructure. Funding of &euro;210m has been committed to support the implementation of this strategy with &euro;110m issued over the last three years and a further &euro;50m has recently been issued in respect of the 2019-2020 school year. The remaining &euro;50m under this provision will issue to schools during the current school year (2020-2021).</p>  <p>  In the context of the current public health crisis the funding can be focussed on assisting schools to address ICT needs including devices, software and infrastructural solutions to support the provision of remote learning, include the purchase of digital devices that can be shared with students who do not have access to devices.</p>  <p>  Schools have been advised of direct drawdown mechanisms for the purchase of laptops. HEAnet operates an aggregated order process on its Single Provider Framework with Dell, while Datapac also do so through a Single Provider Framework with HP. Both of these Frameworks have been established from the OGP Framework of Providers of Laptops. This was intended to enable laptop orders from schools to be prioritised, during the current public health crisis. Schools are responsible for the procurement of any such equipment in accordance with relevant procurement requirements and according to their own needs.</p>  <p>  Schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on their own context and circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of Laptops and tablets in schools. The information on their website outlines what these devices can offer schools to support teaching, learning and assessment, and facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration including software and hardware requirements, purchasing regulations, are addressed in the support information. </p></reply>

These engagements will continue to help address any issues that arise in schools in the context of COVID-19.   </p>  <p>  Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan which outlines the measures for the safe operation of the school through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice.

The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. It will run for the period of one year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.  This pilot will provide an additional &euro;64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per student enrolled in the school.  This additional funding issued to schools in May 2020.</p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Circa. 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes.

In this year's budget, more than 20% of the total Education Budget or &euro;2bn will be invested in supporting children with special needs, an increase from &euro;1.9bn last year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. While progress has been achieved, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special class and special school places in South Dublin for the current school-year. </p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to provide new special class or special school places.  </p>  <p>  As Minister, I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. </p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  A Report from the NCSE, prepared in accordance with Section 37A (2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), confirming the need for additional special education places in South Dublin was submitted to the then Minister in April last. This Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Statutory notices under the Act were subsequently issued on 26 June, 2020 to 39 schools identified by the NCSE. The issue of the notices is but the first step in a very transparent multi-step process, the purpose of which is to establish if the school has capacity to provide new places. At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration at a later point. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The representations received to date have all been published and are a matter of public record.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage on the legislative process which is currently underway.</p></reply>

Riverstown_Glanmire is one such school planning area.</p><p>Included in the data considered is information provided by local authorities in respect of residential development activity in each area, in order to anticipate emerging school place requirements from any planned additional population.</p><p>Where data indicates that enrolments in a school planning area are expected to increase, my Department determines the optimum solution for accommodating the anticipated school place requirements after consideration of the following options:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, </p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools, </p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review and my Department is currently working on an updated exercise to assess needs for the coming years, including those which may arise in Riverstown_Glanmire. This work is at an advanced stage.</p><p>Where a school authority feels there is a deficit of teaching accommodation in a school, it is open to it to make an application through the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme, details of which are available at www.education.ie.

Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan in place.  </p><p>Covid-19 response plans are the means through which schools can best prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 in the school environment.  Covid-19 response plans set out the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of introduction and transmission of Covid-19 in the school environment and provide for the safe operation of schools.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE have published guidance for managing potential cases of COVID-19 in educational settings, which includes the testing strategy within an educational facility &lsquo;Schools Pathway for COVID-19, the Public Health approach&rsquo;:</p><p> </p><p>This guidance provides that the HSE Department of Public Health will liaise directly with schools regarding any actions to be taken following a Public Health Risk Assessment. In practice, this involves the HSE Department of Public Health liaising directly with the designated contact, usually the school principal of the public health instructions. These instructions are for implementation of public health measures required under Infectious Diseases legislation. </p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has considered the national experience of school reopening to date, including the epidemiological data and information gathered through case and outbreak management.  The experience to date since schools reopened is reassuring and supports the current international position that schools and childcare facilities do not appear to be key drivers of COVID-19 transmission in the community.  It is clear that the exceptional efforts of school staff, children and parents/guardians in implementing the public health  guidance has contributed to the safe and successful reopening of schools in Ireland.  </p><p>My Department has also recently published detailed FAQs for school principals in relation to the COVID-19 Testing Pathway for school communities. These FAQs will greatly assist principals to understand and manage situations as they arise in their schools and they include HSE contact details, including for out of hours for any queries that the FAQs do not address.  </p></reply>

The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of weeks, while Bus &Eacute;ireann has been carrying out a detailed analysis of the resources required to fully implement the advice on all routes.  Over the coming weeks, Bus Eireann will be implementing 50% capacity on a rolling basis as soon as it is possible to do so on each individual route. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education and Skills have supported all bus contractors to put in place measures to support infection prevention and control on the buses.  The Department has also issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. Measures include all post-primary students wearing masks, all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses.  Seating plans with pre-assigned seating are in place on all routes, with children sitting next to their siblings or classmates where possible. This reduces the interaction of children on the buses with those outside of their family, class or school. </p>  <p>  Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure that full implementation of the public health recommendation of running buses for post-primary children is achieved as quickly as possible on the post-primary scheme and on the special educational needs scheme for post-primary children.  As well as additional funding, significant numbers of additional vehicles, drivers and bus escorts will be required.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is implementing different means of providing extra capacity with existing operators, including upgrading vehicles, additional runs or additional vehicles being provided.  Where additional services will need to be procured, Bus &Eacute;ireann has put in place a framework of operators that are willing to provide additional services where required.  </p>  <p>   An analysis has been conducted to determine what is required to fully implement all post-primary school services to operate at 50% capacity.   The estimated full year cost to operate all services at 50% capacity is between &euro;87m and &euro;135m with an estimated requirement for an additional 1,600 drivers and vehicles and 650 additional School Bus Escorts. </p>  <p>  Further detailed planning is being done through the local offices on a route by route basis to plan appropriate measures to provide the additional capacity required.  As the additional capacity is rolled out, where spare capacity is created, further tickets will be allocated  to those children eligible for the scheme who have paid late and for other applicants seeking concessionary tickets.</p></reply>

The Review made a number of recommendations including the need for a national training programme for SNAs currently employed in our schools. </p>  <p>  Following consideration of the recommendation including engagement with stakeholders, it was decided that a training and professional framework for SNAs should be developed.  As a first step, it was decided that a once off unaccredited programme was required to help ensure SNAs currently working in our schools have a shared understanding of their role and way of working with children with the complex care needs. </p>  <p>  Following a public procurement process, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education was awarded the contract for the development and delivery of the once off programme. UCD&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience and expertise in education and training will help ensure the programme is of high quality, evidence based and relevant to the SNA role. </p>  <p>  The programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. For some SNAs, this programme may present the first opportunity in recent times for them to engage with the theory and research based best practice underlying their role in a professional and supported environment. Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  The online programme consists of five modules delivered over a ten-month period covering inclusion, communications and language, a range of special needs and information on caring for students with additional care needs. In total, there are 3,500 places available on the programme over the next four years. </p>  <p>  This programme will begin in January 2021 with 500 participants in the first year. Priority is being given to SNAs working in School Inclusion Pilot Schools. Over 4,000 expression of interests have been received to date.</p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education.  </p>  <p>  There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p>  <p>  On 30 September, I made a statement advising that two errors had been identified in the Calculated Grades process. These meant that incorrect grades were issued to some students when they received their results on 7 September. </p>  <p>  The first error, in one out of 50,000 lines of code, was in relation to the processing of Junior Cycle data. The system was meant to draw on the core Junior Cycle subjects of English, Irish and Maths, and combine them with the students&rsquo; 2 best non-core subjects for all of the students in each class in each school. The coding error instead combined the core subjects with the students&rsquo; 2 weakest non-core subjects.</p>  <p>  The error meant that, in some subjects, some students received Calculated Grades that were lower than they should have been, while some students received grades that were higher than they should have been. </p>  <p>  In the course of a review which the Department then undertook, Departmental staff found a further error in the section of the code dealing with Junior Cycle results. The Junior Cycle subject Civil, Social and Political Education (CSPE) was meant to be disregarded as part of the model but was not. This second error, however, had a negligible impact on results.</p>  <p>  At that stage I decided to seek independent expert oversight in the interest of certainty, particularly for our students. I commissioned Education Testing Services (ETS), a non-profit organisation based in the United States, to provide an independent expert opinion on the coding.</p>  <p>  I provided a further update on 03 October, announcing that improved Calculated Grades would issue to impacted students that day. This announcement was made following a review of essential aspects of the coding by ETS. </p>  <p>  ETS completed their review and provided it to my Department on 3 October.  The review identified one further error, relating to how the code handled cases where students did not sit all three core subjects (Irish, English and Maths) at Junior Cycle level.  </p>  <p>  ETS also identified an issue concerning how the algorithm used in the standardisation process treated students&rsquo; marks at the extreme ends of the marks scale (99% and over, 1% and below). However, ETS also stated that this had no material impact on the results and no student could receive a lower grade as a result of it. </p>  <p>  A copy of the report submitted by ETS is available on www.gov.ie/leavngcert.</p>  <p>  I also announced on 3 October that I had asked that a comprehensive independent review of the design and implementation of the Calculated Grades process should take place when the process is complete.  </p>  <p>  The full scope of this review will be clearly set out in advance.  </p></reply>

Detailed information regarding the arrangements for these examinations can be found on the website of the State Examinations Commission at .</p><p>The State Examinations Commission (SEC) will operate the examinations in line with public health guidelines at the time. In line with current policy, candidates will not be able to attend at school to sit these examinations if they are suffering from COVID-19, have symptoms of the virus or are required to self-isolate or restrict their movements due to the virus. </p><p>Following the closure of schools in March 2020, the Department published a range of guidance to assist schools and teachers in ensuring continuity of teaching and learning for students, as well as supporting their wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p><p>This guidance aimed to ensure regular engagement of students in lessons, tasks and learning experiences across the range of curriculum subjects, provision of regular assignments and regular, practical, supportive and customised feedback on work submitted.  Schools engaged with their students in various ways, in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at home.</p><p>The aim of the remote learning approaches adopted by schools, the guidance that was issued to all schools, and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of the school closures and to enable students to complete the curriculum before tuition ceased on 11 May.</p><p>Students choosing to sit the postponed examinations will have additional time to prepare for examination and, if they choose, may opt to sit less than the full suite of examinations. </p><p>Candidates for postponed examinations are no longer students in schools and the school which they attended will be fully engaged with 6th year students who will be preparing for examinations in 2021, as well as full cohorts of students in every other year. </p><p>Candidates who have been approved by the State Examinations Commission for the use of reasonable accommodation(s) for the June examinations will have access to these accommodation(s) in November. </p><p>These measures include alternative scheduling of an examination(s) (e.g. to facilitate medical treatment) provided such was possible within the confines of the day/evening of the examination.  This could involve either early or late examinations sittings requiring candidates to be supervised so that they did not have access to other candidates who had already sat or who have yet to sit the examinations in question, though noting that this facility will be quite limited in November as the examinations take place during the normal school year. Candidates can also have access to a special examination centre and the provision of rest breaks during the examinations.</p><p>It is not possible to approve new applications for reasonable accommodation in any other circumstances, other than the normal emergency application process which applies each year.  </p><p>It is highly unlikely that it will be possible to facilitate sitting examinations in hospital settings in November due to HSE restrictions on access to hospitals as a consequence of COVID-19.</p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.   In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November. </p></reply>

Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan in place.  Covid-19 response plans are the means through which schools can best prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 in the school environment.  Covid-19 response plans set out the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of introduction and transmission of Covid-19 in the school environment and provide for the safe operation of schools.</p><p>An employee in the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group who is not ill must attend the workplace. In accordance with HSE advice, the employee in the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group should take extra care to practice social distancing and hand hygiene.  The Covid 19 response plan outlines the arrangements in place to ensure a safe workplace for all employees.  Those deemed &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;normal risk&rsquo; can attend the workplace safely where the school is implementing the Covid-19 Response Plan and the health advice for schools. </p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre and the HSE have published guidance for managing potential cases of COVID-19 in educational settings, which includes the testing strategy within an educational facility &lsquo;Schools Pathway for COVID-19, the Public Health approach&rsquo;:</p><p> </p><p>This guidance provides that the HSE Department of Public Health will liaise directly with schools regarding any actions to be taken following a Public Health Risk Assessment. In practice, this involves the HSE Department of Public Health liaising directly with the designated contact, usually the school principal of the public health instructions. The risk assessment includes HSE advice and guidance on communication to pupils and staff in the event of a confirmed case in the school.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has considered the national experience of school reopening to date, including the epidemiological data and information gathered through case and outbreak management.  The experience to date since schools reopened is reassuring and supports the current international position that schools and childcare facilities do not appear to be key drivers of COVID-19 transmission in the community.  It is clear that the exceptional efforts of school staff, children and parents/guardians in implementing the public health  guidance has contributed to the safe and successful reopening of schools in Ireland.  </p><p>My Department has also recently published detailed FAQs for school principals in relation to the COVID-19 Testing Pathway for school communities. These FAQs will greatly assist principals to understand and manage situations as they arise in their schools and they include HSE contact details, including for out of hours for any queries that the FAQs do not address.  </p></reply>

I was delighted to build further on this progress by announcing a further 1 point reduction in yesterday&rsquo;s budget.   </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for the next academic year (2021/22) now stands at 1 teacher for every 25 pupils.

Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts. Other P.E. facilities e.g. pitches are provided, where appropriate and in the context of available resources and site conditions, under my Department&rsquo;s school building programme to be delivered as part of the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  Many schools have a general purpose room/sports hall and practically all schools have outdoor play areas.  In addition, many schools, use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools. However, local circumstances due to Covid may have limited schools access to some of these facilities.</p>  <p>  Under the July Stimulus Programme, my Department secured a &euro;375m support package to enable the safe return for schools.  This included additional funding of &euro;75m which was allocated to cover an enhanced Minor Works Grant at primary level and a once off Minor Works Grant at post-primary level (paid automatically to schools in the free scheme and on application basis to schools in fee-charging sector).  </p>  <p>  There was &euro;42m allocated to Post Primary schools and &euro;30m allocated to primary schools.  In addition, due to the exceptional circumstances arising from COVID-19, the &euro;29m Minor Works Grant (MWG) that is generally paid to primary schools in either December or January of each school year was paid under the Minor Works Grant to primary schools in July 2020.</p>  <p>  The main focus of minor works funding in 2020 was on creating extra space for classes within existing school buildings and this was very successfully done in a short period of time to enable physical distancing arrangements to be put in place.  This operated on a local devolved basis and involved a variety of solutions being put in place at individual school level.</p></reply>

These initiatives are overseen by Department Steering Groups and the design process for materials produced by the support services involves input from members of my Departments Inspectorate and relevant stakeholders such as the NCCA and the State Exams Commission. </p>  <p>  In 2019, my Department commissioned a project to develop a research based framework for the evaluation of Teachers&rsquo; Professional Learning (TPL) and for the piloting of this framework in the area of TPL activities for student wellbeing. </p>  <p>  The Educational Research Centre is carrying out this 3 year research project and my Department has established a Steering Committee to oversee the research. The Steering Committee is comprised of representatives from relevant sections of my Department, the teacher education support services, NEPS, NCSE, Education Support Centres Ireland, Educational Research Centre, Teaching Council, ETBI, HSE and SOLAS.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the evaluation framework will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of teachers&rsquo; professional learning activities in order to ensure that this provision meets the needs of teachers, schools, students and my Department efficiently and effectively and to ensure the best use of available resources. </p>  <p>  In the interim, the Teacher Education support services use a variety of research instruments to evaluate professional development provision. These instruments comprise a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods recognised in the field of teacher education. </p>  <p>  An independent evaluation of the work of the Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is currently underway with the evaluation report due in Q4 2020. My Department is also working with Education Centres to implement Key Performance Indicators to monitor their performance in relation to the provision of CPD to teachers. The Summer Course Programmes are quality assured by the Inspectorate to ensure that they reflect curricular change and national priorities. </p>  <p>  In recent months the demand for support has been unprecedented as the Support Services responded to the urgent and critical need to develop resources to meet the needs of schools during Covid-19 closures, particularly in the area of on-line teaching and learning. </p></reply>

Each school is also required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection.</p>  <p>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria and the Primary Staffing Appeals Board are currently accepting staffing appeals from schools. As part of the appeal process the Appeals Board will consider appeals where schools clearly demonstrate how their enrolments were negatively impacted by COVID-19. </p></reply>

To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. In 2019, &euro;39.8 million was allocated to the Scheme with over 3,000 homes upgraded.  Budget 2020 announced a budget allocation for the scheme of &euro;52.8 million.  This represents the biggest ever budget for the Warmer Homes Scheme. </p><p>Earlier this year, in line with public health and Government guidelines in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, all works under SEAI funded schemes were advised to pause for a period of time. On June 29th, and again on July 20th, SEAI advised that works in homes that could be classified as lower risk under the scheme could resume, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for reopening society and business and Return to work safely protocol. The aim at all times was to minimise the risks for the homeowners and property occupants, contractors, their employees and the wider community.</p><p>On October 8th SEAI issued updated guidance for contractors working on the Warmer Homes Scheme and the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme. This guidance is informed by the Government's <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>. It also takes into consideration the inherent vulnerability of energy poor homes and their occupants, in particular the impacts of inadequate heat on health, wellbeing and general quality of life.</p><p>SEAI have advised that retrofit works may proceed where a contractor has fully assessed the risks and is fully satisfied that they can complete the works while complying with the guidelines set out in the Return to Work Safely Protocol. Contractors providing works under the scheme  are responsible for undertaking a thorough risk assessment in order to minimise the risks for themselves, their employees, the property occupants and the wider community.  The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for monitoring to ensure that workplaces comply with the National Protocol.</p><p>SEAI also state that prior to commencing, and throughout each upgrade, all public health guidelines must be considered when assessing employee, homeowner and occupant risks, within the working environment. Also, prior to commencing any home visit or works, contractors must secure any relevant consents and confirmations in writing from homeowners and property occupants.</p><p>The full guidance from SEAI can be found at </p></reply>

It is widely expected that, over the next number of years, the combination of improvements in technology, reductions in vehicle purchase prices, increasing driving ranges and model availabilities, coupled with Government incentives and new investment in the recharging network will maintain the current positive policy environment under which electric vehicle sales have risen steeply in recent years. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 23,500 electric vehicles currently under taxation in Ireland. At the end of 2017, there was under 3,800 electric vehicles in Ireland.  This increase represents a six-fold increase over 3 years. Furthermore, though the registration of new cars has fallen this year compared to 2019, the number of new electric vehicles purchased so far this year is already ahead of the number of new electric vehicles purchased last year.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to supporting the roll out of EVs so as to ensure we meet our ambitious commitments as set out in the Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan. In this regard, following yesterday's Budget, I expect to allocate &euro;36.5 million next year, including a &euro;9.5m contribution from the Carbon Tax, to further enable the roll out of electric vehicles and related charging infrastructure. In addition to the continuation of vehicle grants and home and public charging, the SEAI will also be introducing new and additional support measures for destination chargers for locations such as hotels, shopping centres or places of employment. A new EV marketing campaign will be launched by the SEAI to assist citizens in making informed choices on the environmental and economic benefits of driving an electric vehicle.</p>  <p>  In addition, under Budget 2021, &euro;15 million has been earmarked by the Department of Transport to support taxi and hackney drivers in scrapping their older vehicles and replacing them with electric alternatives. The scrappage scheme will be open for taxis and hackneys reaching their maximum permissible age limit in 2020/21. Details of the scheme will be released shortly. </p></reply>

The Climate Action Fund will be resourced from proceeds from the levy paid to the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) in respect of relevant disposals of petroleum products, after the funding requirements of NORA have been met. In the region of &euro;500 million is expected to accrue to the Climate Action Fund to 2027 as a result of this legislative change.

The scope of the call, and associated criteria and terms and conditions, are being finalised. The design of this call is being informed by information gathered in the &ldquo;Expression of Interest&rdquo; process earlier this year and from lessons learned from the first call. My Department is seeking to offer greater clarity and support to potential applicants aimed at increasing the number of successful bids and the quality of the applications that may be supported in the next round. To assist in this regard, my Department will engage further with interested parties, through our website, as part of the next funding call.  </p></reply>

Therefore, initially those who are frontline healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot.

I do not believe that it is a suitable vehicle for broader application beyond its original policy goal. A large scale extension of Living City, as proposed, would amount to s. 23 type relief. These types of reliefs were, with good reason, ended a decade ago. In any event, the proposal would have the potential for greatly increased Exchequer costs and would raise state aid concerns. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in this sectors strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance. </p></reply>

At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.   </p>  <p>  A number of new flexibilities have been included in the EWSS, while the rates and eligibility criteria have been modified so that the support is sustainable into the more medium term.  In that regard, I would note that the level of subsidy being granted under the EWSS is commensurate with the average payment per worker under the TWSS which had been reducing since the start of June and when the TWSS ceased at the end of August was &euro;282 across all recipients and &euro;225 in the case of first-time recipients.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that the adaptation from the TWSS to the levels of support in the EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of up to 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.</p></reply>

However, each financial institution has different procedures for opening an account.  Some providers require that a parent or guardian sign the account opening form if the applicant is under 16 years of age. Other providers only require parental permission if the applicant is under 13 years of age. </p><p>To open an account for a child under 7 you will usually have to open it in the name of the adult, with child&rsquo;s name noted. For children between 7 and 12 you will typically have three options &ndash; it can be: a) in the name of the adult, with child&rsquo;s name noted, b) in the name of both the adult and the child, c) in the name of the child only. In all cases, the institution is required to comply with EU rules on money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Credit unions in Ireland are regulated and supervised under the Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and regulations issued by the Central Bank. The Act and regulations set out the services that credit unions may provide to their members which includes savings, loans, prescribed services and other additional services where approval has been given by the Central Bank. </p><p>Section 17 of the 1997 Act sets out the requirements of, and qualifications for, membership of a credit union.  Section 17(5) states the following:</p><p><i>Subject to any provision to the contrary in the rules of a credit union, a person under the age of sixteen&mdash;</i></p><p><i>(a) may be a member of the credit union, and</i></p><p><i>(b) subject to subsection (6), may enjoy all the rights of membership, other than voting rights, and can give all necessary receipts.</i></p><p>All credit unions must have a set of registered rules which bind all members. The Irish League of Credit Unions provides a set of &lsquo;standard rules&rsquo; which many credit unions adopt. Rule 14 of these standard rules states that <i>&ldquo;Where the member under age sixteen cannot give the necessary receipts, the signature of the parent or guardian, at the discretion of the board of directors, will be sufficient&rdquo;.</i></p><p>Accordingly, in practice the signature of the parent or guardian may be used in certain circumstances.</p></reply>

However, the 'Tutty Report' on PCPs (available at: ) recommended that further consumer protections in relation to PCP agreements should be introduced; in particular, it recommended that the provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code which require lenders to assess the suitability of the product for the consumer and also the ability of the borrower to repay the debt over the duration of the credit agreement, should be extended to hire-purchase/PCP agreements.  This will require legislation and the Minister has obtained Government approval to draft a Bill (see relevant press release attached: ) and it is the intention of Government to publish this Bill as soon as possible.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that consumers can refer complaints relating to PCP/ hire purchase providers to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. </p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer motor insurance cover and what terms to apply.  For example, factors may include the drivers age; relevant driving experience; the age and type of vehicle; how and where the vehicle is used; the claims record; the number of drivers; the storage location; and the use of telematics. Insurers also price quotations in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. In the case of taxi drivers, I understand that insurers take into account the nature of the taxi business, which involves driving for hire or reward extensively and in their view this has a much higher risk of injury claims from passengers and other road-users as a result.  Accordingly, premium prices vary across the market, demonstrating why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.  It is also my understanding that the number of underwriters providing cover in the taxi market in Ireland has increased in recent years and therefore there are more competitive offerings to the taxi community. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy in relation to the precise query asked, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in Ireland.  They stated that if on occasion a taxi operator is encountering difficulties securing a quotation, the Insurance Ireland information service is available at feedback@insuranceireland.eu to policy holders or those seeking motor insurance.  They also stated that if a policyholder was to encounter this issue with their insurance provider, the Declined Cases Agreement would come into force.  They believe that this process will facilitate a quotation to be released for the nominated driver, with the consent of the policyholder.  In that regard, the email address for such queries is declined@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

This applied to auto fuels from midnight last night.  I have delayed the increase on all other fuels, including green diesel, to 1st May 2021.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, those who are eligible to purchase green diesel already benefit from a much lower overall rate of excise compared to that applied to auto diesel, with the non carbon component set at a very low 4.7 cent per litre compared to 42.6 cents per litre for the non carbon component of auto diesel excise.   </p>  <p>  Farmers and agricultural contractors who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of their trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for those expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel. </p>  <p>  When my predecessor increased Carbon Tax in Budget 2012 he made provision for a double income tax relief for farmers to compensate for the increase. This relief continues to apply. </p></reply>

Measures introduced by the Government to date have benefitted the sport sector including the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the series of enterprise supports.</p>  <p>  There has been extensive engagement with the sport sector over the past number of months which has highlighted the significant, adverse impact of COVID-19 at all levels of the Irish sporting landscape.  A COVID-19 Sports Monitoring Group, chaired at Ministerial level, has been established to engage directly with the sporting bodies. An Expert Group on Return to Sport, chaired by an official of my Department, has also been established to provide advice and guidance to sporting bodies. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is also directly engaging with the sporting bodies on an ongoing basis.   </p>  <p>  A funding package of up to &euro;70 million has been put in place to support the sector. The funding package, which will be administered by Sport Ireland,includes;</p>  <p>-  Funding of up to &euro;40m for the three main field sports organisations &ndash; the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU. </p>  <p>-  a Resilience Fund of up to &euro;10m to support the National Governing Bodies of Sport,</p>  <p>-  a  Sports Club Resilience Fund of up to &euro;15m to support clubs, and</p>  <p>-  a Sports  Restart and Renewal Fund of up to &euro;5m. </p>  <p>  The funding will be invested through new grant schemes with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s recognised funding partners, including the National Governing Bodies of Sport, Local Sports Partnerships and other funded sporting organisations.</p>  <p>  The closing date for applications to Sport Ireland under the COVID 19 grant schemes was September 14. I understand that a large number of applications was received. 39 National Governing Bodies applied on their own behalf or on behalf of their member clubs. Sport Ireland is currently processing and validating the applications. There is significant interest in each of the 4 strands of funding. The process will be complete by the end of October and an announcement on allocations will be made at that time.</p>  <p>  In addition to this funding scheme, I announced a special fund of &euro;2.5 million as part of the July Jobs Stimulus to support the reopening of publicly accessible swimming pools in recognition of the particular challenges pool operators face in reopening to the public. This funding will also be administered by Sport Ireland. Sport Ireland is currently finalising the grant scheme. Full details of the scheme and the application process will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to welcome an increase of &euro;36 million in funding for Sport Ireland in the 2021 Estimates. This funding will ensure continued support for the sport sector over the coming year, including support for Team Ireland athletes preparing for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. Dormant Accounts Funding for Sport Ireland programmes has also been increased from &euro;8 million in 2020 to &euro;10 million next year. This funding will support programmes aiming to increase participation in sport and physical activity by people with disabilities and disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  In relation to women&rsquo;s sport, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to women's sport over many years, and considerable Exchequer funding has been allocated to programmes aimed at encouraging women's active and social participation in sport. This will also be the case in 2021.  I would highlight in this regard the Sport Ireland Women in Sport programme established in 2005, which has provided funding support to a broad range of programmes aimed at increasing participation by women and girls. Minister Chambers has already been in discussions on how the Government can do more to support this initiative. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the importance of women's sport is something I will be highlighting in all my contacts with national and international sporting bodies.</p></reply>

Further orders were signed on 16 April 2020 and 9 May 2020, the last of which expired on 23 May 2020. The three Orders had the combined effect of extending the relevant planning periods and timelines, including the duration of planning permissions, by an aggregate of 56 days/8 weeks during the time period in which they have effect. Accordingly, on foot of these Orders, the validity of a planning permission has now been extended by a further 8 weeks. </p>  <p>  Under section 42 of the Act, the holder of planning permission may apply to the planning authority for an extension to the period of permission, prior to the expiration of that permission. On application, the authority shall extend the appropriate period by such additional period not exceeding 5 years as the authority considers requisite to enable the development to which the permission relates to be completed, provided that, the development was commenced before the expiration of the permission, substantial works were carried out and the development will be completed within a reasonable time. </p>  <p>  Provision is also made under section 42 to enable planning authorities to grant an extension to permission for instances were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission.</p>  <p>  If an extension to planning permission has been previously granted, the only circumstance in which the holder of a planning permission may be granted a second extension of duration is in respect of a development that relates to 20 or more houses subject to the development being completed within 5 years of the originally extended permission or by 31 December 2021, whichever first occurs.</p>  <p>  On 15 September 2020, the Government published its latest response to managing Covid-19 - Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for living with Covid-19.  While I do not envisage any further actions will be required for the planning system in the context of this framework at this time, I continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The oversight and management of the lists of qualified households awaiting accommodation, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with Sections 20 and 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment and Allocation Regulations, respectively. Under Regulation 28 of the Assessment Regulations, a household&rsquo;s qualification for support may be reviewed at the discretion of a local authority and Regulation 29 provides that the household&rsquo;s qualification for support shall be reassessed at the point of allocation of support.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.

No Corncrake have been recorded on Inishturbot in the years 2018 to 2020, but the island habitat is suitable for Corncrake and other ground nesting birds, such as Skylark. </p>  <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department recently secured EU LIFE funding for a five year project, LIFE Atlantic Crex, which focuses on improving the conservation status of Corncrake in Ireland. The project will work with a range of local stakeholders across the Corncrake SPA network and will undertake predation risk management at all of the project sites. Inishturbot in Co. Galway is a target area for habitat enhancement for Corncrake as part of the project. Predation risk management would include an investigation of any rat populations which may pose a threat to ground nesting birds- in particular Corncrake. </p></reply>

Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools.</p>  <p>  Previous budgets of 2016 and 2018 improved the staffing schedule by one point on both occasions to its historically lowest level ever of 1 teacher to 26 pupils. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  </p>  <p>  I am delighted to build further on this progress by announcing a further 1 point reduction in Budget 2021.  </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for the 2021/22 academic year now stands at 1 teacher for every 25 pupils. This measure will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that  less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.   </p>  <p>  Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the 2019/20 school year and this has led to a steady improvement in the pupil teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period. </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2019/20 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes.</p></reply>

It is crucial that we support the wellbeing of our students and school management and staff in order to support successful re-engagement with teaching and learning.  We know that most students, and indeed their families and school staff were looking forward to going back, reconnecting with school, reconnecting with staff and friends and settling back into school work. This has been a time of change, with new rules and routines to be learned, in order to keep everyone safe. Some students may have felt anxious about the return to school. In times of change some worry or anxiety is a normal response. Most by now will have settled and re-engaged with little difficulty after an initial settling in period. </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities. The response to supporting the wellbeing of all within school communities on the return to school required a structured, compassionate, psychosocial response with a largely preventative and proactive focus.  This required a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and was based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some students and their families may need additional support for wellbeing and to settle back into school that is in addition to the universal wellbeing supports being provided for all students. Schools have been supported with this response by the provision of a range of further guidance and support from my Department&rsquo;s Psychological Support Service, NEPS, by the Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) and with support from HSE Services, including access to e-mental health services.  NEPS psychologists now have an increased focus on both consultation and casework in schools with particular attention to the needs of individual students.  Psychologists are providing a blended approach to the provision of casework to schools, working both remotely, and where appropriate in-school, depending of the nature of need.  As part of a package of measures to support the reopening of our schools the provision of an additional seventeen psychologist posts to NEPS was announced bringing overall sanctioned numbers to 221 whole time equivalent psychologist posts.  </p></reply>

Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional support to meet the needs of students with significant care needs. </p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>Schools were expected to review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation is not sufficient to meet the level of care needs within the mainstream classes. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here </p></reply>

Assisted by Department funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  </p><p>My Department published a series of<i>Continuity of</i>documents to help schools, education professionals and parents to support children learning in a remote environment.  They included links to a range of materials developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (a Department support service for teachers) such as learning platforms and online tools which can be used to support remote/distance teaching and learning. Those resources continue to be available to schools. There is also ongoing consultation with the management bodies and unions from both sectors on all matters relating to the safe return to school in the context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which is an evolving situation. All guidance documents are under review and will be updated to take account of the current situation and to support schools further in maintaining continuity of schooling for all learners including those at very high risk and unable to return to school at this time. </p><p>A commitment of &euro;210m was provided under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 for improved ICT infrastructure, of which &euro;160m has issued to schools to date, including &euro;50m which issued earlier this year. In the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic schools can use this funding to address ICT needs including the purchase of devices, software and other ICT solutions to support the provision of remote learning.  This may include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with learners who do not have access to devices and for the purchase of essential learning platforms. The remaining &euro;50m under this provision will issue to schools during the current school year (2020-2021) subject to the availability of exchequer funding.</p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools. The information on their website outlines what these devices can offer schools to support teaching, learning and assessment, and facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration, including software and hardware requirements and purchasing regulations, are addressed in the support information. </p><p>It is recognised that poor access to home broadband does present challenges for the education system in the current crisis. With this in mind, schools have been asked to consider the needs of students who may not have access to online facilities and to address this in their responses. My Department will continue to work with the education partners to provide guidance to schools about how best to use digital and other solutions to provide continuity for students at this time. </p></reply>

This template is a guide for schools in how they can set out for students and parents/guardians, the COVID-19 health and safety control measures to be followed by students in their school and ensure that any non-adherence to the measures concerned can be addressed by the school through the school&rsquo;s code of behaviour for students. </p><p>In accordance with the policy, students are expected to comply with the standards of behaviour set out in the policy or as directed by the school to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19.

Any failure or refusal to comply with this policy or to follow instructions of school staff should be dealt with in accordance with the school&rsquo;s Code of Behaviour.

Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools.</p>  <p>  Previous budgets of 2016 and 2018 improved the staffing schedule by one point on both occasions to its historically lowest level ever of 1 teacher to 26 pupils. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  </p>  <p>  I am delighted to build further on this progress by announcing a further 1 point reduction in Budget 2021.  </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for the 2021/22 academic year now stands at 1 teacher for every 25 pupils. This measure will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that  less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.   </p>  <p>  Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the 2019/20 school year and this has led to a steady improvement in the pupil teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period. </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2019/20 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes.</p></reply>

As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p>  <p>  The system of calculated grades is underpinned by key principles of objectivity, equity and fairness.  The process has been designed to arrive at fair representations of student performance which does not favour any type of student or school. </p>  <p>  Circular 0037/2020, which was published on 21 May, set out the detailed guidance for schools on the operation of the calculated grades process. The document provided detailed information on the process of estimating marks for students to receive calculated grades.  Additional guidance to schools on the avoidance of unconscious bias and interpreting evidence of achievement in the case of students with disabilities was issued to schools on 28 May. </p>  <p>  In line with the guidance, teachers were asked to use their professional judgement to arrive at an estimated mark for each student. The guidance required teachers to utilise a number of records in assessing a student&rsquo;s performance and progress; for example, classwork and homework; class assessments; examinations in school at Christmas or summer, mock exams and also coursework.</p>  <p>  The same guidance also advised schools that where any reasonable accommodation had been approved for any student, (such as a reader, scribe or waiver), the estimate of the student&rsquo;s likely performance was to be based on the assumption that this accommodation would have been available had the examinations been conducted in the normal way. </p>  <p>  Since accommodations are intended to reflect students&rsquo; normal way of working in class, this would not have required any special intervention beyond the teacher&rsquo;s existing understanding of how the student gets on with the relevant supports in place.</p>  <p>  Therefore, a student&rsquo;s access to any reasonable accommodation is also reflected in the final Calculated Grade awarded to the students.</p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams due to commence on 16 November, subject to public health advice. </p>  <p>  The marking of the November examinations will rely principally on the expert judgment of the Chief Examiner and members of the senior examining team in the State Examinations Commission (SEC) based on the content of the examination papers and the demands of the marking scheme. This expert judgment approach will ensure that the standards applied in the marking of these examinations will be fair and valid for these candidates, who form a small subset of the overall candidature for Leaving Certificate 2020.</p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate candidates sitting the written examinations in November who opted to receive Calculated Grades will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written examination.</p>  <p>  2020 Applicants to the CAO will have their final Leaving Certificate results forwarded to the CAO, using their best results of examinations and Calculated Grades, where applicable. They will receive any relevant CAO offers that their results indicate, as a deferred offer for 2021/22. </p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education have worked closely with the higher education institutions to increase the number of third level places available for incoming first years, for all CAO applicants.  There were extensive additional higher education places in 2020 &ndash; the most places ever offered. </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for payment for the 2020/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. </p>  <p>  Children who apply for transport and who are not eligible under the terms of the scheme are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.  </p>  <p>  Concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s primary school education cycle.  Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann determines the allocation of the tickets and refunds payments made on behalf of those concessionary applicants for whom no seats remain. </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed, that the child to whom the Deputy refers, is not eligible for school transport as he is not attending his nearest post primary school and is therefore not eligible under the terms of the scheme. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that payment for school transport for the 2020/2021 school year was received by the family in question on 8th September 2020 and as such is late.</p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. In addition, payments or submission of medical card details for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route. </p>  <p>  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.</p></reply>

The Department next year will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion, or over 20% of its total educational budget annually, on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.</p><p>This represents an increase of over 50% in total expenditure since 2011. </p><p>This investment will allow us to provide over 1,200 extra special class places next year. </p><p>There are currently over 13,550 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream schools, supporting the additional learning needs of pupils, of which 9,325 are allocated to primary schools. </p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the provision for special education teachers since 2011. </p><p>An additional 145 special education teachers will also be available for allocation next year.</p><p>The number of SNAs in the school system has increased by almost 60% since 2011.</p><p>Approximately 1,000 additional SNAs will also be allocated to schools next year, bringing the total number to 18,000.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p><p>As Minister, I have powers under Section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort and where all reasonable efforts have failed. However, the experience to date shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed effectively by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p></reply>

The main elements of this pipeline currently involve 372 large-scale projects and circa. 800 projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Additional Accommodation Scheme.  The pipeline will continue to be monitored to ensure it is aligned with Spending Code requirements and the objectives of Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware there were circa 200 school building projects on site in early 2020 when, in line with National Public Health announcements by Government, all construction sites in relation to the education sector ceased in March 2020.  The construction sector has re-opened on a gradual and phased basis since Monday 18th May.  While the construction sites were closed, the pipeline of projects in design continued to be progressed in an online and remote working environment. The progression of this pipeline helped smooth the impact of Covid-19 on the overall rollout of Project Ireland 2040 within the education sector. Throughout the remobilisation process my Department has continued to work closely with school authorities and patron bodies to ensure that projects progress and that where necessary contingency arrangements are in place to deal with any issues as they arise. To date, all school building projects resumed on site with the exception of two and discussions are ongoing with the contractor to recommence construction on both sites.  </p>  <p>  By way of information, my Department&rsquo;s website www.education.ie shows the current status of projects being delivered in Kildare and in all other counties.  This website is updated on a regular basis to reflect the progress of individual projects through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction.</p></reply>

Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools.</p>  <p>  Previous budgets of 2016 and 2018 improved the staffing schedule by one point on both occasions to its historically lowest level ever of 1 teacher to 26 pupils. Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  </p>  <p>  I am delighted to build further on this progress by announcing a further 1 point reduction in Budget 2021.  </p>  <p>  The staffing schedule for the 2021/22 academic year now stands at 1 teacher for every 25 pupils. This measure will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that  less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.   </p>  <p>  Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the 2019/20 school year and this has led to a steady improvement in the pupil teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period. </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2019/20 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 24.1 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons to apply for patronage of a new school under the patronage process. Parental preferences for each patron, together with the extent of diversity currently available in the area, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p><p>Separately, 12 new multi-denominational schools have been established under the patronage divesting process.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;264 million this year on HHB for over 465,000 customers.  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  Based on an average of 330,637 persons aged 70 years or over,receiving the HHB package in 2021, the estimated full year cost of increasing the HHB package by &euro;2.50 a week for those aged 70 or over to offset the cost of broadband would be in the region of &euro;43 million in 2021.  An additional &euro;20 a month increase to the HHB package for the same cohort of recipients would cost in the region of &euro;80 million in 2021. The estimate is based on the increase being implemented from January 2021.  Further increased costs would obviously also arise in future years, related to the numbers then receiving HHB.</p>  <p>  Any decision to enhance the HHB package by the introduction of a broadband element to the package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I know many employees who have been laid off are experiencing great uncertainty but, in making this decision, the Government had to consider the need to ensure businesses survive, which in turn ensures further permanent job losses are avoided as much as possible.</p>  <p>  This emergency provision, Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, was enacted in order to ensure the future viability of businesses and help prevent permanent job losses.  As a result of Covid-19 there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-off and short time work situations.  Under the existing provisions these lay-off and short-time situations could result in significant redundancy claims on employers in a very short period of time.  Employers are obliged to pay redundancy entitlements to employees who have been temporarily laid off or placed on short-time work after a period of time.  In light of the on-going emergency situation, the Government decided to extend the temporary suspension until 30th November 2020 in order to support businesses in continuing to recover and re-open and plan their future staffing requirements.</p>  <p>  A decision has not been made yet on whether this emergency provision will continue after the 30th November and it will require discussion at Government level.  In its deliberations the Government will have regard to the criteria and principles underpinning the emergency provision and the public health and labour market situations.</p></reply>

This is in keeping with commitments in Pathways to Work to target initiatives at those who are long-term unemployed. Also, in determining eligibility, a person must not have in excess of 30 days in cumulative employment in the previous 12 months.  If they exceed 30 worked days in that time, then they fall outside the definition of long-term unemployed for the programme eligibility purposes, as they have proved themselves to be capable of finding and retaining employment.  As the person concerned has been working casually and has in excess of the 30 days allowable during the last 12 months, he is not currently eligible for Community Employment. He is currently fully unemployed and if he continues to be fully unemployed and in receipt of a qualifying payment he will be eligible to apply for a CE vacancy and if successful to take up a placement from Monday 1st March 2021 for a period of one year.</p>  <p>  There are however a number of options open to those who do not qualify for CE.

While there is no specific legislative provision regarding parental alienation in Irish family law, section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or wellbeing.</p>  <p>  There is also a range of legislative provisions in place for dealing with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues. </p>  <p>  As you may already be aware the Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on Reform of the Family Law System, which was published late last year, considered the issue of parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.</p>  <p>  A Family Justice Oversight Group was established within the Department of Justice and Equality the membership of which includes representatives from the judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and my Department.  Indications are that recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s report will be integrated into the work of that group.</p>  <p>  Social workers in Tusla review all referrals concerning a child welfare or child protection matter and prioritise their response on the basis of potential or real risk of harm to the child. Throughout the pandemic, Tusla prioritised their direct engagement with children on the Child Protection Notification System or in need of an assessment regarding harm, with children in care in relation to access with families and with victims of domestic violence. </p>  <p>  The courts may refer civil cases to Tusla where parental custody disputes are impacting on the welfare and safety of a child, and Tusla takes into account issues relating to &lsquo;parental alienation&rsquo; in their assessment and engagement with the family. </p></reply>

The most recent data, from Pobal&rsquo;s latest Early Years Sector Profile Report 2018/2019, indicates a staff turnover rate of 23% which, despite an improvement on the previous year, is unsustainably high. I have met with employee and employer representatives on a number of occasions and have listened to their concerns, including on staff turnover.</p>  <p>  The key challenge to retaining staff is undoubtedly wages and working conditions. Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The most recent data indicates that the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare was &euro;12.55 in mid-2019.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff to improve levels of staff retention. I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. Recent measures that have been taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on a formulating a new funding model for the sector which may assist in improving pay, and therefore staff turnover in the sector. In addition, work is under way to develop a Workforce Development Plan, which will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector and establish role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and working towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.</p>  <p>  I launched an extensive consultation on both the new funding model and the Workforce Development Plan on 19 August. The consultation process includes a call for submissions/survey, which ran from August to 2 October. Online consultation events are currently taking place from 12-22 October in evenings with those involved in the sector. </p></reply>

Under the Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees of eligible students pursuing an approved full-time undergraduate course of study in an approved institution in the State. Eligible students must meet the terms of the scheme including the nationality and residency clauses.</p>  <p>  Students must hold inter alia Irish/EU/EEA/Swiss/UK nationality or certain permissions to reside in the state as granted by the Minister for Justice in their own right and have been ordinarily resident in Ireland or an EU/EEA/Swiss/UK state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</p>  <p>   Where undergraduate students do not qualify for free fees funding they must pay the appropriate fee, either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each higher education institution. Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and therefore the criteria governing the level of fee payable by students (EU or non-EU) is a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  The nationality requirements for the Student Grant Scheme are set out in Section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and Regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2020. To qualify for a student grant, it is the candidate's nationality or his/her immigration status in the State that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Act and Regulations. </p>  <p>  With regard to the residency criterion, in order to be eligible for a grant, a "student", as defined in Section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011, must demonstrate that he/she has been resident in the State for at least three years out of the five year period ending on the day before the start of his/her approved course of study.  </p>  <p>  Article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2020 provides for a review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of a change of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status. Where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation, or is granted one of the permission to remain criterion provided for in the Act or Regulations during the course of their studies, he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed.</p>  <p>  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020.

The student contribution fee is currently set at &euro;3,000 per annum and can be paid in instalments.  The State pays the contribution in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impact of the pandemic has had on our students. To ensure the safety of our students and staff in further and higher education, the majority of college will be online for this semester and we will provide financial assistance through a once off &euro;50 million fund. My officials and I are developing the process on how this once-off fund will operate for submission to Government prior to commencement. Once finalized the details will be available for students. </p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 will provide further funding to provide enhanced SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increased support for the PATH access initiative to increase participation in Higher Education from the most economically disadvantaged students.</p>  <p>  This builds on the specific student supports in response to Covid, which I announced in July including the provision of additional student assistance including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education to assist with difficulties in accessing technology to facilitate their course work in a blended capacity.  These supports are being distributed through the colleges and further education providers. </p>  <p>  Our higher education sector is continuing to operate through intensified protective measures which were announced on 25th September in line with public health advice. This has meant that on-site activity will be minimised so long as these measures are in place. While I appreciate that this may be disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures are necessary if the spread of the Coronavirus is to be halted.</p>  <p>  These measures will be reviewed as the public health situation evolves, and I, my Department, and the Higher Education Institutions will continue to act in the best interests of students and staff.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the delivery of further and higher education in the context of Covid-19 will cost the providers more not less.  The Government has provided additional funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education and the additional funding provided for student supports will be of assistance to many students particularly those with the least financial resources. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government undertakes to provide a long term sustainable funding model for higher education.  In addition the range of student supports operated by SUSI will be subject to review as announced in Budget 2021. An important objective will be to ensure access to and continued participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with further and higher education providers, agencies and key stakeholders including student representatives to mitigate the additional pressures faced as a result of covid-19.  </p></reply>

Local Garda management are satisfied that there are sufficient resources available in the North Inner City area to efficiently address the rise in anti-social behaviour. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Covid-19 crisis has shown how proactive and collaborative community engagement by community services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can improve the condition of peoples&rsquo; lives.  For example, since the onset of the Covid-19 restrictions, Garda&iacute; attached to Store Street Garda Station have increased engagement with the more vulnerable members of society in the North East Inner City area of Dublin, through volunteer services, service providers and on an individual basis.  </p><p>As part of the implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, my Department is devising a policy on a whole-of-Government approach to community safety which aims to help foster local communities that are safer for families, residents and businesses and that feel more secure. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to know that detailed information in relation to Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

To date, 29 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants awarded totalling more than &euro;752,000. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p>  <p>  Recognising the value of these schemes in helping in the detection of crime in local areas, &euro;1m in funding has been provided for the continuation of this scheme in Budget 2021. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to Muintir na T&iacute;re for purposes including Text Alert/Community Alert groups nationwide.</p></reply>

The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

However, this amendment was not adopted, and the Bill then passed second stage. </p>  <p>  The Bill as originally proposed will now proceed to pre-committee scrutiny where it will be examined section by section. The detailed process at pre-committee will afford an opportunity for the provisions of the proposed PMB to be fully debated. </p>  <p>  While the Bill as proposed does provide a number of safeguards, including that the process is medically led and that the person must be terminally ill, there are still important issues that will need to be considered as the Bill progresses through the legislative process. Of utmost importance will be ensuring that the competing interests of the individual are balanced with the wider public interest in safeguarding people who are nearing the end of their lives and who might be vulnerable and at risk of abuse.</p>  <p>  There is a vital public interest in protecting vulnerable people, which we want to ensure, and it is important that the Oireachtas takes its time to consider the proposed law in its entirety, including all of the necessary procedures and safeguards that should be provided if the Bill is to be adopted. The views of all stakeholders, and in particular of medical professionals and palliative care consultants, will be an important part of the considerations that feed into this process.  </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I did not have any discussions or engagements with palliative care consultants or medical professionals prior to the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann votes on the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020. I can confirm that a number of submissions were sent into my Department in relation to the Private Members Bill prior to the vote, a small number of which were from palliative care consultants and medical professionals. </p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Ireland is moving from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are  at Level 3 of the Plan for living with Covid-19 until 28th October.  Further information on the public health measures in currently in place in relation  to the different Levels can be found at  </p><p>Yoga classes are regarded as exercise and sporting events under the Plan and where possible, such classes can be held online. However one-to-one yoga exercise is permissible where one of those present is the trainer. </p><p>Under Levels 3, 4 and 5 indoor training is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore exercise and sporting events, including classes, cannot take place.</p><p>Under Level 2 restrictions, indoor classes, training and exercise can take place in pods of up to 6 people, once sufficient space is available and strict public health protocols are in place.</p><p>Under Level 1 of the Framework, there is no specific capacity limit, with capacity guided by what can be accommodated safely in the venue while ensuring all protective measures are in place, including social distancing. </p><p>At level 3, exercise and sporting events can take place outdoors subject to level 3 guidelines.  Further information on Level 3 guidance for outdoor exercise and sport can be found at: .</p><p>Further information on exercise and sporting events under the Plan is available at:  and on Ireland Active at </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.

They also govern the staffing and reporting arrangements in a pharmacy, and they prescribe the record keeping requirements which apply around the supply of medicines. The pertinent requirements which apply in the Regulations of 2008 will also apply equally in respect of any service that is delivered offsite from the pharmacy to ensure it is safe and appropriate. </p></reply>

Given the importance of significantly increasing the level of uptake of the vaccine for the coming winter, resources will be provided to GPs and pharmacists not only to deliver the vaccination to the expanded groups, but to actively seek relevant patients and deliver vaccinations in a programmatic way, such as through dedicated flu vaccination clinics.</p>  <p>  The expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access to vaccination without charges. By providing vaccination to those most at-risk, and those most likely to require hospitalisation if they contract influenza, it is anticipated that the programme will see a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospital admissions, as well as a reduction in the overall spread of influenza in the community.</p>  <p>  I have recently signed Regulations which enable pharmacists to provide vaccination services offsite from the pharmacy premises. Providing an influenza vaccination service at non-pharmacy locations has the potential to greatly increase uptake of the influenza vaccine in all the groups, who can avail of the  vaccine free of charge  in particular those in the at-risk categories, as well as patients wishing to access this service privately. It also enables pharmacists who may be unable to provide a vaccination service on their pharmacy premises during the 2020/21 flu season, to continue to provide this service for their patients and local community, albeit at a different, but safe location.  No change was required to permit GPs to administer vaccines away from their surgeries.</p>  <p>  Administration of the vaccines has commenced with both regular, opportunistic vaccinations and through dedicated, out-of-hours, vaccination clinics which aim to maximise the number of patients vaccinated in the safest way possible without interfering with the day-to-day running of practices. Special arrangements for the administration of vaccines, such as the dedicated out-of-hours vaccination clinics, will continue to be arranged at the discretion of the GP or pharmacist in accordance the vaccine delivery schedule and their patient&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  In relation to the capacity in the sector, officials from my Department engaged in consultations with the IMO and the IPU in advance of commencing the programme in order to ensure that it could be delivered effectively.</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are currently at Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19 until midnight Tuesday 27th October.</p><p>At Level 3 of the plan, you must not leave your county of residence unless for work, education, medical and other essential purposes. </p><p>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 6) Regulations, 2020 (S.I. No. 413 of 2020). These Regulations provide that &quot;county of residence&quot; means the county in which the person's place of residence is situated. For a person who is not ordinarily resident in the State, &quot;place of residence&quot; means the premises in the State, if any, at which he or she is currently residing, whether on a permanent or temporary basis. </p><p>Further information on the public health measures currently in place at Level 3 can be found at .</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Ireland is moving from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are  at Level 3 of the Plan for living with Covid-19 until 28th October.  Further information on the public health measures in currently in place in relation  to the different Levels can be found at .</p><p>Dance classes are classified as exercise and sporting events under the Plan. </p><p>Under Levels 3, 4 and 5 indoor training is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore exercise and sporting events, including classes, cannot take place.</p><p>Under Level 2 restrictions, indoor dance classes, training and exercise can take place in pods of up to 6 people, once sufficient space is available and strict public health protocols are in place.</p><p>Under Level 1 of the Framework, there is no specific capacity limit, with capacity guided by what can be accommodated safely in the venue while ensuring all protective measures are in place, including social distancing. </p><p>Further information on exercise and sporting events under the Plan is available at:  and on Ireland Active at .</p></reply>

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>Ireland has moved from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland are at of the Plan for living with Covid-19 until 28th October.  Further information on the public health measures in currently in place in relation  to the different Levels can be found at  </p><p>Yoga classes are classified as exercise and sporting events under the Plan and where possible, such classes can be held online.</p><p>Under Levels 3, 4 and 5 indoor training is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore exercise and sporting events, including classes, cannot take place.</p><p>Under Level 2 restrictions, indoor classes, training and exercise can take place in pods of up to 6 people, once sufficient space is available and strict public health protocols are in place.</p><p>Under Level 1 of the Framework, there is no specific capacity limit, with capacity guided by what can be accommodated safely in the venue while ensuring all protective measures are in place, including social distancing. </p><p>Further information on exercise and sporting events under the Plan is available at:  and on Ireland Active at </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.</p><p>The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments.

The maximum eligible project cost under this year&rsquo;s scheme is &euro;200,000, with my Department contributing 75% of funding and the relevant Local Authority providing 25%. The package provides funding for maintenance and repair works in addition to supporting the ongoing development and enhancement of harbour facilities, including some marine leisure developments.</p></reply>

The purpose of these Regulations is to give effect to Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme for the protection of waters against pollution caused by agricultural sources. The set of measures in these regulations provides a basic level of protection against possible adverse impacts to waters arising from the agricultural sources. </p><p>A review of Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates derogation was undertaken in 2019. The review examined further opportunities for derogation farmers to improve efficiencies and continue to reduce their environmental footprint with particular regard to water, climate, biodiversity and air quality.  It is accepted that compliance of a higher standard is required from more intensive derogation farmers to ensure a greater level of environment efficiency is achieved. One of the conclusions of the review highlighted interalia, that <i>&ldquo;In addition, the Commission has requested Ireland to review some of the technical aspects of the Nitrates Action Programme and ........the annual excretion rates for livestock as per Table 6 of SI 605 2017 be reviewed based on most recent scientific research&rdquo;</i></p><p>The current excretion rates for livestock are specified in Table 6 of Schedule 2 (Annex 1) of Statutory Instrument 605 of 2017. The excretion rates for livestock were last evaluated in 2003. In 2019, Teagasc reviewed the excretion rate for the Dairy Cow following the recommendations of the Review group.</p><p>The outcome of the review was that the most accurate excretion figure for the average Irish dairy cow is 89kgs of nitrogen. The impact of this change is a 5% increase in the level of livestock manure nitrogen produced by dairy cows in Ireland. This reflects the higher average milk yields that farmers are achieving now compared to when the figure was first calculated over 25 years ago.</p><p>All farmers are required to comply with stocking rate limits, 170kgs N/ha or in the case of derogation farmers 250 kgs N/ha. Farmers can comply with limits by reducing stock numbers, exporting slurry or renting extra land. </p><p>All farmers with dairy cows (approx 17,000) will be affected by this increase. </p></reply>

The secondary legislation required to give effect to the Act was implemented on Wednesday 8th October. </p><p>The new Act, amending the Agriculture Appeals Act was designed to align forestry licensing appeals process with best practice in other appeals processes.  </p><p>The Act provides a number of mechanisms to improve the efficiency and delivery of services to stakeholders by: </p><p>-  Increasing the capacity of the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) to determine appeals by enabling it to sit in divisions of itself;</p><p>-  Enabling the FAC to determine appeals without an oral hearing where it is possible to properly dispose of an appeal in that manner;</p><p>-  Introducing fees for appeals, by means of regulation;</p><p>-  Allowing all interested parties to appeal directly to the FAC, with no restrictions on access. </p><p>I have now moved to resource the FAC to commence hearing more appeals in line with the provisions set out in the Act. It will be a matter for the FAC to report on their own progress and they update their decisions weekly on their own website. </p><p>I believe that the provisions in the Act, along with our Project Plans for managing the licensing backlog, will greatly improve the overall system and result in an increase in the number of licences available for planting and felling and decision-making system which is more fit for purpose and meets the needs of all stakeholders.</p></reply>

However, as an exceptional measure for 2020, funding was provided for larger towns, including Mullingar, under a new Measure aimed at assisting towns to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19.  The inclusion of larger towns on this occasion was in recognition of their importance in supporting the economic and social fabric of their rural hinterlands.</p></reply>
