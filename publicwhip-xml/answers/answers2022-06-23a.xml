    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-23a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062300057#WRA00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 13 together.</p>  <p>The continuing increase in the numbers accessing emergency accommodation throughout the country is a serious concern. The Government, local authorities and others are making every effort to reduce homelessness. Key to this is the delivery of new social housing and boosting overall supply.</p>  <p>  The Government is investing significantly in social and affordable housing, with record funding allocated for current and capital investment in housing this year alone. This year funding is in place to deliver 11,800 social homes, including 9,000 new build homes, thus building on the progress made last year when 9,183 new social homes were provided, a 17% increase on 2020.</p>  <p>  More specifically, I have established the National Homeless Action Committee with initial key priorities being the advancement of additional measures to prevent Homelessness and the Youth Homelessness Strategy. The Committee will meet again in early July to further advance these measures.</p>  <p>  I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) discretion rate to 35% and to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons for new tenancies. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a review of Housing Delivery Action Plans which were submitted by local authorities.  These have included specific provision for one-bed units which are critical for exits for single homeless people, and for the delivery of 4-bed units, which are key in supporting exits from homelessness for larger families. </p>  <p>  There will be a new Voids programme for 2022 with an emphasis on quick turnaround and re-letting of vacant social housing stock. In addition, the Government has recently approved a pilot expansion of the Repair and Leasing scheme which will open the scheme to a wider range of owners, by removing the criteria that a property owner must be unable to fund or access funding to bring former vacant commercial and institutional buildings back into use. These measures will make more properties available to be allocated to people on the social housing waiting list, including those in emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  Recently, I also reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions that meet certain criteria.  This will allow local authorities more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are currently severe pressures on access to emergency accommodation in certain areas of the country, which local authorities are working to address. My Department are liaising with Regional Homeless Leads and local authorities, and resources will not be an obstacle to the urgent efforts required.</p>  <p>  We are providing more social homes, we are completing more homes in general and we have a strong pipeline of homes commenced. This supply activity, as well as targeted measures specifically centred on homelessness, will allow us to meet the challenge of eradicating homelessness.</p></reply>

These schemes assist eligible applicants living in privately owned homes to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs. Funding of &euro;81.25 million is available nationally in 2022 which is an increase of &euro;6.25 million on the 2021 provision of &euro;75 million, continuing the year on year increases since 2014.</p>  <p>  Housing for All commits to reviewing the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability. The review is now underway within my Department and is being informed by ongoing engagement with external stakeholders, for example, the Department of Health, the HSE, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association and Jack and Jill Foundation. Submissions have been invited from key stakeholders such as these this week in relation to the review of the suite of grants. I have met a number of these groups and understand the issues that people with a disability are experiencing when trying to find suitable accommodation options in the current market.</p>  <p>  Among the areas which the review will consider are the income thresholds, the grant limits, the application and decision making processes, including supplementary documentation required. The review is to be completed by the end of 2022.  Once the review is completed full consideration will be given to its contents.  Following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, proposals for any recommended revisions to the existing scheme will be brought to Government.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026.</p>  <p>  In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority for the period 2022-2026 and in March I issued local authority targets for affordable purchase and cost-rental.  The targets for Waterford County Council include the delivery of 1,057 new build social homes, 46 social homes through long-term leasing and 76 affordable homes between 2022 and 2026.  Waterford City and County Council have already funding approved to support the delivery of 119 affordable purchase homes under advance purchase arrangements, exceeding their targeted level of affordable delivery.</p>  <p>  A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022 - 2026. All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans to me in December and my Department is now working closely with the local authorities to review and finalise the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. The Plans will be published by local authorities before the end of Quarter 2. </p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme to support affordable purchases of new homes in the private market will operate nationwide. Targeted at First Time Buyers or those eligible under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle, the Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders, and will be launched in the coming weeks. It will improve access to newly-built homes by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. The homes must be priced within regional price ceilings which will reflect the median prices paid by First Time Buyers for new homes in each area, so this is an intervention to support homeownership in the lower region of the market.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-23a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062300057#WRA01900"><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026.  In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority for the period 2022-2026. For 2022, Cavan has a target to deliver 150 new build social homes and Monaghan has a target to deliver 125 new build social homes.  </p>  <p>  My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity by all local authorities. This data is available to the end of 2021, and is published on the Local Authority Housing Scheme Statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website (www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/). Data for Q1 2022 social housing delivery is currently being collated and will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  Local authorities with a strong and identified affordable housing need were asked to prepare Affordable Delivery Action Plans and were set five-year Affordable Delivery Targets.  In counties without affordable delivery targets, including Cavan and Monaghan, where localised affordability challenges in key towns arise they can still apply to my Department for funding to develop affordable housing schemes where they can demonstrate that an affordable scheme is needed to address those localised affordability challenges and they can meet the criteria for the Affordable Housing Fund.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme to support affordable purchases of new homes in the private market will operate nationwide and so will encompass Cavan and Monaghan. Targeted at First Time Buyers or those eligible under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle, the Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders, and will be launched in the coming weeks. It will improve access to newly-built homes by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes.

Biodiversity officers are the public face of biodiversity-related activities within the local authority, commissioning biodiversity surveys, implementing community related projects to improve the status of biodiversity in the local authority area, and organising relevant public events. Biodiversity officers advise local authorities in relation to their obligations with regard to national and local biodiversity policies, programmes and priorities. </p><p>There are currently five biodiversity officers employed in the following local authorities: </p><p>Fingal County Council; </p><p>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council </p><p>Dublin City Council </p><p>Galway City Council </p><p>Kerry County Council. </p><p>My Department is committed to supporting local authorities in the important role they play in the implementation of actions contained in the National Biodiversity Action Plan. In that context, &euro;600k has been allocated in 2022 towards the programme, with six officers to be recruited this year and a further roll out in 2023/24. The programme is currently under development and will be delivered by the Heritage Council and County and City Management Association, with the support of my Department. Expressions of interest for participation in the pilot will be advertised by the Heritage Council in early July and it is expected that participating Local Authorities will begin recruiting in August. </p></reply>

When Irish Water was established in 2014, they inherited a system in need of very significant improvement.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, the National Development Plan 2021-2030 commits to almost &euro;6 billion in capital  investment by Irish Water in the period from 2021-2025, of which over &euro;4.5 billion will be Voted Exchequer funded in respect of domestic water services. As part of Budget 2022, I secured funding of over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.459 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. </p>  <p>  In April 2022 I announced &euro;50 million in funding from the NDP to provide waste water facilities in areas not serviced with waste water collection and treatment systems.  The EU funded National Recovery and Resilience Programme includes the &euro;20m River Basin Management Plan Enhanced Ambition Programme which aims to complete 10 small waste water treatment plants.</p>  <p>  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine areas.</p></reply>

This review is now complete. Included in the exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the draft solar regulations as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) process was launched on 15 June 2022. The consultation will run until 13 July 2022.  Further information in relation to the consultation, including the full suite of documentation such as the SEA Environmental Report and details regarding how to make a submission, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before the finalisation of the draft regulations. </p></reply>

A tenant, or the RTB itself, can also instigate an RTB investigation into possible improper conduct by a landlord, including in respect of a contravention of tenancy termination procedures, and impose a sanction of up to &euro;30,000, if warranted. </p>  <p>  Section 35A of the Residential Tenancies Acts (known as the &lsquo;Tyrrelstown amendment&rsquo;) provides that where a landlord proposes to sell 10 or  more units within a single development at the same time, that sale is subject to the existing tenants remaining in situ, other than in exceptional circumstances. The &lsquo;Tyrrelstown amendment&rsquo; was carefully drafted to promote security of tenure in the interest of the common social good.</p>  <p>  The provision strikes a balance, between a landlord&rsquo;s right to sell their property and achieve fair return on their investment, and a tenant&rsquo;s right to security of tenure. The commercial reality is that there is generally a lower market value for a property sold with tenants in situ. </p>  <p>  Any proposal to remove the landlord&rsquo;s right to terminate a tenancy in the case of every rental property being sold would carry with it a risk of a constitutional challenge.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in May 2021 the Government introduced a series of measures designed to prohibit the bulk buying of houses and duplexes. This included the Section 28 Guidelines for Planning Authorities &ldquo;Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing&rdquo; to planning authorities which aimed to prevent multiple units being sold to a single buyer. In addition a 10% stamp duty levy was introduced for the cumulative purchase of 10 or more residential houses in a 12 month period.</p></reply>

Further details will be available when the engagement process is complete. These changes will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p></reply>

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs. </p><p><i>Housing for All </i>is set out across four pathways to addressing the most pressing housing challenges facing the State: </p><p>1.Pathway to Supporting homeownership and Increasing Affordability</p><p>2.Pathway to Eradicating Homelessness, Increasing Social Housing Delivery and Supporting Social Inclusion</p><p>3.Pathway to Increasing New Housing Supply</p><p>4.Pathway to Addressing vacancy and Efficient Use of Existing Stock </p><p>These pathways are underpinned by long-term actions to address systemic challenges. It is a whole-of-Government Plan which aims to create a housing system which has environmental, social and economic sustainability at its heart and which meets the needs of all.</p><p>Importantly, a comprehensive implementation and reporting framework is well established to assess how the actions under the Plan are progressing. These structures include political oversight, via the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Housing, the Housing for All Secretary General Delivery Group, and dedicated Workstreams, all of which monitor delivery of the Plan and recommend any adjustments to priorities, as required, on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Progress reports are published quarterly. The fourth of these reports, covering progress in Q2 2022 is due for publication in July. These reports can be accessed on www.gov.ie/en/collection/9d2ee-housing-for-all-quarterly-progress-reports/.</p><p>I acknowledge that the capacity of Local Authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects requires the resourcing of their housing services. In this regard, I have sanctioned over 250 additional Local Authority posts, which are in the process of being filled across housing delivery teams in order to deliver on Housing for All's ambition. Key supports are also being provided through the Housing Delivery Co-Ordination Office (HDCO), which has been established within the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), to provide co-ordination of Local Authority housing activities. In addition, The Housing Agency&rsquo;s Procurement and Delivery Unit is also being expanded to provide technical services and supports to Local Authorities, including in procurement, design and modern methods of construction.</p><p>Housing cannot be delivered unless we have the supporting critical infrastructure, including transport, communication services and utility connections. A sustainable housing system requires strong integration between housing developments and the surrounding infrastructure and the move to plan-led development in this Plan will support this integrated system.</p><p>Transport infrastructure and access to public transport services are a critical enablers of new housing supply. A well-functioning housing system should be supported by transport routes. Together, my Department and the Department of Transport, along with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and the LDA, aim to bring public transport to as many people as possible through better land-use and transport planning, to meet the National Planning Framework objective of &lsquo;compact growth&rsquo;. In this regard, a working group has been established to consider opportunities for transport-led development in major urban centres.</p><p>For their part, Irish Water are supporting the delivery of <i>Housing for All</i>through a number of actions, including the timely delivery of housing connections. Irish Water&rsquo;s Connections and Developer Services team is responsible for the end-to-end customer management of all connections to the Irish Water network. The team partners with industry and supports Government housing and planning policies to provide an efficient national connection service to all those developing property. Early engagement with the Irish Water Pre-Connection Enquiry service by those seeking connection to the Irish Water network is critical to ascertaining the capacity of the public water services to facilitate the proposed network connection.</p><p>Increasing housing supply is at the core of Housing for All. Indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident which will help increase the availability of homes across all tenures.  </p><p>This year, the Government&rsquo;s target under Housing for All is 24,600 new homes. In the 12 months to the end of March 2022, a total of 22,219 new homes were completed. In the past 12 months (June 2021 to May 2022), Commencement Notices for 30,233 new homes were received. In addition, latest CSO figures show planning permissions for all residential dwellings are up 22.7% in the year ending Q1 2022 (44,491) when compared to the same time period to Q1 2021 (36,252). Together, the figures point to a substantial uplift in new housing supply in the coming years, as we increase output to average of at least 33,000 new homes per year. This increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026.  In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority for the period 2022-2026 and in March I issued local authority targets for affordable purchase and cost-rental.  Cork County Council has a target to deliver 560 social homes and 10 affordable purchase or cost rental homes in 2022.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to determine the location of social and affordable housing projects, having regard to the identified need. A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022 - 2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All. All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans to me in December and my Department is now working closely with the local authorities to review and finalise the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. The Plans will be published by local authorities before the end of Quarter 2.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity by all local authorities. This data is available to the end of 2021, and is published on the Local Authority Housing Scheme Statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/. Data for Quarter 1 2022 social housing delivery is currently being collated and will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  I would also mention that the First Home Scheme to support affordable purchases of new homes in the private market will operate nationwide. Targeted at First Time Buyers or those eligible under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle, the Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders, and will be launched in the coming weeks. It will improve access to newly-built homes by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. The homes must be priced within regional price ceilings which will reflect the median prices paid by First Time Buyers for new homes in each area, so this is an intervention to support homeownership in the lower region of the market.</p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, including those relating to the installation of solar panels on the roofs of houses and agricultural structures, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The draft regulations have also been screened for Appropriate Assessment (AA) under the Habitats Directive by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit (EAU) and the need for AA has been screened out. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the draft solar regulations as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) process was launched on 15 June 2022. The consultation will run until 13 July 2022.  Further information in relation to the consultation, including the full suite of documentation such as the SEA Environmental Report and details regarding how to make a submission, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following: www.gov.ie/en/consultation/3813e-public-consultation-on-the-draft-planning-and-development-act-2000-exempted-development-no-3-regulations-2022-and-the-draft-planning-and-development-solar-safeguarding-zone-regulations-2022-solar-exemptions/. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before the finalisation of the draft regulations. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. Accordingly, the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months.</p>  <p>  While these regulations are out for public consultation, my Department is concurrently examining the scope to draft supplementary regulations to further expand the exemptions by way of reducing the proposed solar safeguarding zones around airports.</p></reply>

While the Terms of Reference do not envisage the publication of a report or conclusion of the work by a specific timeline, proposals from this working group will be presented to the Minister upon the conclusion of its work.</p><p>I would also like to advise that to support and accelerate this work, a separate Interdepartmental Group is in place with officials from my Department engaging with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in relation to planning in Gaeltacht areas as it relates to the implementation of the above provisions in particular.</p><p>One of the key aims of this interdepartmental group is to ensure that procedures and systems will be tailored, as appropriate to facilitate an effective and consistent approach by the relevant local authorities in managing planning related issues in Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>The interdepartmental group has been examining how current practices in the application of these provisions could be strengthened in the overall interest of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht and in the interests of proper planning and sustainable development, underpinned by a policy which the Department Tourism, Culture, Arts Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is current developing. It is intended that this policy will provide the clarity and guidance needed in order to integrate the required changes to effect greater consistency and fairness in the planning system as well as providing assistance to the Local Authorities concerned. This policy is critical to the development of the Section 28 Guidelines for planning in Gaeltacht Areas which my Department will be commencing later this year.  </p><p>The most recent meeting of the interdepartmental group was held on 24<sup>th</sup>May 2022 in the offices of  the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in Na Forbacha.

The operational carbon emissions for heating, lighting and other services have been significantly reduced in Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). These NZEB regulations apply to all new buildings including social and affordable housing developments.  Currently these embodied carbon emissions are addressed in the Climate Action Plan and the Construction Products Regulation.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department has issued design guidelines for sustainable housing which includes recommendations to have due regard for the environmental impact of construction materials. These guidelines &ldquo;Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities&rdquo; are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link. www.gov.ie/en/publication/24d9e-quality-housing-for-sustainable-communities-design-guidelines/.</p>  <p>  Under the Climate Action Plan the Office of Public Works are putting in place a roadmap to promote greater use of lower-carbon building material alternatives in construction and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are carrying out a research and development project to examine life cycle analysis and embedded energy in buildings to compare the use of sustainable materials.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All the following suite of measures and relevant targets under the pathway to addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock includes:</p>  <p>  -  The establishment of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund which will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way. It is proposed that this      Fund will provide 2,000 home/sites by 2025.</p>  <p>  -  A new local authority-led programme to help Local Authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market will ensure homes don&rsquo;t lie vacant.</p>  <p>  -  A new Town Centre First policy which I launched on 4 February 2022 providing a major new policy that aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into our town centres</p>  <p>   These are supported by the prioritisation of compact growth through the National Planning Framework (NPF). </p>  <p>  Compact growth means targeting a greater proportion of development to take place in settlements of all sizes, through urban infill and the re-use of brownfield lands. Through compact growth, the NPF effectively sets out recycling rates for the reuse of brownfield land, by requiring 40% of new housing nationally, to be built within infill and brownfield lands and encourages reuse of existing building stock (50% of development in the five cities where 50% of future development is to take place and 30% elsewhere, where the other 50% of development is targeted).</p>  <p>  As an action of the Climate Action Plan, my Department is currently preparing a guidance document on &lsquo;Improving the Energy Efficiency of Traditional Buildings&rsquo;. The guidance will be aimed primarily at providing advice to retrofit specifiers and installers on fabric improvements and reducing the operational energy of existing buildings of traditional solid-walled construction. However, it will also draw attention to consideration of the full environmental impact of the works, the embodied emissions of materials used and the use of Life Cycle Assessment to calculate the total carbon footprint of a building project.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for Built and Archaeological Heritage 2019, my Department is currently exploring the feasibility of developing a Life Cycle Assessment tool specifically for existing, traditional and historic buildings.</p>  <p>   The review of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 (known as the Constructions Products Regulations or &ldquo;the CPR&rdquo;) was confirmed by the European green deal in December 2019 and the circular economy action plan in March 2020.  In parallel, the European Commission initiated discussion on an implementation plan for a future environmental life cycle assessment framework for construction products, looking at the impacts on the wider environment that occur during the whole life cycle of a construction product. The objective is to identify the strategic issues that need to be addressed with a view to the implementation of Basic Works Requirement 7 &lsquo;Sustainable Use of Natural Resources&rsquo; (BWR7) in the context of the current and the future revision to the Construction Products Regulation.</p>  <p>  Ireland will be obliged to follow this harmonised procedure via harmonised technical specifications for construction products, when a consensus of approach emerges. In that regard, it would be counter to harmonisation to develop national rules for matters covered by the Internal Market regulation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-23a.84.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062300058#WRB01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 40 and 78 together.</p><p>The Government needs to strike a balance between restricting the level of rents that tenants are paying and keeping ordinary landlords in the system.</p><p>A blanket rent freeze will simply not grow, or maintain, the supply of much needed accommodation in the rental market. It is highly likely that a blanket ban on rent increases for a significant duration would be the subject of a legal challenge and would almost certainly deter continued investment in the rental accommodation market.</p><p>Having regard to the manifest and grave risk to human life and public health posed by the spread of Covid-19 and in order to mitigate, where practicable, the effect of the spread of that disease, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provided for a temporary moratorium on tenancy terminations, other than in exceptional and limited cases during the emergency period from 27 March 2020 to 1 August 2020.</p><p>I have no plans to introduce a ban on evictions, as to do so would constitute an unjust interference in landlords constitutional property rights and could discourage landlords staying in the rental market. </p><p>The continuing increase in the numbers accessing emergency accommodation is a serious concern. The Government, local authorities, approved housing bodies (AHBs) and others are making every effort to reduce homelessness, and while significant work has been done there is still more to do.</p><p>I have established the National Homeless Action Committee, and I have asked them to prioritise the issue of homelessness prevention and to look at all further avenues of addressing this. The Committee includes representation from the local authority and Non Governmental Organisations (NGO) sector.</p><p>My Department also funds Threshold&rsquo;s National Tenancy Protection Service, which has proven to be instrumental in preventing homelessness in the first instance and supporting people to remain in their homes.</p><p>The most effective way to increase exits from homelessness in the medium to long term is to increase supply, particularly of social housing, and to accelerate supply of housing over the next decade. Under <i>Housing for All</i>, the Government&rsquo;s national housing plan to 2030, the Government is committed to providing 47,600 new-build social homes by the end of 2026, and 90,000 social homes by 2030. In terms of social housing delivery, last year, 9,183 new social homes were provided, a 17% increase on 2020.</p><p><i>Housing for All</i>provides funding and commits to delivering 36,000 affordable homes for purchase and 18,000 Cost Rental homes up to 2030. Underpinned by the Affordable Housing Act 2021, these affordable homes will be delivered through local authorities, AHBs, the Land Development Agency (LDA), the First Home shared equity scheme and the expansion of the Part V planning requirements. </p><p>Over 4,000 Affordable homes are targeted for delivery in 2022, with targets increasing incrementally in subsequent years. An average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year are targeted for delivery up to 2030. These will be delivered by AHBs, supported by the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL), the LDA and by local authorities supported by the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF). </p><p>50 purpose-built Cost Rental homes, with cost rents of &euro;1,200 per month for a two-bedroom apartment, have been tenanted by the Tuath and Respond AHBs at Enniskerry Road, in conjunction with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The tenanting and allocation process is underway for a further 123 Cost Rental homes across 4 sites in Dublin and Kildare which are due to be tenanted by the end of June. </p><p>Following the success of the Voids Programme which delivered over 6,000 units in 2020 and 2021, there is a new Voids Programme for 2022 with an emphasis on quick turnaround and re-letting of vacant social housing stock to those on social housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation.</p><p>Significant progress is already being made under <i>Housing for All</i>to accelerate supply and recent commencement figures are encouraging. In the past 12 months (June 2021 to May 2022), Commencement Notices for 30,233 new homes were received. On a rolling 12-month basis, the total number of homes for which Commencement Notices were received is 18.5% higher than the previous 12-month period of June 2020 to May 2021. All additional measures that we can take to address the rise in homelessness are being actively pursued.</p></reply>

Together with its educational and healthcare partners the agency has created high-quality living environments that embody the ideals of the New European Bauhaus. </p><p>The New European Bauhaus sets the European context and ambition for our national policy and is a constant presence in the policy report. The New European Bauhaus emphasis on spanning holistically from technology and science to creativity and culture, is inspiring, to create a future which values sustainability, inclusivity and beauty. <i>Places for People</i>can be summarised in four objectives: Sustainability; Quality; Leadership and Culture. It will be implemented under three action categories: value and empower, set a quality agenda and generate knowledge. These approaches are a good fit with the New European Bauhaus ideals. </p><p>To start the implementation process, my Department and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland jointly commissioned photographer Ros Kavanagh to make a short film. This evocative film includes an extensive interview with cultural ambassadors Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara of Grafton Architects, who recently won the EU Mies Award for contemporary architecture. The film narrates the vision of the policy by illustrating three Grafton projects, which show how we can transform our living environments by a culture of high-quality architecture which benefits people, nature and planet. The film resonates with the values of the New European Bauhaus, showing architecture that is &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo;, &lsquo;sustainable&rsquo; and brings people &lsquo;together&rsquo;. I am delighted this film was selected from open competition to be shown at the inaugural New European Bauhaus festival in Brussels from 10-12 June. </p><p>My Department is the national contact organisation for the NEB and is already engaged with the Commission, which is developing a fast-moving programme of funded initiatives. We have set up an Irish stakeholder group to respond to these NEB initiatives, participate in member state engagement with the NEB festival and grow the NEB network and collaborations in Ireland.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). </p>  <p>  In January 2022 my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focused on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p>  <p>  -  One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;</p>  <p>  -  Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and</p>  <p>  -  Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs;</p>  <p>  Local authorities were also advised that acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  In April 2022, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this  circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are: (i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter; (ii) are in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and (iii) can be completed during 2022. The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. It is a matter for individual local authorities to identify suitable acquisitions in line with local circumstances and their social housing allocations policy. </p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026.  In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority for the period 2022-2026 and in March I issued local authority targets for affordable purchase and cost-rental.  Carlow County Council has a target to deliver 80 new social homes and 5 local authority affordable purchase and cost rental homes in 2022.   </p>  <p>  A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022 - 2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All. All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans to me in December and my Department is now working closely with the local authorities to review and finalise the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. The Plans will be published by local authorities before the end of Quarter 2.  </p>  <p>  My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity by all local authorities. This data is available to the end of 2021, and is published on the Local Authority Housing Scheme Statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/. Data for Quarter 1 2022 social housing delivery is currently being collated and will be published shortly.</p></reply>

My Department does not own or manage any part of this SAC, which is owned largely by the ESB.   A management plan scoping exercise was undertaken by ESB International on behalf of the ESB in 2016/2017.

Monitoring of SACs is carried out by the NPWS on a cyclical basis. The most recent report was submitted to the EU in 2019 and is available on the NPWS website. </p>  <p>  The priority habitat &ldquo;Alluvial forests with Alder and Ash&rdquo; is one of the qualifying interests of the Gearagh SAC and a monitoring site for this habitat is located within the SAC. It was most recently surveyed during the 2017-2018 monitoring period, when the area, structure and functions, and future prospects of the habitat in SAC were all assessed as favourable. This is in contrast with the national conservation status of the Alluvial forests habitat in Ireland, which is considered to be bad, and deteriorating. </p>  <p>  The Gearagh SAC is also listed for the habitat &ldquo;Rivers with muddy banks&rdquo;. In addition to the NPWS survey, results of a 2018 botanical survey were made available to the NPWS by the ESB. The habitat was assessed as favourable in the Gearagh SAC. </p>  <p>  The NPWS continues to engage with the ESB on the monitoring of this site. The positive findings from scientific surveys are indicators of a good management regime. </p></reply>

The Government, local authorities and others are making every effort to reduce homelessness. Key to this is the delivery of new social housing and boosting overall supply.</p>  <p>  The Government is investing significantly in social and affordable housing, with record funding allocated for current and capital investment in housing this year alone. This year funding is in place to deliver 11,800 social homes, including 9,000 new build homes, thus building on the progress made last year when 9,183 new social homes were provided, a 17% increase on 2020.</p>  <p>  More specifically, I have established the National Homeless Action Committee with initial key priorities being the advancement of additional measures to prevent Homelessness and the Youth Homelessness Strategy. The Committee will meet again in early July to further advance these measures.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of local authorities in addressing homelessness at a local level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual local authorities. </p>  <p>   I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) discretion rate to 35%  and to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons for new tenancies This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are prioritising tenancy support services, prevention and the use of the Placefinder service for HAP tenancies.</p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a review of Housing Delivery Action Plans which were submitted by local authorities.  These have included specific provision for one-bed units which are critical for exits for single homeless people, and for the delivery of 4-bed units, which are key in supporting exits from homelessness for larger families. The plans will be published by local authorities before the end of Quarter 2 2022.</p>  <p>   There will be a new Voids programme for 2022 with an emphasis on quick turnaround and re-letting of vacant social housing stock. In addition, in line with the commitment in Housing for All to support local authorities to drive take up of the enhanced Repair and Leasing scheme, the Government has recently approved a pilot expansion which will open the scheme to a wider range of owners, by removing the criteria that a property owner must be unable to fund or access funding to bring former vacant commercial and institutional buildings back into use under the Repair and Leasing scheme. These measures will increase supply of homes to those on social housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  Recently, I also reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions that meet certain criteria.  This will allow local authorities more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness.</p>  <p>  We are providing more social homes, we are completing more homes in general and we have a strong pipeline of homes commenced. This supply activity, as well as targeted measures specifically centred on homelessness, will allow us to meet the challenge of eradicating homelessness. </p></reply>

The agency is currently recruiting staff to work on this project, with the project lead in place since March 2022. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is presently scoping out the legislative provisions that will be required to robustly underpin the new registration system with a view to these provisions being enacted in 2022. The online registration system is being developed, as are the necessary processes and procedures to ensure, once launched, that the register is comprehensive, accurate and up to date. </p>  <p>  The final details of the operational arrangements in relation to the new registration system - including its linkages to the online short-term letting platforms - are still being worked out. However, an underlying objective of the new system will be to ensure that an adequate level of private rental accommodation can be provided, particularly in urban areas of high housing demand, and that such accommodation is not overly diverted to the short term letting sector at the expense of local people seeking long-term rental accommodation.</p>  <p>  From the long term rental perspective, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019 specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light, fire safety and the safety of gas, oil and electrical supplies. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the regulations were amended to allow alternative requirements in cases where a house is let or available to let under a private residential tenancy agreement for a minimum lease period of 10 years.</p>  <p>  This amendment removed the requirement to furnish a rental property with white goods with the aim of encouraging landlords to offer long-term leases (minimum of 10 years) and to promote a transition to a model of longer term rental options for households.</p>  <p>  Under 'Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland', a specific action has been set for the Department of Finance to review the recommendations of the Working Group on the &lsquo;Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Landlords&rsquo; that took place in 2017. My Department, working in collaboration with the Residential Tenancies Board, will assist the Department of Finance in carrying out this review in Q3 2022. </p></reply>

One of the ways that the Government is trying to increase the supply of more affordable homes to rent under Housing for All is through the introduction of a new Cost Rental sector, the legislative framework for which was set out in the Affordable Housing Act last year. It is a long-term rental model, under which tenants only pay the cost of providing, managing and maintaining their homes.</p>  <p>  We are committed to growing this sector, and through Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), Local Authorities, and the Land Development Agency (LDA) under Project Tosaigh, approximately 1,500 Cost Rental homes are targeted for completion and tenanting this year alone. Overall, some 18,000 Cost Rental homes are targeted for completion under Housing for All to 2030.</p>  <p>  From 16 July 2021, the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 restricts any rent increase in a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of the Consumer Price (HICP). It remains the case that any rent amount set cannot exceed market rent.</p>  <p>  To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for May  2022 shows HICP inflation of 8.3% p.a.), the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs, where the inflation rate is higher. In effect, this means that rents in RPZs may only increase by a maximum of 2% per annum pro rata during times of higher inflation.</p>  <p>  The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 are kept under constant review and any necessary legislation will be introduced.  </p></reply>

Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. The Plan is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs. </p><p>Housing for All is set out across four pathways to addressing the most pressing housing challenges facing the State: <ol type="1"><li>Pathway to Supporting homeownership and Increasing Affordability</li><li>Pathway to Eradicating Homelessness, Increasing Social Housing Delivery And Supporting Social Inclusion</li><li>Pathway to Increasing New Housing Supply</li><li>Pathway to Addressing vacancy and Efficient Use of Existing Stock</li></ol>These pathways are underpinned by long-term actions to address systemic challenges. The Plan aims to create a housing system which has environmental, social and economic sustainability at its heart and which meets the needs of all.</p><p>Increasing housing supply is at the core of Housing for All. Indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident which will help increase the availability of homes across all tenures.  </p><p>This year, the Government&rsquo;s target under Housing for All is 24,600 new homes. In the 12 months to the end of March 2022, a total of 22,219 new homes were completed. In the past 12 months (June 2021 to May 2022), Commencement Notices for 30,233 new homes were received. In addition, latest CSO figures show planning permissions for all residential dwellings are up 22.7% in the year ending Q1 2022 (44,491) when compared to the same time period to Q1 2021 (36,252). Together, the figures point to a substantial uplift in new housing supply in the coming years, as we increase output to average of at least 33,000 new homes per year. This increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home. </p><p>With regard to public housing delivery, each local authority was required to prepare a Housing Delivery Action Plan, setting out details of social and housing affordable delivery in the period 2022-2026. This includes information on the locations where housing will be delivered in addition to information on the planned delivery streams.  In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority, setting out build and long-term leasing targets over the next five years.  The main focus under Housing for All is to deliver social homes through new build. In developing the Housing Delivery Action Plans, each local authority was required to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) and plan provision accordingly. The Plans are currently being reviewed by my Department and will be published before the end of Q2 2022.</p><p>My Department published the Quarter 4 2021 Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR), which provides details of social housing developments that have been completed or were under construction in each local authority at the end of 2021. The report is available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/af746-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q4-2021/ </p><p>The capacity of Local Authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects requires the resourcing of their housing services. In this regard, I have sanctioned over 250 additional Local Authority posts, which are in the process of being filled across housing delivery teams in order to deliver on Housing for All's ambition.</p><p>Affordability, for those wishing to rent or buy, is at the heart of Housing for All. </p><p>The delivery of Cost Rental homes at scale is a key affordability measure under Housing for All, with State-backed rents that are in the order of 25% below what they would be on the private market. Approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered between now and the end 2030 by Local Authorities, AHBs, and the LDA, with 1,580 such cost rental homes targeted for delivery in 2022. </p><p>To support Local Authorities in the delivery of affordable homes, the Affordable Housing Fund opened for applications from 1 September 2021. The homes that Local Authorities deliver under the Affordable Housing Fund will be sold at least 15% below open market value in respect of Affordable Purchase homes and in the order of 25% below open market value prices in respect of Cost Rental homes.</p><p>Furthermore, the Land Development Agency (LDA) has a key role in the delivery of affordable homes and has recently lodged four planning applications for projects that will, if granted planning permission, deliver over 2,300 homes. In 2022, the LDA will also see construction commence on two sites, St Kevin&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork City (delivering 265 units) and Shanganagh, Shankill in conjunction with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council (delivering 597 units, comprising 306 cost rental and 91 affordable purchase homes). Under Housing for All, 20 additional sites were designated for transfer to the LDA. These lands have the potential to deliver up to 15,000 homes and, in many cases, form part of a major revitalisation of urban centres. </p><p>The LDA has also launched &ldquo;Project Tosaigh&rdquo; aimed at unlocking land with full planning permission that is not being developed by private sector owners due to financing and other constraints, to accelerate the delivery of up to 5,000 affordable homes. The first delivery stream of this LDA initiative was launched in November 2021. Details of the homes that will be made available under Project Tosaigh will be confirmed when commercial agreements are finalised.</p><p>In addition, the &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; affordable purchase shared equity scheme will support circa 8,000 households in acquiring new homes in the private market in the years 2022 to 2026. Subject to the necessary final approvals process of all founders to the scheme, which will see the State operate the scheme in a strategic partnership with participating mortgage lenders, I anticipate that First Home will become operational in the coming weeks.  Full information, including full eligibility criteria and regional price ceilings for homes, will be available on the First Home website upon the scheme&rsquo;s launch.</p><p>Increasing the supply of housing, and delivering on our commitments in Housing for All, is the top priority for me and the Government and we have made a good start on our path towards this goal. Importantly, a comprehensive implementation and reporting framework is well established to assess how the actions under the Plan are progressing. These structures include political oversight, via the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Housing, the Housing for All Secretary General Delivery Group, and dedicated Workstreams, all of which monitor delivery of the Plan and recommend any adjustments to priorities, as required, on an ongoing basis. </p><p>Progress reports are published quarterly. The fourth of these reports, covering progress in Q2 2022 is due for publication in July. These reports can be accessed on www.gov.ie/en/collection/9d2ee-housing-for-all-quarterly-progress-reports/  .</p></reply>

The level of affordably constrained need across the county of Mayo is assessed at below 5%, although some localised affordability issues may arise in certain towns within the county.</p>  <p>  It will be a matter for the local authority to consider whether a particular requirement for affordable housing arises and whether it will bring forward specific affordable schemes to meet this need.  It is possible for local authorities, including Mayo County Council, to undertake HNDA analysis at sub county level to determine whether a need for Government funded affordable housing schemes is evident in specific towns/areas.  Affordable Housing Fund subsidy is only available to support affordable housing purchase in schemes located in large or key towns to uphold National Planning Framework objectives and to  ensure that provision is aligned with where need is concentrated.  This Department and the Housing Agency are available to assist in this regard.</p>  <p>  Where particular challenges arise for facilitating owner-occupation in towns, and where viable sites available for building of new homes are in short supply, there is significant potential for local authorities to support homeownership in these areas by making available serviced sites at a reduced cost or providing support towards the refurbishment of vacant properties where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high. A pathfinder programme will be initiated as part of a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) fund, to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders and I can confirm that all parties are working with a view to deploying the scheme in the coming weeks. It will improve access to newly-built homes, below the median price point, by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes.  This measure, targeted at first time or fresh start buyers, will allow purchasers to exit the rental market, help to build developer confidence in realisable consumer demand, and contribute to the recovery of our construction sector following the Covid-19 emergency. This Scheme will be available nationwide.</p>  <p>  Engagement is ongoing with Mayo County Council and my Department regarding the potential for development of an affordable housing scheme in Mayo.  My Department, together with the Housing Agency, has offered assistance to any local authority where they are considering developing a scheme. </p></reply>

Preparation of the Plans allowed each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly. I expect that all revised Plans will be ready for publication shortly. They will provide a comprehensive national overview of projected delivery of affordable housing.</p>  <p>  Funding is made available by Government to assist local authority and Approved Housing Body delivery of affordable housing, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), previously known as the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), and the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL).</p>  <p>  The Boherboy Road SSF project in Cork City will deliver 117 affordable purchase homes. The first two phases of 37 affordable purchase homes will be delivered in 2022. To date, SSF funding of almost &euro;5 million has been approved for this project</p>  <p>  Cork City Council have advised that they will also assist in the delivery of 36 affordable purchase homes at Cluain Chaoin in Tower this year through an advance purchase arrangement. My Department has approved funding of &euro;1,800,000 in respect of this project.</p>  <p>  My Department received an AHF application earlier this year from Cork County Council for AHF subsidy to support four housing schemes with affordable housing provision, two of which are situated in Clonakilty, with one each in Kinsale and Mallow.  Cork County Council has advised my Department that it is estimated that these schemes will be on site across 2023 and delivery will be in multiple phases from the end of 2023 to 2026.  Cork County Council will be notified of the outcome of these applications shortly.</p>  <p>  A number of CREL applications for cost rental developments in Cork are currently at various stages of funding application and approval.</p>  <p>  In terms of delivery of affordable housing in Cork by the Land Development Agency (LDA), I am happy to inform the Deputy that the development of a site at St Kevin's Hospital is currently being progressed. This 14.5 acre site is expected to deliver 119 affordable purchase and 119 Cost Rental homes. The LDA have advised my Department that enabling works will commence shortly and that the first homes are expected to be available in 2023.</p></reply>

It will see 54,000 affordable home interventions which includes 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost rental homes to be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Land Development Agency (LDA) and through &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p>  <p>  Under this strategy, approximately 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026 by AHBs, Local Authorities and the LDA.  AHBs will be supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding and Local Authorities will be able to avail of funding for Cost Rental delivery through the Affordable Housing Fund, formerly the Serviced Sites Fund. The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh. As it is the first year of most of these programmes, pipeline projections are only being developed and numbers may increase over the year as schemes get approved.</p>  <p>  To date, approval in principle has been confirmed so far for approximately 900 Cost Rental homes to be delivered by AHBs under the CREL scheme in the period to 2023. The necessary financial and commercial arrangements in relation to a number of these projects are being completed by the AHBs concerned. Full details of the projects, including specific locations, housing typologies and cost-covering rents, cannot be made public until these arrangements are concluded.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to Cost Rental housing delivery in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, 50 Cost Rental homes were tenanted in April in Woodside, Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, with rents with approximately 40% below open-market rates for comparable homes in that area. These homes were supported through the Affordable Housing Fund and were delivered in coordination between D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Tuath and Respond AHBs and the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  To date, I have made three sets of regulations that expand on the policy framework for this new sector as set out in Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act. On 19 August 2021 I made the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Designation) Regulations 2021, which came into effect that day. These Regulations govern the process by which the owners of dwellings may obtain the designation of their properties as Cost Rental dwellings. The text of these Regulations is available online at:</p>  <p>  www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/425/made/en/print.</p>  <p>  In relation to affordable purchase and the Affordable Housing Fund, any funding being made available will be underpinned by local authorities' Housing Delivery Action Plans. Local authorities submitted their initial Plans to me last December. Preparation of the Plans is allowing each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly. The Plans are being revised and updated by local authorities in the light of ongoing engagement and clarifications, and I expect that they will be ready for publication by the summer. </p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Fund provides exchequer funding support to local authorities to allow the delivery of housing at affordable prices or rents on local authority lands or via advance purchase arrangements with developers for new housing on developer-owned land.  Funding has already been approved for 6 advance purchase arrangements by local authorities to deliver almost 200 housing units in 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have signed two sets of Regulations which underpin the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, made under the provisions of Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, which came into effect on 13 April 2022. The Regulations provide the basis for the making available of affordable purchase homes by local authorities and the administration of sales.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing (No. 2) Regulations 2022 prescribe, among other things, the notification of affordable dwelling schemes to the public, the use by Local Authorities of schemes of priority, the calculation of home purchase prices and the equity shares to be taken by the Local Authority, and the minimum payment for a homeowner redeeming the Local Authority's equity interest. The text of these Regulations is available online at:</p>  <p>  www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/184/made/en/print</p>  <p>  The LDA is pursuing a twin-track approach of accelerating near term construction of affordable homes on private land, whilst continuing its work on public land. It is also over the longer term, assembling large state-owned land banks capable of delivering thousands of new homes.</p>  <p>  Details of the work that the LDA is progressing on public lands that will deliver affordable purchase and cost rental can be found here;</p>  <p>  lda.ie/projects-schemes/.</p>  <p>  In 2022, the LDA will see construction commencing on two of these sites, St Kevin&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork city (delivering 265 units) and Shanganagh, Shankill in conjunction with Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council (delivering 597 units with 306 cost rental and 91 affordable homes).</p>  <p>  Examples of further progress that has been made can be seen in the LDA&rsquo;s has recent submission of planning applications which include 344 homes in Hackettstown, Skerries, 817 homes in Castlelands, Balbriggan, 219 units in Devoy Barracks, Naas, and, in relation to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, 977 homes in Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum. </p>  <p>  In addition to the public lands that the LDA is working on, Project Tosaigh is a market engagement initiative to unlock land with full planning permission that is not being developed by private sector owners due to financing and other constraints, and use it to accelerate the supply of affordable housing. The target under Project Tosaigh is the delivery of 5,000 new homes by 2026 for affordable cost rental or sale to eligible households under affordable purchase arrangements. The first strand of Project Tosaigh involved an expressions of interest (EOI) process, launched in November 2021, to engage builders and landowners in forward purchase agreements, with the intention of securing stock in certain developments in the shorter term. Details of all homes that will be made available under Project Tosaigh will be confirmed when commercial agreements are finalised. </p>  <p>  In addition to the schemes already mentioned, Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides for the establishment of the &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; affordable purchase shared equity scheme to support purchases in the private market. The Scheme aims to support c. 8,000 households in acquiring new homes in the private market in the years 2022 to 2026.</p>  <p>  First Home will help applicants to afford new homes in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. The Scheme will primarily support First Time Buyers in the purchase of new homes within designated regional price ceilings, set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by first-time buyers in the area.</p>  <p>  Subject to the necessary final approvals process of all founders to the scheme, which will see the State operate the scheme in a strategic partnership with participating mortgage lenders, it is anticipated that First Home will become operational in the coming weeks. Full information, including full eligibility criteria and regional price ceilings for homes, will be available on the First Home website upon the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.</p>  <p>  Additional affordable housing delivery will be facilitated under the provisions of the expanded 20% Part V requirement as and when they arise, and subject to the planning process. </p>  <p>  Other measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan (formerly the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan), are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.</p>  <p>  Housing for All introduced the Local Authority Home Loan scheme as a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The new Local Authority Home Loan commenced on 4 January 2022 and has a lower interest rate and higher income eligibility than previously applied. The Local Authority Home Loan will support First-time Buyers buying new or second-hand homes, as well as self-builds. More details on the Local Authority Home Loan scheme are available on the following link    </p>  <p>  localauthorityhomeloan.ie/  </p>  <p>  The Help-to-Buy incentive supports First-time Buyers in meeting the deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home. </p></reply>

The Scheme will primarily support First Time Buyers in the purchase of new homes within designated regional price ceilings, set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by first-time buyers in the area.</p>  <p>  Subject to the necessary final approvals process of all founders to the scheme, which will see the State operate the scheme in a strategic partnership with participating mortgage lenders, it is anticipated that First Home will become operational in the coming weeks. Full information, including full eligibility criteria and regional price ceilings for homes, will be available on the First Home website upon the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026.  In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority for the period 2022-2026. My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity by all local authorities. This data is available to the end of 2021, and is published on the Local Authority Housing Scheme Statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/. Data for Quarter 1 2022 social housing delivery is currently being collated and will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  Local authorities with a strong and identified affordable housing need were asked to prepare Affordable Delivery Action Plans and were set five-year Affordable Delivery Targets.  An identified high level of affordable housing need arises where the HNDA indicates that, of the total projected need for housing in the county, over 5% of new households will not qualify for social housing but will also be constrained in accessing housing by their ability to afford to buy or rent.  The level of affordably constrained need across Mayo is assessed at below 5%, although I understand that there are some localised affordability issues arising in Westport. </p>  <p>  Where local authorities have localised affordability challenges in key towns, such as may exist in Mayo, they can still apply to my Department for funding to develop affordable housing schemes where they can demonstrate that an affordable scheme is needed to address those localised affordability challenges and they can meet the criteria for the Affordable Housing Fund. Indeed engagement is ongoing with Mayo County Council regarding the potential for development of an affordable housing scheme in Mayo.  My Department, together with the Housing Agency, has offered assistance to any local authority where they are considering developing a scheme.</p></reply>

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned. The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern and are being taken very seriously. It is important that we establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response on the best knowledge and evidence available. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at the local level.</p>  <p>  My Department has not undertaken any study seeking to quantify the death rate among persons who are homeless in the State. However, a pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board (HRB) on behalf of the Department of Health. It is hoped that the HRB will be in a position to publish the study shortly. The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, involves the review of approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts. My Department will engage with the Department of Health on completion of this study.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to support all individuals experiencing homelessness. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in doing this.</p></reply>

Housing For All contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists, through access to appropriate financing, and a specific action in relation to legislating to allow for Technological Universities (TU) to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency. I can confirm that this borrowing capability is in place.</p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, is also engaging with all the universities, including the technological universities, to explore further options which may be available to increase the availability of student accommodation, and they are being supported where necessary by officials in my Department.</p>  <p>  Much progress has been made in recent years in reforming protections for tenants in student specific accommodation. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provides for relevant obligations and rights under residential tenancies legislation to apply to tenancy and licence agreements in student-specific accommodation, provided by public educational institutions or by private accommodation providers.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 was signed into law on 9 July 2021 and limits, in respect of tenancies created on or after 9 August 2021, the amount of rent in advance (maximum of 1 month&rsquo;s rent) and/or a deposit (maximum of 1 month&rsquo;s rent) that a landlord can ask anyone, including a student, to pay to secure a tenancy. Accordingly, the maximum upfront payment can be no more than 2 months&rsquo; rent and any ongoing advance rent payment during a tenancy can only cover 1 month&rsquo;s rent. The Act greatly reduces the financial exposure to tenants, including students, on foot of paying much restricted upfront payments. </p>  <p>  The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 are kept under constant review and any necessary legislation will be introduced.</p></reply>

The role of my Department is to ensure that a framework of policy, legislation and funding is provided to ensure that housing authorities are in a position to address homelessness at a local level. I can assure the Deputy that resources and funding are not an obstacle to the urgent efforts required. Budget 2022 reflects this commitment by allocating &euro;194 million for homelessness services.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are currently severe pressures on access to emergency accommodation in Limerick City due to a variety of reasons, and I understand that Limerick City and County Council is doing everything in its power to address this. My Department has liaised and continues to liaise with Limerick City and County Council in this regard. </p>  <p>  While my Department sets the overall policy and legislative framework and provides the necessary resources, decisions on the range of homeless accommodation required, and the funding of such services are a matter for individual authorities. The administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis with a lead authority in place for each region. Limerick City and County Council is the regional lead authority for the Mid-West region, which also includes Clare County Council.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;8.2m was provided in Exchequer funding to the Mid-West Region in 2021 with over &euro;3.8m in funding recouped to date in 2022, with further payments to be made. I can assure the Deputy again that resources will not be an obstacle to the urgent efforts required.</p>  <p>  Homelessness is a complex issue, in which causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably, as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery. Therefore, a whole of Government approach is required in dealing with this challenge. This is how we are working and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  These resources facilitate local authorities to provide emergency accommodation and other essential support services to households experiencing homelessness, while also ensuring that pathways out of homelessness for those households in emergency accommodation are secured as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Services are also in place to assist households exiting homelessness into a home and work will continue to build upon the good work already being done in this area.</p></reply>

The Government, local authorities and others are making every effort to reduce homelessness. Key to this is the delivery of new social housing and boosting overall supply.</p>  <p>  The Government is investing significantly in social and affordable housing, with record funding allocated for current and capital investment in housing this year alone. This year funding is in place to deliver 11,800 social homes, including 9,000 new build homes, thus building on the progress made last year when 9,183 new social homes were provided, a 17% increase on 2020.</p>  <p>  More specifically, I have established the National Homeless Action Committee with initial key priorities being the advancement of additional measures to prevent Homelessness and the Youth Homelessness Strategy. The Committee will meet again in early July to further advance these measures.</p>  <p>  I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) discretion rate to 35% and to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons for new tenancies.  This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are prioritising tenancy support services, prevention and the use of the Placefinder service for HAP tenancies.</p>  <p>  My Department has undertaken a review of Housing Delivery Action Plans which were submitted by local authorities.  These have included specific provision for one-bed units which are critical for exits for single homeless people, and for the delivery of 4-bed units, which are key in supporting exits from homelessness for larger families. The plans will be published by local authorities before the end of Quarter 2 2022.</p>  <p>  There will be a new Voids programme for 2022 with an emphasis on quick turnaround and re-letting of vacant social housing stock. In addition, in line with the commitment in Housing for All to support local authorities to drive take up of the enhanced Repair and Leasing scheme, the Government has recently approved a pilot expansion which will open the scheme to a wider range of owners, by removing the criteria that a property owner must be unable to fund or access funding to bring former vacant commercial and institutional buildings back into use under the Repair and Leasing scheme. These measures will increase supply of homes to those on social housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  Recently, I also reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions that meet certain criteria.  This will allow local authorities more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness.</p>  <p>  My Department has approved the re-introduction of the Place Finder fee incentive by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. This will be payable where suitable properties are made exclusively available to homeless families through the DRHE Place Finders team and not advertised on letting websites or elsewhere. </p>  <p>  We are providing more social homes, we are completing more homes in general and we have a strong pipeline of homes commenced. This supply activity, as well as targeted measures specifically centred on homelessness, will allow us to meet the challenge of eradicating homelessness.</p></reply>

Tackling the issues related to land use and environmental rights in Colombia forms a key element of Colombia&rsquo;s peace process.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the situation and the recent report referred to by the Deputies in relation to the Cauca region of Colombia.</p>  <p>  The situation in this region, as with many other rural regions in Colombia, is highly complex. Ireland has been actively engaged with all parties with a view to understanding the situation and promoting an inclusive, meaningful dialogue through which the issues may be resolved.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with representatives of the community and the NGOs mentioned, with the company involved, and with the Government in Colombia on this issue. Officials in my Department met with SumOfUs, the Latin America Solidarity Centre, and an Indigenous leader from the Misak community last month to learn more about their concerns. Our Embassy in Bogota has spoken to the company and has visited the relevant areas of the Cauca region, meeting with local communities and visiting the land in question. The Embassy is due to meet representatives of the Misak community later this month.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has engaged with the Colombian Government to support a process of dialogue between the authorities, the Misak community and the company to resolve their differences. I understand that the Colombian authorities have subsequently organised meetings with the company and local communities.</p>  <p>  We continue to urge the parties concerned to engage in dialogue, to come to an understanding regarding the issues at hand in order to resolve their differences, and if necessary to pursue the relevant legal means to address their concerns. The Department remains open to supporting activities and engagement that will facilitate such dialogue.</p></reply>

Scaled up finance will require quick and agile finance flows, based on equity and human rights, which requires us to bring experience from humanitarian and development assistance.</p>  <p>  The Glasgow Dialogue was established at the UNFCCC negotiations in 2021 to discuss funding arrangements on Loss and Damage, further to the specific request by developing countries that a new finance facility under the UNFCCC be established. Ireland believes that the Glasgow Dialogue will be key to identifying the most efficient and effective ways to respond to the urgent needs of countries most affected by climate change.</p>  <p>  Ireland is participating fully in, and informing, the Glasgow Dialogue as part of the EU team. Ireland has also shown leadership by proactively bringing in civil society, humanitarian actors, women, youth and indigenous peoples to influence the Dialogue, and by organising a technical roundtable in May. These initiatives helped to set the stage for the first Glasgow Dialogue meeting which took place in Bonn earlier this month.</p>  <p>In addition to our role in the Glasgow Dialogue, my officials work within the EU team on the negotiations to establish the Santiago Network which will provide technical assistance for Loss and Damage. More broadly Ireland plays a leading role on Loss and Damage in development and humanitarian policy fora.   </p></reply>

The General Affairs Council this week took the opportunity to reiterate the full support of Member States for the Commission&rsquo;s approach. </p>  <p>  The tabling of this legislation marks a particular low point in the UK government approach to Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Brexit, and in particular the hard Brexit chosen by the UK Government, is the root cause of the uncertainty in Northern Ireland. The Protocol is the solution, jointly designed and freely chosen by the British Government to mitigate the challenges posed by their preferred version of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The situation on the ground backs this up. Northern Ireland is growing faster than any other UK region, according to the UK&rsquo;s own Office of National Statistics. The Protocol is a factor in helping protect Northern Ireland from negative effects of shortages and delays, as Northern Irish supply chains have added resilience thanks to its EU Single Market access. Foreign direct investment interest in Northern Ireland is at historically high levels. Northern Irish-based businesses consistently underline the importance of dual market access.</p>  <p>  The message I hear from business in Northern Ireland has been consistent. There is a real desire to make the most of the opportunities the Protocol brings. They want continued access to both the EU and GB markets. They want predictability and stability.  The UK Government&rsquo;s unilateral actions undermine these objectives and create uncertainty for Northern Ireland businesses, as well as for their suppliers and buyers. </p>  <p>  People and business across Northern Ireland have been clear: they want an agreed solution between the EU and the UK. They want the EU and the UK to work together to address the genuine concerns that have been raised. </p>  <p>  A majority of newly elected Assembly MLAs have written to Prime Minister Johnson rejecting in the strongest possible terms the UK government&rsquo;s reckless approach, as it, and I quote, &ldquo;flies in the face of the expressed wishes of not just most businesses, but most people in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Commission Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic, and his team have done commendable work engaging and listening to people and businesses in Northern Ireland. They have come up with practical and flexible means of implementing the Protocol that can address some of the real-world concerns that have arisen in relation to the movement of goods, and for enhancing Northern Ireland engagement around the Protocol. </p>  <p>  These are bespoke arrangements that further demonstrates the flexibility and compromise the EU is willing to show - including an openness to further change its own rules.  And importantly, the EU&rsquo;s approach is not a take it or leave it one.  The EU is willing to discuss these solutions with the British government.</p>  <p>  However, the UK has not engaged in any meaningful discussions since February. Their unwillingness to explore the EU&rsquo;s solutions in any real depth &ndash; taken together with their newly proposed unilateral legislation action &ndash; is the very disappointing and concerning. </p>  <p>  I have said many times that these issues can be resolved if there is political will to tackle the issues together. </p>  <p>  The UK Government continues to state that a negotiated solution is their preferred outcome. If that is true, the UK needs to demonstrate a show of good faith soon to avoid more polarisation on the ground in Northern Ireland and more harm to relationships between our two governments and between the EU and the UK.</p></reply>

The Bill proposes to disapply much of the Protocol without the agreement of the EU, including elements in relation to the movement of goods, VAT, excise and state aid, and the role of the European Court of Justice. </p>  <p>  International agreements, such as the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol, cannot simply be rewritten by one party to the agreement. Yet this is what the UK Government propose. Their approach is wholly inconsistent with international law. </p>  <p>  In its published &lsquo;Legal Position&rsquo;, the UK Government asserted that the doctrine of necessity can be invoked to lawfully justify non-performance of their international obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol. </p>  <p>  Necessity as a legal justification for non-performance of an international obligation is an institution of customary international law now codified by the United Nations International Law Commission in Article 25 of its Draft Articles on State Responsibility. This provides that necessity may only be invoked when it is the only way to safeguard an essential interest of the state concerned against a grave and imminent peril, and when it does not seriously impair an essential interest of the party to which the obligation is owed, or of the international community as a whole. Furthermore, it clarifies that necessity may only be invoked when there is no other remedy available, and that it may not be invoked by a state if the state has contributed to the situation of necessity. </p>  <p>  The British government&rsquo;s decision to table a Bill that sets aside international law and ignores the majority in Northern Ireland is deeply disappointing. The approach has been widely criticised by people and business in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  I am in ongoing contact with our partners across the EU, including European Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic.  The EU&rsquo;s remains deeply committed to Northern Ireland.  Opposition to the UK&rsquo;s unilateral action is uniform across the Union and support for the Commission approach remains steadfast.  This was made clear again during discussions at this week&rsquo;s General Affairs Council.  </p>  <p>  Despite the tabling of this legislation, the EU remains open to talks on finding durable and sustainable solutions.  With political will, solutions can be found to the genuine issues of concern to people and business in Northern Ireland.  Finding these solutions will allow Northern Ireland to experience in full the positive effects the Protocol can have on trade, investment, growth and employment.</p>  <p>  I continue to urge the British Government to step back from their unilateral approach and to pursue a path of constructive engagement with the European Union to resolve the outstanding issues under the Protocol.</p></reply>

It protects North South cooperation and the all-island economy, the gains of the peace process which benefit communities North and South, and ensures &lsquo;no diminution of rights, safeguards, or equality of opportunity&rsquo; as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  </p>  <p>  The fundamental purpose of the Protocol is to protect the Good Friday Agreement. Arguing that the Protocol and the Good Friday Agreement are incompatible is disingenuous and irresponsible. Taken together, they are a powerful expression of what negotiation and partnership can achieve.</p>  <p>  It is Brexit, and in particular the type of hard Brexit pursued by the British Government, that is the major impediment to the free flow of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU has always been, and remains, committed to the smoothest possible implementation of the Protocol but this is only possible with cooperation from the British Government. </p>  <p>  I maintain regular and ongoing contact with my British Government counterparts, including Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, with regard to the Protocol. I also maintain ongoing contact with the parties and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland, as well as with Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic, EU counterparts, and a range of US partners.  </p>  <p>  In contacts with the British Government, I have consistently set out the Irish Government&rsquo;s deep disappointment at their decision to table legislation that would empower UK Ministers to unilaterally disapply core parts of the Protocol. Such unilateral action would, if enacted, breach international law. It damages relationships within Northern Ireland, across our islands, between our governments, and between the UK and the EU. </p>  <p>  I underlined that people in Northern Ireland do not support this legislation. We have seen that 52 MLAs have written to Prime Minister Johnson expressing &ldquo;in the strongest possible terms&rdquo; their objection to it. Northern Ireland business is clear that they need certainty and stability and that this requires a negotiated settlement. </p>  <p>  Both the Irish Government and European Commission have engaged consistently with Northern Ireland stakeholders, including the Unionist community, to understand their concerns. In October, the Commission presented proposals directly addressing these concerns, but the UK has not seriously engaged with them. Last week, in addition to relaunching infringement proceedings following the UK&rsquo;s actions on the Protocol, the Commission outlined further detail on these proposals. We fully support the EU&rsquo;s calm, measured and firm approach. </p>  <p>  Only joint solutions can provide the long-term legal certainty and predictability which people and business in Northern Ireland need. The UK needs to reciprocate the flexibility shown by the EU. I urge the British Government to step away from the path it has chosen and engage constructively with the EU.</p></reply>

At the meeting, we discussed a broad range of issues including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, the legacy of the Troubles, and the impact of recent British Government decisions on Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I underlined the Irish Government&rsquo;s deep disappointment at the British Government&rsquo;s intention to table legislation which would allow British ministers to unilaterally dis-apply elements of the Protocol. Such unilateral action would represent a serious breach of international law.

I expressed my very real concerns with both the process and substance of the draft legislation that has been introduced.

We continue to highlight the need for protection for media workers across the world, both at the UN Security Council, and at the UN Human Rights Council, as well as through our participation in intergovernmental alliances dedicated to media freedom and the protection of journalists.</p>  <p>  The brutal murder of journalist Veronica Guerin by organised crime networks in 1994 as well as the much more recent killings of Lyra McKee, Martin O&rsquo;Hagan, Simon Cumbers and Pierre Zakrzewski remind us that we cannot afford to take press freedom for granted at home or abroad.</p>  <p>  Last month, Ireland convened a special meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the protection of journalists in response to the murder of Palestinian-American journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, in Jenin on the 11 May. Ireland invited a number of prominent experts to brief Council members on the situation facing journalists including representatives from the Committee to Protect Journalists; Agence France Pressee; Al Jazeera; as well as the UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression.</p>  <p>  The war on Ukraine has had a dramatic impact on press freedom. At least nine media workers have lost their lives since 24 February including Irish citizen and journalist, Pierre Zakrzewski along with his Ukrainian colleague and journalist, Ms Oleksandra Kuvshynova who were killed by Russian forces on 14 March. In April, Ireland contributed funding to the International Federation of Journalists which helps to provide helmets, flak jackets, secure communication tools, medical supplies and safety training to allow journalists carry out their indispensable work on the frontlines.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a founding member of the Freedom Online Coalition and recently joined the Media Freedom Coalition. Ireland recently announced its candidacy for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council 2027-2029, where we will build further on our work in support of journalists and media freedom worldwide.</p></reply>

Ireland strongly supports the Commission's recommendation. If endorsed by the European Council, it will place Ukraine on a firm path towards EU membership, where it belongs. </p>  <p>  As the Opinion states, the aspiration to belong to the European Union has for many years been an important priority for Ukraine, its governments and citizens. It has been an underlying motive for democratic changes over the past decade and a driver of a number of key reforms founded on European values.</p>  <p>  Every sovereign country has a right to determine its own future, free from external pressure and duress. The people of Ukraine have chosen a future in the European Union and they deserve our full support.</p>  <p>  Ireland has long advocated for this outcome and I strongly supported Ukraine's EU perspective at Foreign Affairs Council this week. As I re-iterated when I met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba in April, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership. We have come together with a group of other Member States, with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.</p>  <p>  The European Commission Opinion will provide an important signal to the people and Government of Ukraine who have stood firm in defence of our shared European values in the face of the Russia's appalling war of aggression against them. It is a message that Europe stands with them now, that we will continue to stand with in the future, and that we will support the rebuilding of Ukraine.</p></reply>

I am clear on this in my engagement with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, our commitment is to recognise a State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement to the conflict, or when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-state solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory. In the absence of progress towards a two-state solution, I would be prepared to recommend to the Government recognition by Ireland of a State of Palestine, if and when it might be helpful, and this is a matter which I discuss regularly with EU colleagues. </p>  <p>  If recognition by Ireland happened outside the context of an overall peace agreement, this would be likely to have an adverse effect on Ireland&rsquo;s influence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at EU and international level. The timing and context of any such decision would affect whether such a loss of influence would be matched by a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people and a positive impact on the peace process and a two-state solution.</p></reply>

Open lines of communication facilitate diplomacy, which is more important than ever in a conflict situation. Communication with the Ambassador of the Russian Federation in Ireland also allows us to continue to directly convey our strong opposition to their war of aggression against Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, diplomatic engagement helps us to better protect Ireland's interests, and to protect our citizens - both in Russia itself, and the five central Asian republics for which Ireland is represented by our Embassy in Moscow.</p>  <p>  Finally, we need to consider our actions within the context of the wider EU response. Like all of our other responses during this crisis, we are coordinating closely with EU Member States and like minded partners.</p></reply>

Ireland engages actively in monthly Security Council meetings on the situation in the Middle East, which focus on the Palestinian question.</p>  <p>  On 24 June, Ireland will co-chair with Mexico, a meeting of the UN Security Council&rsquo;s Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security. This will discuss, for the first time, the situation of women in the occupied Palestinian territory. The meeting will also examine participation of Palestinian women in conflict prevention, peacebuilding, internal reconciliation efforts and post-conflict reconstruction efforts.</p>  <p>  Following the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh, Ireland organised an Arria-Formula meeting at the UN Security Council on 24 May on the protection of journalists. Ireland stressed that peace and security, freedom of expression and a free and independent press are inextricably linked, and again called for an independent investigation into Ms Abu Akleh&rsquo;s killing and for the perpetrators to be held to account.</p>  <p>  At the most recent monthly Council meeting on the Middle East on 26 May, Ireland raised the issue of illegal settlement expansion, condemning the recent decision of the Israeli authorities to advance plans for the construction of more than 4,000 housing units in the West Bank and urging Israel to reverse this decision. Ireland also expressed concern regarding developments in Masafer Yatta, urging Israel to cease evictions and demolitions, including of donor-funded structures, in line with its obligations under international humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  Following the Council meeting on 26 May, Ireland issued a joint media statement, along with France, Estonia and Albania, which strongly reiterated our position on these issues. </p>  <p>  As part of our role on the UN Security Council, Ireland engages actively with regional partners in relation to the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory. I travelled to Jordan on 1-2 June, where I met with the Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, en marge of the EU-Jordan Association Council. I also met with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, on 19 June and our discussion focused on the situation in the Gaza Strip.</p>  <p>  The overall human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory remains a key priority for me as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Ireland will continue to take every opportunity to stress the need for respect for human rights and full accountability, in particular in our role as a member of the UN Security Council. I remain committed to working with partners to promote coherent and effective EU and UN action towards a lasting and peaceful two-State solution.</p></reply>

Over 623,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022. This is 105,000 more passports than were issued at this point of the year in 2019. In the past four weeks, the Passport Service has issued an average of 30,000 passports per week.</p><p>99% of all child and adult online renewal applications are issued within the standard turnaround time and almost half of all adults who renew their passports online will receive their new passport in the post within 2 working days.</p><p>Processing time for first time applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In the space of three months, processing time for first-time applications has been reduced by almost 40%.</p><p>My Department has been proactively planning for this significant increase in demand for many months and have made an unprecedented investment in the staffing and resources necessary to meet this demand.</p><p>A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway since 2021. In addition, the Passport Service has run its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs).  The Department has also been working with the HSE to provide opportunities to contact tracing staff to transfer to the Passport Service. As of 20 June, these staff have begun to be assigned to the Customer Service Hub, which will further increase the number of staff answering customer queries. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the Passport Service to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the Passport Service in June of last year.</p><p>The information requested by Deputy Smyth is outlined below in tabular form, for online applications. It is not possible for the Passport Service to provide the requested figures in respect of paper-based applications. The tables also break down the number of applications currently in the system that are being processed by the Passport Service, and the number that are awaiting further action by the applicant. </p><p><b>Passports for adults (first time and renewals) to date in 2022:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>No. of adult applications received to date in 2022</th>       <th>No. of adult passports <br /><br />issued to date in 2022</th>       <th>No. of adult applications <br /><br />currently in the system</th>       <th>Passport Service processing</th>       <th>Awaiting further action from the applicant</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>4,264</td>       <td>3,924</td>       <td>439</td>       <td>313</td>       <td>126</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>3,492</td>       <td>3,238</td>       <td>350</td>       <td>266</td>       <td>84</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>8,541</td>       <td>7,982</td>       <td>742</td>       <td>549</td>       <td>193</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>12,688</td>       <td>12,019</td>       <td>984</td>       <td>741</td>       <td>243</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>First time passports for children to date in 2022:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>No. of first time child applications received to date in 2022</th>       <th>No. of first time child passports issued to date in 2022</th>       <th>No. of first time child applications currently in the system</th>       <th>Passport Service processing</th>       <th>Awaiting further action from the applicant</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>864</td>       <td>570</td>       <td>373</td>       <td>206</td>       <td>167</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>775</td>       <td>525</td>       <td>298</td>       <td>175</td>       <td>123</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>1,674</td>       <td>1,206</td>       <td>667</td>       <td>362</td>       <td>305</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>2,829</td>       <td>2,196</td>       <td>977</td>       <td>533</td>       <td>444</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The information requested by Deputy Moynihan and Deputy Cowen is outlined below in tabular form, for online applications.

I welcome President-elect Petro&rsquo;s indications that he will support the continued implementation of the Agreement. Ireland, together with our EU partners and other international community partners, will continue to work with all stakeholders to highlight the importance of comprehensive implementation of the Peace Agreement and to support the new administration in addressing the remaining issues.</p>  <p>  Since the signing of the Agreement in 2016, Ireland has provided just under &euro;17 million in funding towards its implementation. We were founding members of both the EU and UN Trust Funds for peace, and have engaged in a Lesson Sharing Programme with Colombia around peacebuilding in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s seat on the UN Security Council has allowed us to deepen our engagement. In our statements to the Council, Ireland has consistently called for comprehensive implementation of the Agreement, recognising the significant advances that have been made. We have expressed concern about ongoing violence, particularly against social leaders, human rights defenders and former combatants, and called for the implementation of the Agreement&rsquo;s provisions on gender and ethnicity as well as the use of all spaces for dialogue established by the Agreement.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also been a strong supporter of the transitional-justice system. With crucial milestones ahead this year, we will continue to use our voice on the Security Council to encourage the international community to play its important supportive role. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s recently launched Strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean contains a firm commitment to continue this support for the Colombian peace process in the long term.</p></reply>

I welcome these additions, and underline that the report should be released promptly and as a matter of priority.  </p>  <p>  Following the High Commissioner's update to the Human Rights Council, we are now assessing the outcome of the visit and are carefully considering the follow on actions proposed. Ireland&rsquo;s strongly supports the Office of the High Commissioner, and the independence of her Office.</p>  <p>  At the most recent Human Rights Council in June 2022, Ireland delivered a national statement that included a call on the Chinese authorities to respect international law, in particular in Xinjiang and Tibet. Ireland also joined a Joint Statement on China, along with 46 other countries and led by The Netherlands, which expressed grave concern about the human rights situations in Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation in China, including in Xinjiang. Together with our EU partners,  we will engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora to address our concerns. Ireland also encourages the early convening of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, as discussed at the April EU-China Summit. </p></reply>

It is the seventh time Ireland has held the Presidency and, in light of the war in Ukraine, a particularly important occasion to be at the helm of our continent&rsquo;s leading human rights body.</p>  <p>  The Council of Europe was the first multilateral organisation to expel the Russian Federation, following its unprovoked assault on Ukraine. In the wake of that unprecedented but essential step, the overarching goal of our Presidency term is to renew what we consider &lsquo;&lsquo;the conscience of Europe&rsquo;&rsquo;, ensuring the institution does all it can to support democracy, human rights, and rule of law in Ukraine and to hold Russian authorities to account.</p>  <p>  Within this framework, we have three particular priorities. First, as one of the Council&rsquo;s founding state, we aim to reaffirm its &lsquo;Founding Freedoms&rsquo;, protecting human rights across the continent, above all through the effective functioning of the European Court of Human Rights. Second, in the face of rising illiberalism, we have set out to promote deliberative democracy and youth participation in the democratic processes, drawing on our experience with Citizens Assemblies. Finally, under the rubric of 'F&aacute;ilte', we will strive to foster a Europe of welcome, inclusion, and diversity, building on the social change Ireland has experienced since we last held the Presidency in 2000. </p>  <p>  We are backing these priorities through clear financial commitments, significantly increasing our voluntary contributions to the Council across a range of projects, including supporting the work of the European Court of Human Rights, the Council&rsquo;s revised Action Plan for Ukraine and its world-leading efforts to combat child sexual exploitation and eliminate all forms of gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  We have also developed an extensive programme of engagement, with regular high-level visits to and from Strasbourg. On 7 June, the Taoiseach met leaders across the Council and called on the European Court of Human Rights to stress our commitment to the institution. I addressed the Council&rsquo;s Parliamentary Assembly earlier this week, sharing a platform with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the Belarusian democratic movement. Minister Byrne will return to Strasbourg next week to address the Committee of Ministers&rsquo; Deputies, with other visits planned for the autumn. </p>  <p>  Here in Ireland, we have already hosted two major Presidency forums on democratic engagement, in UCC and DCU respectively, as well as meetings of the Assembly&rsquo;s Standing Committee and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. A dozen other conferences are planned for the months ahead, of which three warrant special mention. In July, Minister Donohoe and I host the annual meeting of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Development Bank, which will focus on scaling the Bank&rsquo;s support for Ukraine. In September, Minister McEntee will invite the Council&rsquo;s 46 Justice Ministers to Dublin Castle to enhance our collective efforts to combat Domestic, Sexual &amp;amp; Gender-Based Violence across the continent. November will see Minister Brophy chair the European Conference on Global Education, where Member States will adopt a Dublin Declaration on how, through Global Education, we can build societal commitment to greater justice, sustainability, equity and human rights.</p>  <p>Our agenda is ambitious, but necessarily so, and complements our efforts at the UN Security Council, within the EU and across other multilateral fora to do all we can to support Ukraine and reinforce the values of democracy, human rights and rule of law which the Council of Europe embodies.</p></reply>

These have taken the form of six packages from 23 February 2022 to date, comprising individual measures targeting persons and entities, and sectoral measures targeting specific economic sectors or industries. </p>  <p>  Individual sanctions now apply to a total of 1,158 individuals and 98 entities in Russia and Belarus. Sectoral sanctions target the financial, energy, technology, defence and transport sectors, and Russian media involved in propaganda. The sale of EU luxury goods to Russia is prohibited, as is the import from Russia and Belarus of certain products. Restrictions have also been introduced on economic relations between the EU and the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. </p>  <p>  These sanctions aim to incentivise a change in behaviour in Moscow. They impose clear economic and political costs on the individuals and entities responsible for the invasion or benefitting from it. They also deprive Russia of the means and capabilities to wage this unjust war.</p>  <p>  In designing its successive sanctions packages, the EU has been cognisant at all times of the need to ensure that specific measures have a greater impact on Russia than on EU Member States and are sustainable. There is broad support at EU level to continue to examine options for further sanctions measures. I expect new proposals to be presented by the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) in due course.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been consistent in advocating for a maximalist approach to sanctions since the start of the war.

Over 623,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022. This is 105,000 more passports than were issued at this point of the year in 2019. In the past four weeks, the Passport Service has issued an average of 30,000 passports per week.</p>  <p>  99% of all child and adult online renewal applications are issued within the standard turnaround time and almost half of all adults who renew their passports online will receive their new passport in the post within 2 working days. </p>  <p>  Processing time for first time applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In the space of three months, processing time for first-time applications has been reduced by almost 40%. </p>  <p>  My Department has been proactively planning for this significant increase in demand for many months and have made an unprecedented investment in the staffing and resources necessary to meet this demand.</p>  <p>  A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway since 2021. In addition, the Passport Service has run its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs).  The Department has also been working with the HSE to provide opportunities to contact tracing staff to transfer to the Passport Service. As of 20 June, these staff have begun to be assigned to the Customer Service Hub, which will further increase the number of staff answering customer queries. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers at the Passport Service to over 900 which represents double the number of staff with the Passport Service in June of last year.</p>  <p>  Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified.  This new system assists in reducing the number of applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service continues to see a steady, but increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is a unified service composed of three constituent offices located in Lower Mount Street and Balbriggan in Dublin and South Mall in Cork, respectively. Passport applications from all citizens - whether from anywhere in Ireland, North or South, or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.</p>  <p>  87% of passport applications from Northern Ireland are submitted online. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.</p>  <p>  A paper-based, mail-in service is available at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the postal application channel, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. Passport Service figures show that less than 1% of all applicants use the in-person Urgent Appointment Service available at the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork. </p>  <p>Given the high percentage of applicants from Northern Ireland using Passport Online, I am confident that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.  </p></reply>

I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Israeli High Court to uphold the eviction order for Palestinians in Masafer Yatta in the West Bank and the confirmation of the designation of the land as a firing zone for the Israeli military. I note the recent injunction at the Israeli Supreme Court with reference to planned demolitions at Khallet Athaba&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  On 13 May Ireland along with fourteen other European countries, issued a statement urging the Israeli authorities not to proceed with these evictions. Ireland will continue to work with our international partners locally to emphasise our concerns to Israel, including in close coordination with our partners in the West Bank Protection Consortium. Ireland consistently raises the issue of evictions and demolitions in engagements with Israel at both official and political level.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been proactive in ensuring that this issue is highlighted at the UN Security Council, including at the most recent Council meeting on the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, on 26 May. Ireland again called on Israel to cease evictions and demolitions, including of donor-funded structures, in line with its obligations under international humanitarian law. Ireland reiterated this in a joint statement to the media following the Security Council meeting along with France, Albania and Estonia. </p>  <p>  I have expressed my serious concern on the matter of the designation of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations by Israel. This decision includes organisations in receipt of support from Irish Aid and the EU. Ireland continues to work closely with our EU partners on the issue. Ireland is fully committed to funding civil society organisations and human rights defenders in Palestine as a key part of our support for the Palestinian people</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support Palestinian civil society organisations and human rights defenders and the critical role they play in promoting international law, peace, human rights and democratic values. </p></reply>

We have also sought to use our role on the UN Security Council to champion hunger, including through our role as penholder on the Conflict and Hunger file.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s interventions are informed by a focus on governance and rights, including support for the essential work of human rights defenders through our diplomacy and through the Irish Aid programme. I attach priority to championing the prevention of, and responses to, gender-based violence, including at the Human Rights Council and on the Security Council.  </p></reply>

I also maintain ongoing contact with the parties and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland, as well as with Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic, EU counterparts, and a range of US partners.  </p>  <p>  In contacts with the British Government, including with FS Truss, I have underlined the Irish Government&rsquo;s deep disappointment at their decision to table legislation to unilaterally disapply parts of the Protocol. Such unilateral action would, if enacted, breach international law. It damages relationships within Northern Ireland, across our islands, between our governments, and between the UK and the EU. </p>  <p>  I underlined that people in Northern Ireland do not support this legislation. We have seen that 52 MLAs have written to PM Johnson expressing &ldquo;in the strongest possible terms&rdquo; their objection to it. Northern Ireland business is clear that they need certainty and stability and that this requires a negotiated settlement. </p>  <p>  Both the Irish Government and European Commission have engaged consistently with Northern Ireland stakeholders, including the Unionist community, to understand their concerns. In October, the Commission presented proposals directly addressing these concerns, but the UK has not seriously engaged with them. Last week, in addition to relaunching infringement proceedings following the UK&rsquo;s actions on the Protocol, the Commission outlined further detail for these proposals. </p>  <p>  Only joint solutions can provide long-term legal certainty and predictability to Northern Ireland. The UK needs to reciprocate the flexibility shown by the EU. I strongly urge the British Government to engage constructively with the EU.</p></reply>

The Court was established in 2002 with the entry into force of the Rome Statute.  By its very existence the Court not only promotes and upholds the rule of law but also provides a means of bringing to account the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. In this way it contributes in a fundamental way to the cause of international peace and justice. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been, and continues to be, a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC. We will continue to publicly support and promote the Court in all relevant international fora, including throughout the remainder of our term on the United Nations Security Council.   </p>  <p>  In addition to political support for the Court, Ireland strongly believes that the ICC should have sufficient resources to deliver its unique and important mandate. The ICC is funded mainly by means of annual assessed contributions made by the States Parties to the Rome Statute, determined every year at the Assembly of States Parties.  The total annual budget of the Court for 2022 is just under &euro;155 million, of which Ireland&rsquo;s assessed contribution is approximately &euro;1.2 million.  Ireland has consistently promoted a budget for the Court that is sufficient to meet the many demands placed upon it, and the recently commenced investigation into the situation in Ukraine will considerably increase those demands over the coming years. </p>  <p>  Some of the Court&rsquo;s work is also supported by voluntary trust funds established for specific purposes.  These include the Trust Fund for Victims and the Office of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Advanced Technology and Specialized Capacity.   </p>  <p>  The Government believes that supporting victims is a critical part of implementing the Rome Statute and ensuring accountability. The ICC&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Victims was established to respond to the harm resulting from the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.  Since 2004 Ireland has contributed approximately &euro;1.8 million to this trust fund and I plan to make more available shortly.  To this end, during my recent trip to Kyiv and Bucha in Ukraine, I announced that the Government will make an additional voluntary contribution of &euro;3 million to the ICC, &euro;1 million of which has now been distributed to the Office of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s Trust Fund. This funding will benefit the Prosecutor&rsquo;s work in all situation countries, not just Ukraine. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to supporting the vital work of the ICC and will continue to work with other countries around the world to promote and strengthen it.</p></reply>

It has encompassed political, financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support, as well as welcoming millions of Ukrainian refugees under the Temporary Protection Mechanism and the imposition of the most extensive package of sanctions, in response to Russia's aggression, that have ever been adopted. </p>  <p>  On 17 June the European Commission recommended that Ukraine be granted candidate status, on the understanding that certain steps are taken. Ireland strongly supports this recommendation. </p>  <p>  The recommendation will provide a strong signal to the people and Government of Ukraine who have stood firm in defence of our shared European values in the face of the most appalling Russian war. It is a message that Europe stands with them now and in the future, and will support the rebuilding of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  On sanctions, Ireland has been consistent in advocating for a maximalist approach since the start of the war. Following adoption of the sixth sanctions package on 3 June, it is likely that Member States will look at options for further sanctions package in the coming weeks and months. The sanctions adopted so far are the most extensive in the history of the EU and it is increasingly difficult to identify measures that impact Russia more than they impact EU Member States. However, EU Member States will continue to work on options, with the aim of incentivising Russia to find a political solution to the conflict, and of depriving Russia of the means and capabilities to wage this unjust war. </p>  <p>  The EU agreed a fourth package of support to Ukraine&rsquo;s military under the European Peace Facility at the end of May. Ireland will contribute &euro;44 million (towards non-lethal elements only) of the &euro;2 billion provided under the four packages. The possibility of providing a further package of military support is likely to be discussed in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has disbursed &euro;1.2 billion of emergency Macro-Financial Assistance to Ukraine. The 30 May European Council conclusions state that the European Union is ready to grant Ukraine new exceptional macro-financial assistance of up to &euro;9 billion in 2022, and invites examination of Commission proposals for this funding. The European Commission has also allocated &euro;243 million in humanitarian assistance (&euro;230m for Ukraine and &euro;13m for Moldova). </p>  <p>  EU Member States have remained united in support of Ukraine throughout Russia's war of aggression and I expect this unity of purpose will continue in the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-23a.354.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062300063#WRG01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141, 153 and 158 together.</p><p>Passport applicants can track the status of their passport application online via the Passport Tracker which is available on my Department's website - www.dfa.ie/passporttracking/. The information available on the tracker has recently been upgraded and is an excellent guide as to where an application is in the system.</p><p>The online Passport Tracker tool provides applicants with an indication of how their application is progressing through the system and gives an estimated issue date based on the current average application processing time. The tracker is updated every two hours between 7am and 7pm.</p><p>When tracking their application using the online tracker tool, applicants will receive updates that relate to the current status of their application, such as:</p><p>- Application has been received.</p><p>- Application has been received. Applicant must submit supporting documents to proceed with the application.</p><p>- Supporting documents have been received and are being verified.</p><p>- Application is being processed</p><p>- There is a problem with the application. An email has been sent to the applicant.</p><p>- Passport is being printed.</p><p>- Passport has been dispatched. </p><p>The &ldquo;processing application&rdquo; stage on the Tracker covers the period of time from when supporting documents have been received and verified by the Passport Service until the application is approved. During some of that period the application is in a queue waiting to be reviewed.</p><p>On one occasion last week, the Passport Service experienced technical issues with the Tracker resulting in online applications not being registered on the Tracker for up to 24 hours. These issues have now been resolved and the Tracker is operating as normal. </p><p>The vast majority of passports are issued earlier than the estimated issue by-date.  The Passport Service prioritises any applications that have exceeded their estimated issue-by date. It is important to note that the issue-by date is an estimate based on current average processing times and that it is not a service delivery guarantee. </p><p>The Passport Service has been proactively planning for the significant increase in demand for many months and has made an unprecedented investment in the staffing and resources necessary to meet this demand.</p><p>The Passport Service aims to register documents onto an application as soon as possible after the documents are delivered. During periods of high demand, the volume of post that the Passport Service receives is significant. The Passport Service operates a sophisticated document management system to manage these volumes. Documents are currently being registered on the day they are received.</p><p>99% of all child and adult online renewal applications are issued within the standard turnaround time and almost half of all adults who renew their passports online will receive their new passport in the post within 2 working days.</p><p>Processing time for first time applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In the space of three months, processing time for first-time applications has been reduced by almost 40%.</p><p>The Passport Service operates an award-winning online service, which compares favourably internationally with countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. There is an ongoing programme of reform in the Passport Service, which continues to look at ways to enhance the customer experience for citizens.</p><p>I am satisfied overall that Passport Service operations are meeting the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements are allowing the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner.</p><p>Passport Service figures show that 4,500 passports have been reported lost or stolen to date in 2022. The Passport Service does not maintain records of the location where passports are lost or stolen. Details of lost or stolen passports are reported to Interpol and these passports are no longer valid for travel. </p></reply>

Headquartered in Dublin, with staff in all regions of the world, it provides rapid and practical support to human rights defenders, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected countries. In 2021, the organisation awarded more than 1,000 protection grants to human rights defenders in 96 countries and provided security support to more than 500 across 55 countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to human rights is at the centre of our foreign policy and the Department has supported Front Line Defenders since its foundation in 2001. They currently receive funding under my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual Programme Grant II, with &euro;592,337 awarded for 2022.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, Minister Coveney inaugurated a memorial monument in Iveagh Gardens alongside UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders, Mary Lawlor, and FLD&rsquo;s Executive Director, Andrew Anderson. It commemorates the lives of human rights defenders who have been killed because of their peaceful work defending the rights of others. The Memorial recognises the important work of human rights defenders globally and pays tribute to the many brave and inspirational individuals who have been silenced.</p>  <p>  In 2021 my officials worked closely with Front Line Defenders to facilitate visas for Afghan human rights defenders at risk, through the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. The Government was commended for its collaboration in securing their safe passage.</p>  <p>  My Department was also pleased to attend the 2022 Front Line Defenders Awards event on 27th May and to host individual meetings with, and be briefed by, the award recipients on their courageous work.</p>  <p>  In October this year, my Department will participate in Front Line Defenders&rsquo; biennial Dublin Platform, hosted at Dublin Castle, joining human rights defenders from across the world to share strategies for advocacy and protection and to build solidarity in our common quest to defend human rights for all. </p></reply>

Food prices are rising as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Responding, my Department through the Irish Aid programme has contributed over &euro;48 million in direct humanitarian support to drought-affected Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia over the past 18 months, working with partners on the ground who can act fast to provide life-saving critical assistance to those who need it most. These interventions complement the Irish Aid investment of over &euro;12 million in development funding last year to communities across the region, including in partnership with Irish NGOs.</p>  <p>In addition, communities in the drought-affected countries are being supported through Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to multilateral humanitarian action, such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which reacts immediately to crises as they happen. Ireland is the 8th largest contributor to CERF providing &euro;11.5 million in 2022. Since 2021, the CERF has allocated almost $100 million to help drought-affected communities in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  We will continue to draw international attention to the crisis in our role on the UN Security Council. As informal focal point on hunger and conflict at the UNSC, Ireland has consistently shone a spotlight on the underlying causes of food insecurity and the links between conflict, hunger and climate change.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has supported a strong EU response to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Horn of Africa. In April, the EU pledged &euro;348 million for 2022 to provide both humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to tackle root causes of food insecurity, including climate adaptation and mitigation measures.</p>  <p>Ireland is a committed global leader on food and nutrition. In 2021 Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to food security and nutrition was reaffirmed with a pledge to spend &euro;800 million over the coming 5 year period for nutrition programmes and interventions.  </p></reply>

Irish officials are closely monitoring this matter, in cooperation with our civil society partners on the ground. Both Ireland and the EU provide financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs who are active in bringing issues regarding the treatment of detainees to light.</p>  <p>  I have called on the Israeli authorities to end the practice of administrative detention completely. Ireland has also repeatedly highlighted the applicability of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law in respect of detainees, in particular obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Detainees must have the right to be informed of the charges underlying any detention, have access to legal assistance, and receive a fair trial.</p>  <p>  At the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland has called on the Israeli authorities, in accordance with their obligations under Article 9 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to refrain from conducting arbitrary arrests and to follow the acceptable procedure established by law regarding arrest and detention. Ireland also made a recommendation to Israel regarding the treatment of detainees during the last Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the Human Rights Council in 2018, expressing concern at Israel&rsquo;s extensive use of administrative detention in particular.</p>  <p>  I have also raised these issues directly with the Israeli authorities during my visits to the region.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been implemented by successive governments, informs our active approach to peace support operations, crisis management, conflict resolution, and peacebuilding. There are no plans to alter this policy at this time.</p>  <p>  At the same time, it is clear that the security situation in Europe has changed fundamentally. Russia&rsquo;s illegal and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, the decisions by Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership, and the upcoming response to the recommendations by the Commission on the Defence Forces have all brought security and defence issues to the fore in our domestic debate.</p>  <p>  In this context, there is undoubtedly a need for a debate on security and defence policy in Ireland, to reflect on the security and defence challenges we face as a country and the best way for us to respond to those challenges. The Taoiseach has indicated that the issues involved could potentially be discussed through a Citizens Assembly or a similar framework. </p>  <p>  It is important that this debate is allowed to take place in an open and evidence-based way, and at an appropriate time. For now, the Government&rsquo;s immediate focus remains on easing the plight of the Ukrainian people and holding the Russian leadership to account.</p></reply>

The EU also spoke at that session, calling on the Myanmar de facto authorities to apply the moratorium on executions observed since 1988. In particular, the EU called on the de facto Myanmar authorities not to carry out the death sentences announced last week, to which the Deputy is referring. At a private meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 27 May, Ireland reiterated our grave concern at the deteriorating security, human rights and humanitarian situation in Myanmar, particularly violence against civilians and the ongoing brutality of the Tatmadaw. </p>  <p>  As I have outlined in my previous statements on this matter, the election results of November 2020 and the sustained, large-scale popular opposition to the coup since 1 February demonstrate that the military have no mandate to govern Myanmar. The people of Myanmar have been resolute in rejecting the military coup. General Min Aung Hlaing&rsquo;s self-appointment as Prime Minister is a clear attempt to normalise his position and does not reflect the democratic will of the people of Myanmar. Ireland has had no engagement or bilateral meeting with the Myanmar military. </p>  <p>We will continue to work with our partners in the EU, in the region, and in the context of our United Nations Security Council membership to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis, to consider further actions to restore the democratic path in Myanmar, and to protect the people of Myanmar.  </p></reply>

Our longstanding cooperation and lesson-sharing around peacebuilding has been very successful and is a key pillar of our relationship. </p>  <p>  As part of that relationship, Ireland takes a very active role in supporting human rights defenders, indigenous communities and civil society space in Colombia. We recognise that addressing social, land-related and environmental issues is an essential component of Colombia&rsquo;s peace process, and we remain firmly committed to supporting the comprehensive implementation of the 2016 Peace Agreement.</p>  <p>  I am aware of human rights concerns that have been raised by civil society around the operation of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine and my Department has been following these issues closely.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Bogota has visited the region where the mine is located, as well as the mine itself, on two occasions. On both occasions, the Embassy interacted with all parties to the issues, including various local communities, local authorities, and the management of the mine, in order to gain a greater understanding of the circumstances. We have maintained this engagement with all stakeholders, including through the EU Delegation in Colombia.</p>  <p>  Our assessment has been that the situation on the ground is complex. The Embassy, along with our EU partners, continues to encourage all stakeholders to engage in inclusive dialogue in order to resolve the issues.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy refers to in his question, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has indicated to the Department of Foreign Affairs that the ESB recently ordered coal from the Cerrejon mine in order to maintain a secure coal supply.</p>  <p>  The ESB has indicated that they work with other purchasers collectively through the Bettercoal initiative, and has highlighted that the Cerrejon mine is subject to independent assessments and that these are conducted in line with the Bettercoal Code, which establishes principles and standards to manage and mitigate the environmental, social and governance risks in coal supply chains.</p>  <p>  In the area of business and human rights, my Department works closely with the multi-stakeholder Implementation Group for the National Plan on Business and Human Rights. This Group regularly engages with experts and considers best practice. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that officials in my Department in Dublin and at our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; will continue to remain actively engaged on all of the above issues and to maintain close contact with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the ESB on this matter.</p></reply>

It&rsquo;s also fair to employees and ensures that they receive an appropriate and predictable level of compensation if they are unable to work due to illness or injury.</p>  <p>  The scheme has been designed based on consultation with employee and employer representatives. Prior to seeking Cabinet approval for the draft of the Bill, my officials undertook a full public consultation that sought the views of relevant stakeholders and the public on key policy questions around the design of the scheme. </p>  <p>  As a starting point, this scheme will cover the three &lsquo;waiting days&rsquo; before eligibility for illness benefit from the State. However, the length of coverage will increase over time, eventually providing for an entitlement to 10 working days or two weeks per year in the fourth year of the scheme&rsquo;s operation and this will see costs rise for employers. </p>  <p>  With regards to the rebate proposal any changes will follow the scheme&rsquo;s commencement, and will be considered in light of businesses' experience of the early operation of the scheme.</p></reply>

Draft policy papers have been circulated for the information of the group.</p>  <p>  These initial draft policy papers will inform the single comprehensive draft policy statement on which work is ongoing.  In addition, the National Inland Fisheries Forum (NIFF) has recently been re-established and comprises a significantly broader range of national stakeholder interests. Its first meeting took place in late May. The preliminary component draft policy papers may also be provided to NIFF for its information.</p>  <p>  Once all of the preliminary draft policy papers have been completed, they will inform a single comprehensive policy statement for the whole sector. As previously advised this policy statement will be the subject of broad public consultation towards the end of this year.</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. Under State aid rules, my Department is not permitted to displace commercial investment by intervening in areas where commercial investment exists or is planned, as to do so would be an infringement of the State aid rules. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the area in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to ensure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision. In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations.  As such, I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services. </p>  <p>  The 20% fare reduction comes on top of several other measures that we are progressing to encourage greater public transport patronage. For instance, the Young Adult Card, which provides an average 50% fare discount for those aged between 19 and 23 on both PSO and commercial services. As well as the TFI 90 Minute Fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin. In May alone, the number of people who had a Child Leap Card, Student Leap Card, or the new Young Adult Leap Card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging.</p>  <p>  While fare reductions are to be welcomed, investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, I am committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+ as well as improving existing services across the country.</p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the cost of public transport, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication.  </p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI). This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home.  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as neighbourhood or residential charging, destination charging, and en-route or motorway charging.</p>  <p>  A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in: </p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles </p>  <p>  - Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date. </p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations and delivery of new, faster and higher capacity technology is awaited to complete this element of the program, due in August and the upgrade program will resume then.  The remaining locations have all been identified and surveyed. </p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced. </p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project including the rollout of charge points in each county can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.  </p>  <p>  The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Charging Infrastructure Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department is developing new grant schemes which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations including hotels, car parks and visitor and tourist attractions, both State-owned and commercial sites. This new initiative will  be open for applications from both the public and private sector and help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging. </p>  <p>  As well as the ESB ecars network there are a number of private charge point operators with sites already live in Ireland. Once established, ZEVI will be tasked with developing a single interactive portal for mapping the location and availability of all publicly accessible EV charging points and provide offer a central source of information to EV owners.</p></reply>

It is the chargeable gain that is taxed, not the whole amount you receive. The gain is usually the difference between the price you paid for the asset and the price you disposed of it for or the market value at the time of disposal.</p>  <p>  There are a number of investment products which are subject to exit tax including life assurance policies, collective investment funds and ETFs. The normal tax treatment afforded to these products is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund. This is known as the &lsquo;gross roll-up&rsquo; regime. The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice. </p>  <p>  The general thrust of the regime is that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising to a fund. However, a fund has responsibility to deduct exit tax in respect of payments made to certain unit holders in that fund when a &lsquo;chargeable event&rsquo; occurs. </p>  <p>  Finance Act 2006 introduced the concept of a deemed disposal as a new chargeable event. A disposal is deemed to occur 8 years following acquisition of a fund and then every 8 years thereafter. Any gain on the investment which arises from the date of acquisition to the date of the deemed disposal is subject to tax. This ensures that income cannot be rolled up indefinitely in the fund without being taxed. On the ultimate disposal of the investment any tax paid which arose as a result of a deemed disposal is allowed as a credit against any final tax liability on disposal.</p>  <p>  Comparison of the rate of CGT and exit tax on a headline rate basis does not account for the fact that individual disposals within a fund are rolled up which allows the gross income earned or gains made to be reinvested by the fund until the occurrence of a chargeable event. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as with all taxes, both CGT and exit tax are subject to ongoing review which includes the consideration and assessment of the rate along with any associated reliefs and exemptions. Tax policy and legislation are reviewed by the Tax Strategy Group as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant such as a grandchild of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases.  The respective thresholds apply to all gifts and inheritances received within the same Group - they are never doubled.  Therefore, a child will not be entitled to a Group threshold of &euro;670,000 in any circumstance.</p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of his or her relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, where a person receives a gift or inheritance from a parent, the Group A threshold of &euro;335,000 applies.  In the circumstances described by the Deputy, the receipt by each child of benefits from his or her surviving parent will be aggregated with any benefits received from the parent who has died for the purposes of determining whether the threshold of &euro;335,000 has been exceeded. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, a person may receive gifts up to a total value of &euro;3,000 from any person in any calendar year without having to pay CAT (the &ldquo;small gifts exemption&rdquo;).  Gifts within this limit are not taken into account in computing tax and are not included for aggregation purposes.  For the purposes of determining whether the small gifts exemption is due, the relationship between disponer and beneficiary are not relevant, and the exemption is not transferable.  In the circumstances described by the Deputy, each child would be entitled to receive gifts up to the value of &euro;3,000 from the surviving parent in any calendar year.  Prior to the death of their other parent, each child would have been entitled to receive gifts up to the total value of &euro;3,000 from each parent free of tax, potentially having a combined total value of &euro;6,000 each year. </p></reply>

This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Go Ahead, Luas, DART and Local Link services. </p><p>- a reduction of the Drug Payment Scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;80 benefitting just over 70,000 families</p><p>- the working family payment budget increase was brought forward from 1 June to 1 April</p><p>- reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children. </p><p>This package of measures built on measures already introduced in Budget 2022, provides support to all domestic electricity users via the energy credit and also provides targeted support to vulnerable households via the welfare system.  Low income households have received an overall increase of 55% in Fuel Allowance support provided during the most recent Fuel Allowance season as compared to the previous season taking the &euro;5 increase in the weekly payment introduced as part of the Budget last October, the &euro;125 lump sum payment provided earlier this year together and the &euro;100 extra May payment.</p><p>The Government announced a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil. This measure, to the value of &euro;320 million, was introduced with effect from 10 March reducing the VAT inclusive excise duty on petrol, diesel and MGO by 20, 15 and 2 cent per litre respectively. These reductions mitigate the cost of a fill of a 60 litre tank by some &euro;12 for petrol and &euro;9 for diesel. This assists all transport users, rural and urban, including commuters, business and farmers. These measures have been extended to 11 October 2022, with an additional 3 cent reduction for MGO. The extended measures will cost a further &euro;97m. </p><p>In addition to these measures, the Government took the decision to reduce the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity from 13.5% to 9% until October 31, 2022, costing an estimated &euro;46m and resulting in estimated annual savings of &euro;49 on gas and &euro;69 on electricity bills for households.  In relation to VAT on home heating oil, the position is that a reduced rate of 13.5% VAT currently applies to it. This rate is applied on the basis of a historical derogation from the standard VAT rate that should apply. The rate applied to domestic energy supplies such as oil and solid fuels is 13.5%. As this is a &lsquo;parked&rsquo; rate it cannot be reduced below 12%. </p><p>The Government is of course very much aware of concerns regarding the ongoing impacts of increased energy prices and Government Departments will continue to monitor energy markets and consumer prices to ensure evidence based policy guidance in advance of Budget 2023.</p><p>In conclusion, I propose to keep the taxation of fuel including home heating oil under review as part of preparations for Budget 2023.</p></reply>

These trends are driven primarily by global factors. The key drivers of this increase are increases in wholesale energy prices as a result of the rapid rebound in global demand, global supply chain disruptions and the imbalance between demand and supply that emerged as economies re-opened.  More recently, as a result of the war in Ukraine, oil and gas prices have risen further.  It is not possible for the Government to fully insulate consumers against these price impacts, however, a number of very significant steps have been taken to lessen the impact of increased fuel prices.  </p><p>On fuel excise, a package of measures, to the value of &euro;320 million, was introduced with effect from 10 March reducing the VAT inclusive excise duty on petrol, diesel and MGO by 20, 15 and 2 cent per litre respectively. These reductions mitigate the cost of a fill of a 60 litre tank by some &euro;12 for petrol and &euro;9 for diesel. This assists all transport users, rural and urban, including commuters, business and farmers. These measures have been extended to 11 October 2022, with an additional 3 cent reduction for MGO. The extended measures will cost a further &euro;97m.</p><p>It should be noted that the above changes were made within the constraints  of the Energy Tax Directive (ETD).  The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels.</p><p>In addition to the above rate changes, I also brought forward legislation in Finance Act 2021 to provide for a temporary reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT to MOT on petrol and diesel . This reduction came into effect on 1 April. I took this step to partially offset the expected rise in fuel costs arising from an increase in the Biofuel Obligation for transport fuels proposed by my colleague the Minister for Transport. Both rate cuts will remain in place until 11 October this year.  </p><p>MOT rates on petrol since Budget night last year are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons with the ETD minimum rate.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Petrol rates/1,000L from</th>       <th>MOT non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT carbon </th>       <th>Total MOT</th>       <th>ETD minimum</th>       <th>MOT &amp;gt; ETD minimum by</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>13 October 2021</td>       <td>&euro;541.84</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;636.71</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;277.71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10 March 2022</td>       <td>&euro;379.24</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;474.11</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;115.11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 April 2022</td>       <td>&euro;371.11</td>       <td>&euro;94.87</td>       <td>&euro;465.98</td>       <td>&euro;359.00</td>       <td>&euro;106.98</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>MOT rates on auto-diesel are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons with the ETD minimum rate.

The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of MOT is available when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 per litre excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre/&euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. At current retail prices the repayment rate is at this maximum.</p><p>It is important to note that the effective MOT rate on auto-diesel must be considered in ensuring compliance with the ETD. The effective rate includes the maximum MOT rate repayable under the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS), currently &euro;75.00 per 1,000 litres. The current MOT rate on auto-diesel is &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres, which is &euro;75.38 above the ETD minimum. However, when the DRS is taken into account, the effective MOT rate is &euro;0.38 per 1,000 litres, or 0.038 cents per litre, above the ETD minimum, meaning that any material reduction in the effective MOT rate would be incompatible with EU law.</p><p>Any reduction in the VAT on fuel/petrol would require the standard rate of VAT (23%) to be reduced. The estimated cost of a 1% reduction is &euro;542m annually. </p><p>In conclusion, I propose to keep the taxation of fuel under review as part of preparations for Budget 2023.</p></reply>

While the Park is accessible at all times, due to a public right of way, the OPW close all other gates. There is no public lighting in the Park which limits the time it can be safely accessed by the public. The closure of the gate at night helps to discourage anti-social behaviour when there are no OPW staff on site. This maintains and preserves the solemn, serene atmosphere of this elegant garden so that visitors can relax and reflect, on what this Memorial Garden represents. It should be noted that the closing times of these gardens are similar to those in other city parks. </p>  <p>  The timing of the closure of the gate is operational as the staff involved have responsibilities at other sites.

This was a temporary measure in response to the unprecedented circumstances presented by the COVID pandemic.  Special Leave with Pay has been used in lieu of sick leave across the Public Service to assist in the prevention of the possible onward spread of COVID-19 in the work premises.</p><p>From the outset of the pandemic my officials have been clear, via the &ldquo;Guidance and FAQs for Public Service Employers during COVID-19&rdquo; document, that Special Leave with Pay is a temporary measure which is kept under regular review.  Changes have been made to the arrangements over the course of the last two years in line with changes to public health, Government guidance and the general return to the workplace.</p><p>It is important to note that Special Leave with Pay is not ending. From 1 July 2022, Special Leave with Pay for COVID-19 will continue to be available for the stated self-isolation period, which is currently 7 days. This is in keeping with the rationale of assisting in the prevention of the possible onward spread of COVID-19 in the work premises.</p><p>I would also point out that the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations were introduced in 2014. It was a significant reform development that standardised and simplified paid sick leave arrangements across all sectors of the Public Service.

I have no role in the scheduling of fixtures or selection of venues and it would be inappropriate for me to intervene in such operational decisions of sporting organisations. Accordingly, I have not had discussions in this regard. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I acknowledge that the current cost of living pressures could potentially impact on attendance at sporting events and I would encourage sporting organisations to be mindful of this as well as of climate impacts when scheduling venues for matches and events. </p>  <p>  Significant funding support was provided to sporting organisations in 2020 and 2021 to assist them in meeting the challenges of Covid. This funding was particularly important for those National Governing Bodies that depend on revenue from gate receipts and spectator attendance. Since the restrictions on spectator attendance were lifted, spectators have returned to sporting events in great numbers and I hope that this will continue to be the case for upcoming events. My officials and I will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  With regard to climate action and major sports events, my Department is currently developing a new Major Sports Events Policy, which was recently the subject of a public consultation process.  The policy is still in development and it is envisaged that improving the sustainability of major sports events and exploring the use of high profile events as platforms to promote sustainability will form part of that policy development process. This, along with other specific actions under the Climate Action Plan, will ensure that sustainable practices are adopted across the sport sector. </p></reply>

The overall aim of the Directive is to maintain high and good status waters where they exist and to restore waters that do not currently reach these standards.  River basin management planning, structured in six-year cycles, is the tool prescribed by the Directive for achieving these aims.</p>  <p>  Building on the successful elements of the first River Basin Management Plans cycle, the Government introduced new structures for implementation of the Directive as part of the second-cycle river basin management plan that covers the period 2018-2021. These new structures include the Water Policy Advisory Committee (WPAC), which provides high-level policy direction and oversight of implementation. The National Coordination and Management Committee, formed under WPAC, ensures that the measures necessary to achieve our objectives are implemented in an efficient, effective and co-ordinated way. The National Technical Implementation Group, co-ordinates ongoing tracking of implementation and provides a forum for knowledge sharing. Finally, the regional local authority structures, comprising of 5 regional committees, drive delivery of supporting measures at local level.</p>  <p>  These structures are further supported by the Local Authority Waters Programme (LAWPRO). Funded by my Department, LAWPRO is responsible for;</p>  <p>  - Coordinating efforts by local authorities, public bodies and other stakeholders to achieve the water quality objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive</p>  <p>  - Supporting local communities to get involved in caring for their local waters and participate in decision making and river basin management plans, and</p>  <p>  - Applying catchment science to identify the issues impacting on water quality in a number of Priority Areas for Action and to refer them to the relevant bodies for action.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation of the Directive in Ireland, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with, inter alia, the monitoring of water status in order to establish a comprehensive overview of water status within each river basin district.  A full assessment of the overall quality and ecological status of Ireland&rsquo;s waters takes place every three years, with the most recent full report published in 2019. In the intervening years, the EPA publishes a report on the indicators of water quality. </p>  <p>  The latest indicators report for 2020 highlights that the main risk to water quality continues to be excess nutrients in our rivers, lakes and coastal areas, with the trends in some areas going in the wrong direction.  The oversupply of nutrients is coming from agricultural land and from underperforming urban and domestic waste water systems.</p>  <p>  However, I welcome the positive signs that some rivers are showing evidence of improvement, particularly in the Priority Areas for Action that were identified for targeted action in the current River Basin Management Plan for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Our water resources are facing complex pressures, and increasing demands, from population change; expected further growth in the economy; as well as from a changing climate.  As a result, we will need a cross-sector collective effort to protect Ireland&rsquo;s water quality.</p>  <p>  On agricultural nutrients, I am working closely with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on effective measures to address these issues through the River Basin Management Plan process, the Nitrates Action Programme and the CAP Strategic Plan.</p>  <p>  Our farmers, food producers and our agricultural system must work in harmony with our environment if we are to maintain our clean, green image.  We must carefully manage how we use nutrients on our agricultural land to both secure productivity gains and reduce the loss of excess nutrients to water.</p>  <p>  To do this we must continue to work together at a local catchment-scale using programmes such as LAWPRO and the Agriculture Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme (ASSAP) who work directly with communities and with farmers to protect and deliver improvements in water quality. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme is another key instrument in achieving good water quality. It is designed to prevent pollution of surface waters and groundwater from agricultural sources and to protect and improve water quality. Following the fourth review of Ireland&rsquo;s Nitrates Action Programme, the 5th Nitrates Action Programme was finalised and the Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters Regulations (SI 113 of 2022)  were signed in March. The new Action Programme came into effect on the 11th March and will run until the end of 2025, with an interim review taking place in 2023. </p>  <p>  To address waste water issues, Irish Water must continue to deliver its capital investment programme.  While progress is being made by Irish Water in reducing the number of waste water plants on the EPA&rsquo;s priority action list, continued and sustained investment is needed to reduce the impact from insufficiently treated waste water discharges and to meet our Water Framework Directive objectives. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the National Development Plan 2021-2030 commits to almost &euro;6 billion in capital  investment by Irish Water in the period from 2021-2025, of which over &euro;4.5 billion will be Voted Exchequer funded in respect of domestic water services. As part of Budget 2022, I secured funding of over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.459 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. </p>  <p>  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine areas.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is also currently preparing the third River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, to cover the period 2022 &ndash; 2027. A key commitment in the Programme for Government, a revised and strengthened River Basin Management Plan will be published later this year.</p>  <p>  Building on the work of the second-cycle, this plan will again describe the main pressures and activities affecting water status and set out the environmental objectives to be achieved up to 2027 and identify the measures needed to achieve these objectives, including those highlighted by the EPA. </p></reply>

The Plans are being revised and updated by local authorities in the light of ongoing engagement and clarifications, and I expect that they will be ready for publication shortly. They will provide a comprehensive overview of projected delivery of affordable housing in Kildare, and nationally.</p>  <p>  Funding is made available by Government to assist local authority and AHB delivery of affordable housing, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund, previously known as the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), and the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL). SSF funding will support the delivery of 10 affordable purchase homes of a mixed tenure housing development at Ardclough Road in Celbridge, Co. Kildare. Kildare County Council has advised my Department, construction is expected to begin on site by the end of 2023, with projected delivery of these affordable homes by the 1st Quarter of 2025. </p>  <p>  40 CREL-supported Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip, Co. Kildare in December 2021, where cost rents charged are approximately 40% below comparable market rents in the area. A further 16 Cost Rental homes will be tenanted in this development by the end of this month.</p>  <p>  The most recent Cost Rental vacancies in Kildare have just been advertised by the Cl&uacute;id AHB and are located at The Paddocks in Newbridge. The first phase of the development includes 46 one, two and three bedroom apartments, with cost-covering rents for these apartments at &euro;1,000 per month for the one bedroom units, &euro;1,240 for the two bedroom units and &euro;1,350 for the three bedroom units, which represent significant discounts of approximately 25-30% on market rents in the area. These Cost Rental homes will also be tenanted by the end of this month.</p>  <p>Under the 2nd   Call for Proposals for CREL funding, issued to AHBs in October 2021, I gave approval in principle to the allocation of &euro;53.6 million for the provision of 521 Cost Rental homes across 11 sites in 7 local authority areas, including Kildare. Three of these 11 sites, comprising a total of 186 Cost Rental homes, are currently scheduled to be delivered in Kildare in 2022. The necessary financial and commercial arrangements in relation to the other projects approved under the second call for proposals under CREL are being completed by the AHBs concerned.  When these arrangements are concluded, details of the projects, including specific locations, housing typologies and cost-covering rents, will be made public.</p>  <p>  In addition, the LDA has submitted a revised planning permission for 219 social and affordable units at Devoy Barracks in Naas, Co. Kildare. The LDA will comply with Part V regulations and the remaining homes are intended to be a blended mix of Cost Rental and affordable purchase.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders and I can confirm that all parties are working with a view to deploying the scheme next month.  It will improve access to newly-built homes, below the median price point, by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. This measure, targeted at First Time or fresh start buyers, will allow purchasers to exit the rental market, help to build developer confidence in realisable consumer demand, and contribute to the recovery of our construction sector following the Covid-19 emergency. It will be available nationwide.</p>  <p>  Other measures to allow buyers to affordably access newly-constructed housing such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan (formerly the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan), are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable. Information on these schemes is available at the following links:</p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx, and</p>  <p>  localauthorityhomeloan.ie/</p></reply>

It will see 54,000 affordable home interventions which includes 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost rental homes to be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Land Development Agency (LDA) and through &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks. </p>  <p>  Under pathway 1 of this strategy, &ldquo;Pathways to Home Ownership and Increasing Affordability&rdquo;, two new Affordable Purchase schemes are being established (the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme and the First Home shared equity scheme), as well as a new Cost Rental tenancy and an improved Local Authority Home Loan scheme. All of these affordable schemes are available to single applicants. </p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme assists first-time purchasing Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. </p>  <p>  I recently signed the Affordable Housing Regulations 2022 and the Affordable Housing (No. 2) Regulations 2022, which set out a number of matters, including eligibility criteria and sale prices, for the Local Authority Affordable Purchase scheme. </p>  <p>  Under the Regulations and section 11 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, scope has been provided to allow a Local Authority implement a Scheme of Priority in respect of 30% of dwellings which would, for example, give priority for one-bedroom homes to single persons. This is at the initiative of the Local Authority concerned, though under the legislation the draft Schemes must be submitted to the Minister for consideration. </p>  <p>   For households and individuals more suited to renting a home, the Housing for All strategy also includes measures to improve security and affordability in the rental market, including the introduction of Cost Rental tenancies. The rent levels of Cost Rental tenancies are based on the cost of the provision of homes, rather than being subject to the pressures of the open market. </p>  <p>  My Department has directed Cost Rental landlords to seek the efficient use of resources by allocating appropriately sized homes according to household needs. This direction is to ensure that landlords place tenants into homes of an appropriate size, in order to maximise the efficient use of the limited number of properties that have been available during the initial rollout of Cost Rental. Over the period of the Housing for All plan from 2021 to 2030, it is intended that 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered in our urban centres by Local Authorities, AHBs and the LDA. These Cost Rental homes will accommodate a range of different household types and sizes, including individuals living alone or in smaller households, as further developments are completed. </p>  <p>  To date, approval in principle has been confirmed so far for 911 Cost Rental homes to be delivered by AHBs under the CREL scheme in the period to 2023. These will range in sizes from those suitable to smaller households to larger family homes and will include 110 one-bedroom residences. Up to 234 Cost Rental homes are expected to have been completed across the country by the end of this month, and within 12 months of the passing of the Affordable Housing Act to regulate this entirely new sector last July. </p>  <p>   In addition to the schemes already mentioned, Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides for the establishment of the &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; affordable purchase shared equity scheme to support purchases of new homes in the private market. The Scheme aims to support c. 8,000 households in the private market in the years out to 2026.  </p>  <p>  First Home will help applicants to afford new homes in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. The Scheme will primarily support households including single first-time buyers in the purchase of new homes within designated regional price ceilings, set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by first-time buyers in the area. </p>  <p>  Subject to the necessary final approvals process of all founders to the scheme, which will see the State operate the scheme in a strategic partnership with participating mortgage lenders, it is anticipated that First Home will become operational in the coming weeks. Full information, including full eligibility criteria and regional price ceilings for homes, will be available on the First Home website upon the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.  </p>  <p>  Other measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable. </p>  <p>  Housing for All introduced the Local Authority Home Loan scheme as a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The new Local Authority Home Loan commenced on 4 January 2022 and is available for families and single people on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. The loan can be used by first-time buyers and Fresh Start applicants for both for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds. </p>  <p>  Under the Local Authority Home Loan scheme the income ceiling for a single applicant has been increased from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000 in counties where the scheme's house price limit is &euro;320,000 (Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow). In the rest of the country, where the scheme&rsquo;s house price limit is &euro;250,000, the income ceiling for a single applicant is &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  More details on the Local Authority Home Loan scheme are available on the following link: </p>  <p>  localauthorityhomeloan.ie/. </p>  <p>The Help-to-Buy incentive supports First-time Buyers in meeting the deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to First-Time Buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home.   </p></reply>

Examples of the type of works would include the extension of a dwelling in the case of overcrowding or the provision of a downstairs bedroom ensuite or bathroom in the case of elderly or disabled persons.</p>  <p>  My Department's approach every year is to issue a single full year allocation to each local authority, so they can plan, prioritise and implement the programme. Exchequer funding of &euro;23.6 million is being made available under the 2022 programme of which almost &euro;700,000 has been allocated to Mayo County Council. The allocation for Mayo County Council is equal to their request for funding per their 2022 work programme submitted to the Department earlier this year.</p>  <p>Under the delegated sanction currently in place, the maximum cost of works in each individual case is &euro;75,000 and my Department will fund 90% of the cost of eligible works.  Therefore, the maximum Departmental funding available per project under delegated sanction is &euro;67,500. In such cases a contribution of 10% of the cost will be required from the Authority&rsquo;s own resources.</p>  <p>  Where the total cost of works to a property is projected to exceed &euro;75,000 and additional funding is sought by the local authority, prior approval from the Department is required. The maximum Department contribution will remain at 90% of the cost of eligible works.</p>  <p>  Over the course of the year, my Department works closely with the local authorities to monitor spend and to achieve a full drawdown of the available funding. This means that if underspends arise on the part of some local authorities, they can be redistributed to other authorities. Furthermore, if a local authority is dealing with a high level of applications or in the case of unforeseen emergency works, further additional funding can be requested from my Department and every effort will be made to accede to any such request.</p></reply>

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022 for people on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. It is available for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The Local Authority Home Loan can also be used for the purchase of homes through State schemes such as the Tenant Purchase Scheme and Affordable Housing Schemes, with the exception of the First Home Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Local Authority Home Loan assists borrowers in securing an affordable, long-term fixed rate mortgage to purchase a home of their own. The Scheme supports home ownership amongst lower to moderate income households by reducing the cost of mortgage finance and increasing the level of financing available, particularly for single applicants in urban areas. For clarity, the Local Authority Home Loan supports private home ownership and is separate from the qualification for social housing.</p>  <p>  Under the Local Authority Home Loan scheme the income ceiling for a single applicant in counties where the scheme's house price limit is &euro;320,000 (Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow) has been increased from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000. In the rest of the country, where the scheme&rsquo;s house price limit is &euro;250,000, the income ceiling for a single applicant will remain at &euro;50,000. The income ceiling for joint applicants remains at &euro;75,000.</p>  <p>  Further details can be found on the following websites localauthorityhomeloan.ie/ and www.gov.ie/en/service/00500-local-authority-home-loan-scheme/</p></reply>

This data provides details on local authority, approved housing body and Part V delivery and is available to the end of 2021. This is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/  </p><p>Further details on Part V delivery by each local authority are also published on my Department's website. This provides details on Part V delivery by each local authority and approved housing body delivery in each local authority area. This is available at: www.gov.ie/en/collection/fd048-affordable-housing-and-part-v-statistics/ </p><p>Data for Q1 2022 is currently being collated by my Department and will be published shortly. </p><p>My Department also publishes the Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR). The CSR provides details of social housing developments that have been completed, are under construction or are progressing through the various stages of the design and pre-tender process. The most recent publication was for Q4 2021. The report is available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/af746-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q4-2021/  </p><p>A version of CSR file can be downloaded at the following link and used for analysis in terms of local authority, funding programme, project status, location, approved housing body  and completion date: data.gov.ie/dataset/social-housing-construction-status-report-q4-2021?package_type=dataset </p><p>Social housing construction is funded through a range of different delivery streams such as local authority direct construction, Part V, turnkey developments and regeneration programmes and through direct construction and turnkey developments delivered by approved housing bodies. </p><p>The funding provided by my Department to each local authority in respect of social housing build programmes in each of the past five years is set out in the table.  </p><p>In relation to 2022, up to end

Department. Therefore, the amount of funding granted by housing authorities to individual homeless services is a matter for the relevant housing authority.

Immigration matters are raised in our high-level political engagements with the US at every opportunity, not least during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s bilateral engagement with President Biden for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. I also raised immigration issues during my most recent visit to Washington, D.C. and Boston in late April. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to see that immigration, including identifying possible pathways to citizenship for the undocumented, is a priority for President Biden, as demonstrated by his proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. The Irish Government is actively supporting the efforts being made by his Administration, as well as efforts being made by the US Congress, in the pursuit of comprehensive immigration reform, which still remains a very divisive issue politically in the US.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington D.C. and network of Consulates across the US continue to raise immigration issues, seek new immigration pathways, and support US immigration reform through active engagement at all levels with the US Administration and political leaders.</p>  <p>  A key element of this engagement includes finding long-term solutions to address the challenges faced by the undocumented Irish in the US. An example of this is a bill passed by the Massachusetts State Senate in May that will enable undocumented immigrants to acquire a Massachusetts Driving License. Our Consulate in Boston has supported this initiative which will improve the lives of undocumented Irish citizens, in a small but practical way, living in that state. </p>  <p>  The Government also remains committed to providing support and annual funding to organisations, including the US Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers.

Over 623,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022. This is 105,000 more passports than were issued at this point of the year in 2019.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is continually working to deliver enhanced customer experience and service delivery to our citizens. This year the Passport Service is experiencing an unprecedented volume of demand for passports. This is as a direct result of pent-up demand for travel after two years of pandemic-related restrictions. </p>  <p>  This level of demand is not unique to Ireland. In countries such as the UK and United States, the turnaround time for all types of passports can be up to 10 weeks. The Passport Service has managed to decrease the processing times for first time online applications by 40% since March. Processing time for first time applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In addition, almost half of adult online renewals are processed within 2 days. Our Passport Service is performing at its highest capacity ever and is producing an average of 6,000 passports per day. The current processing times are:</p>  <p>  - Online adult renewal - 10 working days</p>  <p>  - Online child/complex renewal - 15 working days</p>  <p>  - Online first time application - 25 working days (from 6 June)</p>  <p>  - An Post Passport Service - 8 weeks</p>  <p>  In order to achieve these type of results and to continue to improve the service, my Department has made a huge investment in the Passport Service. In terms of staffing, over 400 staff have been assigned to the Passport Service since June of last year, including 120 in recent weeks. The addition of these staff has allowed the Passport Service to maintain its current turnaround times in the face of enormous levels of demand.</p>  <p>  In addition to significantly more staff being assigned, the Passport Service has made important improvements that will help to ensure that passport applications can be processed without delay:</p>  <p>1.   A large number of the new staff are being assigned to the Customer Service Hub. This will greatly increase the number of calls and webchats being answered and will assist with customers getting access to the information they need.</p>  <p>  2. In addition to this, the Passport Service released two online video guides that provide tips to ensure that passport photos and witnessed consent forms for children are correctly submitted. Passport photos and witnessed consent forms are some of the main reasons that an application may be rejected, so it is important the customers have all the information they need to ensure that these are submitted correctly. These easy-to-follow video guides are available on my Department's website and social media channels and I encourage all applicants to watch them before they submit their application.</p>  <p>  3. My Department is currently running a national radio and print public information campaign reminding our citizens to check their passports and to apply online. This campaign also offers tips for ensuring your application is correct and complete. This is running in 10 national newspapers and on national and local radio in Ireland, as well as in Northern Ireland. In addition to this, national radio interviews have been undertaken by Passport Service management. These interviews have helped to inform the public of the length of time it takes to apply for a passport and to promote Passport Online which is the quickest and easiest way to apply for a passport. </p>  <p>  4. Over the past number of weeks the Passport Service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified. This new system assists in reducing the number of applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details.</p>  <p>  5. Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service uses modeling software to monitor and predict levels of demand based on demand in previous years and taking into account renewal dates of passports already in circulation, as well as consumer demand for travel. We are currently seeing high volumes of applications due to pent-up demand following pandemic-related travel restrictions. Turnaround times are based on predicted levels of demand as well as resources available. The Passport Service uses workforce planning software to assign staff resources to the areas of highest demand. This is continuously monitored by Passport Service management.</p>  <p>  There are a number of steps that passport applications must go through before being dispatched to the applicant:</p>  <p>  1. Registration of the passport application either online or through An Post Passport.</p>  <p>  2. Submission of the required supporting documents to the Passport Service (if applicable).</p>  <p>  3. Passport Service registers the documents and verifies their validity.</p>  <p>  4. The application is processed by an entitlement checker who confirms the applicant's identity and that they are entitled to Irish citizenship. In cases of children, the checker verifies the consent of the child's guardians with the witness.</p>  <p>  5. Application is approved or the applicant is contacted if additional supporting documents are required.</p>  <p>  6. Once approved, the passport is printed and dispatched to the applicant.</p>  <p>  All passport staff involved in checking and approving passports have their work spot-checked and audited.</p>  <p>  Many parts of the process are fully automated and there are a number of systems in place to ensure the integrity and security of the process. The Irish passport is rated 5th in the world in terms of security and offers our citizens visa-free access to 187 countries. </p>  <p>  If an applicant requires a resubmission link for a new consent form, the process can take up to 5 days due to the volume of resubmission links that are being requested. Resubmission links are valid for 5 days. Additional staffing recently assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce the number of days it takes for this process. </p>  <p>  With regard to checking of applications as soon as they are received, this is simply a question of the volume of applications currently being submitted. When applications are received, they enter a queue and are checked in order of the date they are received. If they are fully correct and complete they will be printed and dispatched to the customer as soon as they are checked. If there is an issue with the application, the Passport Service will alert the customer and any additional documents are processed in three weeks or less once received back from the customer. </p>  <p>  The Urgent Appointment service continues to operate successfully in both Cork and Dublin. Additional staff have been added to the public-facing areas to deal with high demand for this service during the summer months. Appointments are currently scheduled to be 20 minutes long and can only be processed using a paper application which does not have in built efficiencies of the online system. Currently only one applicant can be processed in one appointment. The Passport Service will continue to examine ways to improve this service for customers. </p>  <p>  Passport Online is continuing to expand and is now available to 97% of our citizens around the world. Most recently, Passport Online has been rolled out to first time applicants in the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Kuwait and Qatar. The availability of Passport Online worldwide will continue to enhance customer experience and will mean even more efficiencies for the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  I encourage all citizens to check their passports before booking any travel and to apply online and on time.</p></reply>

While the Passport Service records the reason why a passport application may be cancelled this is not done in a way that can be tracked for reporting purposes.Passport Service figures show that 20% of applications currently in the system have no supporting documents attached. The onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Passport Service to enable processing to begin. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that some applicants can take longer than the allowed time to send in the necessary documents. Applications which are in the system for longer than six months automatically expire. The majority of applications cancelled in 2021 are applications where insufficient documents were submitted within six months of the application being made. </p><p>The Passport Service has a formal comments and complaints procedure in place to allow customers an opportunity to give feedback on the quality of the service they receive. </p><p>The Passport Service is committed to providing a high quality, effective service to all of our customers and welcomes feedback on how the service can be improved. All feedback is dealt with in confidence and in an impartial manner.</p><p>Customers can submit a complaint in writing to: Passport Complaints, Knockmaun House, 42-47, Lower Mount Street, Dublin 2, D02 TN83. A postal submission system is deemed the most accessible procedure for all as it facilitates those who do not wish to or are unable to use online facilities. This is currently the only channel through which complaints can be submitted. </p><p>The Passport Service aims to resolve complaints as promptly as possible. Each complaint is examined upon receipt and acknowledged. The complaint will then be investigated and a response issued in writing.</p><p>If customers remain unhappy with the response, they can refer their complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p><p>Further details of the Passport Service complaints procedure can be found on the DFA website - www.dfa.ie/about-us/our-commitments/passport-complaints-and-appeals/.</p><p>The Passport Service Customer Service Hub is available to respond to customer queries by phone and webchat. The Customer Service Hub handled over 100,000 queries to date this year and is currently handling over 6,000 customer contacts each week. During times of high demand, there can be delays in getting through to a service agent due to the high volumes of enquiries. The Passport Service webchat is also operational and customers should refresh the page if the icon is grey. A webchat operator is available when the icon is green.</p><p>Whilst there are no current plans to provide an email address or an online form for the submission of complaints, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience in the provision of this essential citizen service.</p><p>The number of formal complaints received by the Passport Service in the years 2017-2022 to date are outlined below in tabular form: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>No. of Passport Service complaints received </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>70 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>27 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>77 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>40 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>371 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 to date </td>       <td>359 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The number of Freedom of Information requests received by the Passport Service in the years 2018-2022 to date are outlined below in tabular form: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>No. of Passport Service FOIs received</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 to date</td>       <td>25</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The number of adult and child applications that were received over three months ago are outlined in tabular form below.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-23a.646.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062300072#WRQ01200"><p>Last month marked the 48th anniversary of the appalling attacks of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in which 33 people were murdered,  the largest loss of life on a single day in the Troubles. Together with the families of those killed and injured, the Taoiseach attended a ceremony in Talbot St to remember those that lost their lives that day.</p><p>The Taoiseach assured those families that the implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings continues to be a priority for the Government, as highlighted in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p><p>The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government. These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.</p><p>We have consistently raised the issues set out in these motions with the British Government, including at the most recent meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference on 23 March last.</p><p>I made clear to my counterpart at the Conference that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government, and that there remains an urgent need for a considered response. </p><p>Following last month&rsquo;s commemoration, the sense of frustration and disappointment at the lack of progress on this issue was conveyed in the strongest terms to the Northern Ireland Office. We reiterated our commitment to finding truth and justice for the innocent victims of the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p><p>The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this issue, at all levels, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p><p>The Government has welcomed the work of Operation Kenova and former Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, who is heading an Independent Police Team to conduct an analytical report on collusion in what has become known as the Glenanne Gang series of cases. This is very relevant to a number of cases including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  </p><p>The Government maintains a close and cooperative relationship with Justice for the Forgotten, as we continue work to seek the full facts of the appalling events of 17 May 1974 and of other attacks in this jurisdiction during the Troubles.</p><p>It is particularly disappointing and concerning that British Government have decided to move away from the Stormont House Agreement and proceed with the introduction of its &lsquo;Northern Ireland Troubles&rsquo; (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, a move which will undoubtedly cause concern and upset for victims, families and survivors on this island. I have voiced my clear opposition to this unilateral move. </p></reply>

The Taoiseach, Ministers, and officials from Dublin and all our embassies continue to meet with our counterparts and stakeholders in the EU institutions and across Member States and globally.  The EU&rsquo;s commitment to Northern Ireland is undiminished.</p><p>I am in ongoing and intensive contact with our partners across the EU, including European Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic, who I spoke to on 13 June about the UK Government&rsquo;s publication of draft legislation on the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. I was in Brussels at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday (20 June), where I met with a number of my EU counterparts.  The Taoiseach spoke with PM Johnson on 10 May, with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on 16 June, and with European Council President Charles Michel on 17 June. Minister of State Byrne is also in close contact with his EU counterparts, including at the General Affairs Council on 21 June, where EU-UK relations were discussed. Opposition to the UK&rsquo;s illegal unilateral action is uniform across the Union and support for the Commission approach remains steadfast. </p><p>I spoke by phone to UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on 13 June at the request of the UK Foreign Office, and expressed my deep disappointment at the UK&rsquo;s proposed illegal actions. I made clear to her that no amount of vague language around protecting the Good Friday Agreement can deny<b></b>the fact that the UK is planning to set aside a solemn agreement and to break international law. Far from fixing the challenges arising from the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK government&rsquo;s legislation will create a whole new set of uncertainties and damage relationships within Northern Ireland, across our islands, between our governments, and between the UK and the EU and its Member States. </p><p>The Government remains in contact, on an ongoing basis, with the US administration and key interlocutors in the United States who retain a keen interest in these developments. We welcomed a bipartisan Congressional Delegation, led by Congressman Richie Neal, to Dublin and Kerry in May. We are grateful for continued bipartisan US support for peace and stability in Northern Ireland throughout the Brexit process. </p><p>Despite the UK tabling its legislation on the Protocol, the EU remains open to talks on finding a joint solution, and has put forward further details on the practical solutions it published last October. We know the operation of the Protocol can be improved. Ireland has stated this clearly, as has the Commission. With political will, there are solutions to be found for the genuine issues of concern to people and business in Northern Ireland.  Finding these solutions will allow Northern Ireland to experience in full the positive effects the Protocol can have on trade, investment, growth and employment.</p></reply>

I also maintain ongoing contact with the parties and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland, as well as with Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic, EU counterparts, and a range of US partners.  </p><p>In contacts with the British Government, I have underlined the Irish Government&rsquo;s deep disappointment at their decision to table legislation to unilaterally disapply parts of the Protocol. Such unilateral action would, if enacted, breach international law. It damages relationships within Northern Ireland, across our islands, between our governments, and between the UK and the EU. </p><p>I underlined that people in Northern Ireland do not support this legislation. We have seen that 52 MLAs have written to PM Johnson expressing &ldquo;in the strongest possible terms&rdquo; their objection to it. Northern Ireland business is clear that they need certainty and stability and that this requires a negotiated settlement. </p><p>Both the Irish Government and European Commission have engaged consistently with Northern Ireland stakeholders, including the Unionist community, to understand their concerns. In October, the Commission presented proposals directly addressing these concerns, but the UK has not seriously engaged with them. Last week, in addition to relaunching infringement proceedings following the UK&rsquo;s actions on the Protocol, the Commission outlined further detail for these proposals. </p><p>Only joint solutions can provide long-term legal certainty and predictability to Northern Ireland. The UK needs to reciprocate the flexibility shown by the EU. I strongly urge the British Government to engage constructively with the EU.</p><p>It is also important that we continue to work to support all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, and the ongoing work of the peace process. The election on 5 May brought with it significant democratic change. It is, first and foremost, a matter for the parties now, and those representatives elected in good faith, to come together to establish an Executive to deliver for all the people of Northern Ireland on the basis of election result, and in a spirit of partnership, equality and mutual respect.</p><p>I hope, as we all do, that we will see those institutions up and running as soon as possible. I will continue to engage with the Secretary of State, other British Government counterparts, and the parties in Northern Ireland, in support of the functioning of all of the Good Friday Agreement institutions and a peaceful and prosperous future for all the people of Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

This policy informs our active approach to peace support operations, crisis management, conflict resolution, and peacebuilding. There are no plans to alter this policy.</p>  <p>  We must recognise however that the world has changed significantly in recent years, and the security and defence challenges we face as a country are not the same as those we faced in previous decades. Cyber and hybrid threats, for example, have emerged as a serious and on-going threat to global, regional, and national security.</p>  <p>  In this context, I believe that a national debate on security and defence policy is needed. We must reflect on the security and defence challenges we face as a country and on ways to respond to those challenges. The Taoiseach has indicated that the issues involved could potentially be discussed through a Citizens Assembly or a similar framework. </p>  <p>  However, it is important that this debate should take place in an open and evidence-based way, and at an appropriate time. As I have said on many occasions, the immediate focus remains on easing the plight of the Ukrainian people and holding the Russian leadership to account.</p></reply>

No amount of vague language around protecting the Good Friday Agreement can deny the fact that the UK is planning to set aside a solemn agreement and to break international law. Far from fixing the challenges arising from the Protocol, the British Government&rsquo;s legislation will create a whole new set of uncertainties and damage relationships within Northern Ireland, across our islands, between our governments, and between the UK and the EU and its Member States.</p>  <p>  I am in regular and ongoing contact with the political parties and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland, both with regard to the Protocol and the restoration of Northern Ireland Executive. Following the Assembly elections in May, both I and the Taoiseach travelled to Northern Ireland to meet with the party leaders and with representatives of the business community. The Government has consistently sought to listen to and engage with the perspectives and concerns of everyone in relation to the Protocol, including those in the unionist community. The European Commission has done likewise and, in October, the Commission presented far-reaching proposals directly addressing these concerns. However, the UK has failed to seriously engage with these proposals.</p>  <p>  I have remained in contact with the business community, civil society representatives, and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland with regard to the Protocol. The clear message that we have heard first hand from people and businesses in Northern Ireland is that they want an agreed solution between the UK and the EU, not unilateral action. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s business community has a real desire to make the most of the opportunities presented by the Protocol, which requires certainty, stability, and predictability. The British Government&rsquo;s recent actions undermine this and create uncertainty for businesses in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In the period ahead, we will continue to engage with the political parties in Northern Ireland, along with business and civil society representatives, both to understand genuine concerns around the implementation of the Protocol and to support the full functioning of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

I described hundreds of family homes, shops and other civilian infrastructure: blackened, burnt, looted, damaged, and- in some cases &ndash; completely destroyed. I described how I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued. 503 civilians had been identified at that stage - and just 4 soldiers.</p>  <p>  Ireland, and our EU partners, are clear on the need for international justice mechanisms to assist in delivering accountability. Ireland is a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and is one of over 40 States Parties to have referred the situation in Ukraine to the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC for the purposes of investigating claims of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  The Prosecutor has now commenced investigation activities in Ukraine which are intended to lead to the prosecution at the ICC of individuals for the commission of crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>  <p>  Another important tool for rapid work on holding Russia accountable has been the use of the Organization for Security Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)&rsquo;s Moscow Mechanism. On 3 March 2022 the Moscow Mechanism was invoked by Ukraine, supported by 45 participating States, including Ireland. Consequently, a Mission of three experts was appointed on 14 March 2022, which delivered its report to Ukraine as the inviting state on 5 April 2022.</p>  <p>  The Mission&rsquo;s mandate was to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding possible contraventions of OSCE commitments, and violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. It was also mandated to establish the facts and circumstances of possible cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity. On 2 June, the Moscow Mechanism was invoked again to build on the report of the first mandate.</p>  <p>  Holding Russia accountable for violations of international law must continue to be pursued by the multilateral system. Ireland has been strong and consistent in using its voice internationally to do so. </p>  <p>  In line with our core principles for our term on the UN Security Council - Building Peace, Strengthening Conflict Prevention and Ensuring Accountability - Ireland continues to use our membership of the Council to hold Russia accountable, to urge it to end its war in Ukraine immediately, and to call out Russia&rsquo;s cynical attempts to use the Council and other UN bodies to spread disinformation.</p>  <p>  At a meeting of the Security Council on 12 May, Ireland called, in particular, for the protection of children and other civilians. At a meeting of the UN Security Council on 6 June, Ireland also highlighted our deep concern about reports of conflict related sexual violence and crimes of trafficking. On 21 June, at a meeting of the Security Council to discuss the issue of incitement to violence leading to atrocities, Ireland called for respect for international law, the protection of civilians, and for Russian withdrawal from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively participate at the Human Rights Council and has repeatedly condemned reports of gross and systematic violations of human rights by Russia. Ireland co-sponsored a Human Rights Council resolution on 4 March establishing an independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate all alleged breaches of human rights and international humanitarian law, and related crimes in the context of Russia&rsquo;s invasion, and with our international partners, also supported the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s decision to suspend Russia&rsquo;s membership rights from the Human Rights Council on 7 April. </p>  <p>  On 16 June, at the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland delivered a strong statement condemning Russia's actions in Mariupol, highlighting the grave humanitarian and human rights consequences of these actions.</p></reply>

If endorsed by the European Council at its meeting of 23-24 June, it will place Ukraine on a firm path towards EU membership, where it belongs. </p>  <p>  As the Opinion states, the aspiration to belong to the European Union has for many years been an important priority for Ukraine, its governments and citizens. It has been an underlying motive for democratic changes over the past decade and a driver of a number of key reforms founded on European values.</p>  <p>  Every sovereign country has a right to determine its own future, free from external pressure and duress. The people of Ukraine have chosen a future in the European Union and they deserve our full support.</p>  <p>  Ireland has long advocated for this outcome and I strongly supported Ukraine's EU perspective at Foreign Affairs Council this week. As I re-iterated when I met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba in April, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership. We have come together with a group of other Member States, with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.</p>  <p>The European Commission Opinion will provide an important signal to the people and Government of Ukraine who have stood firm in defence of our shared European values in the face of the Russia's war of aggression against them. It is a message that Europe stands with them now, that we will continue to stand with them in the future, and that we will support the rebuilding of Ukraine.  </p></reply>

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries.</p>  <p>  There are currently five recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and Serbia. Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and has indicated an intention to submit a formal application for EU membership during 2022. Ukraine applied for membership of the EU on 28 February 2022, while Moldova and Georgia followed suit on 03 March. </p>  <p>  Currently, EU relations with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia are set within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. &lsquo;Association Agreements&rsquo; and &lsquo;Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements&rsquo; (DCFTAs) are in place with all three aimed at promoting deeper political ties, stronger economic links and ensuring respect for common values. While some progress has been made over the years towards closer integration with the EU, progress on reforms has been slow overall.</p>  <p>  Ukraine&rsquo;s application was discussed at the informal European Council meeting on 10 &amp;amp; 11 March 2022. This resulted in the &lsquo;Versailles Declaration&rsquo;, which acknowledged the &ldquo;European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine&rdquo;. The European Council also invited the Commission to submit its opinion on all three applications in accordance with the established procedures, while noting that &ldquo;Ukraine belongs to our European family&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  On 17 June 2022, the Commission presented its Opinions on the EU membership applications submitted by Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova as invited by the Council. The Opinions refer to three sets of criteria: political criteria, economic criteria and the ability of each country to assume the obligations of EU membership.</p>  <p>  In essence, the Commission has recommended that candidate status now be granted to Ukraine and Moldova, on the understanding that reforms are carried out in a number of areas. It was also recommended that candidate status eventually be granted to Georgia, once a number of priority reforms have been addressed, with the Commission to review progress on all three applicants by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Opinions of the Commission in response to these three applications which align very much with our own public pronouncements and internal analysis over recent months. The Taoiseach has already made clear that Ireland wishes to see this week&rsquo;s European Council grant Ukraine and Moldova candidate status. Ireland further hopes that the positive signal given to Georgia by the Commission&rsquo;s Opinion will spur its Government to implement reforms and reverse the democratic backsliding of recent years.</p>  <p>  In the Western Balkans, current issues relating to the enlargement process largely revolve around the commitment to opening Inter-Governmental Conferences (IGCs) with Albania and North Macedonia. The main obstacle to agreement is Bulgaria&rsquo;s continued objection to moving ahead with opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia due to bilateral difficulties related to the Macedonian language, the Bulgarian community in North Macedonia, and the implementation of the 2017 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations. Despite strenuous efforts led by the French Presidency to resolve the dispute, it appears unlikely that Bulgaria will be in a position to lift its veto on the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia in the coming weeks which will undoubtedly represent a further setback for the Enlargement process. </p>  <p>  The EU is continuing to encourage greater reform efforts on the part of Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in relation to Rule of Law and promotion of good governance. Serbia&rsquo;s non-alignment with the EU common position relating to Russia has also been of concern recently.  </p>  <p>Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.  </p></reply>

It is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar which took years to establish. The people of Myanmar have consistently endorsed the democratic path and overwhelmingly reject the military coup.</p>  <p>  Ireland has repeatedly called for the release of all those arbitrarily detained since the coup. At the Human Rights Council in March, Ireland&rsquo;s National Statement specifically raised deep concerns regarding inhumane prison conditions and called for the immediate release of the State Counsellor and President.</p>  <p>  Speaking on behalf of EU Member States, High Representative Borrell has strongly condemned the politically motivated verdicts handed down to Myanmar's leaders including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint. We believe these verdicts represent another step towards the dismantling of the rule of law, a further violation of human rights in Myanmar and an attempt to exclude democratically elected leaders from future political engagement and the inclusive dialogue process called for by ASEAN&rsquo;s Five Point Consensus. </p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaged on the crisis in Myanmar in the context of our role on the United Nations Security Council. The Security Council has considered the situation in Myanmar nine times since the coup. </p>  <p>  At a private meeting of the Security Council on 27 May, Ireland stressed that the international community, and the Security Council, has a responsibility to respond and to support those in Myanmar who are working steadfastly to pursue dialogue, peace and national reconciliation. Ireland is committed to ensuring that the Council continues to engage on this devastating crisis.</p>  <p>  Through the UN and our Embassy network, we are encouraging those who have influence on the military leadership, including ASEAN and countries within the region, to use it to find a political resolution to this crisis and protect the human rights of the Myanmar people. </p></reply>

The war in Ukraine has provoked a significant geopolitical realignment and shown us that we need to deliver on the expectations of the Western Balkans countries, while also strengthening their commitment to European values as future EU Member States. In particular, closer political engagement and practical support to assist with the consequences of the war will be needed in order to bolster the resilience of our Western Balkan Partners.</p>  <p>  As a sign of this continuing priority, an EU-Western Balkans Leaders' meeting will take place in the morning of 23 June 2022, just ahead of the meeting of the European Council. The leaders of the six Western Balkans countries (Albania, Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia) have been invited to meet with the members of the European Council at this meeting. The overall aims of the meeting are to express support for integrating the Western Balkans to the Union; to enhance cooperation with the region; to discuss the enlargement methodology; to discuss geostrategic issues; to deepen people-to-people contacts with; and to promote alignment with EU values and the CFSP.</p>  <p>  I warmly welcome the convening of this important engagement with our Western Balkans partners. The EU is already providing considerable assistance to the Western Balkans to promote the region's resilience in the context of the current Russian aggression against Ukraine, including assistance with promoting greater energy security. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains a strong supporter of enlargement of the European Union, provided that candidate countries meet the necessary conditions for membership. We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in the Western Balkans, and are concerned at the increasing disillusionment with the enlargement process as a whole. In particular, we would like to see accession negotiations opened with Albania and North Macedonia without delay. No other single move could better highlight the EU&rsquo;s prioritisation of the Enlargement Process and ongoing support for the Western Balkans as this. </p></reply>

Ireland supports the European Union (EU), United Nations (UN), and other international efforts to reduce the influence of Boko Haram and al-Shabaab, and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians and humanitarian workers and facilities. Ireland continues to monitor the activities of these groups and to assist populations affected by their actions.</p>  <p>  Through Irish Aid, the Government's official aid programme, Ireland is tackling poverty, hunger, and exclusion, which can be drivers of support for groups such as Boko Haram and al-Shabaab, as well as responding to humanitarian need, in regions affected by conflict. Recipients of Irish Aid funding include Concern Worldwide, Goal, Plan International Ireland, and Trocaire, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and UN agencies and programmes. As an EU Member State, Ireland also contributes to the significant EU development and humanitarian response in countries affected by Boko Haram and al-Shabaab.  </p>  <p>  Since 2015, Irish Aid has allocated over &euro;36 million in bilateral funding to alleviate the conditions of people in distress across the Lake Chad region &ndash; including North-East Nigeria, where the numbers of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection are at the highest levels recorded. In 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s funding in the region included &euro;1 million to support the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, which is managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and provides life-saving assistance to communities affected by the conflict in the north east of the country. In 2021, Ireland also provided an additional &euro;500,000 to UNOCHA to address increasing humanitarian needs in Niger. In 2022, Ireland also supported the ICRC with &euro;2 million in funding for its humanitarian work in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Niger to meet the needs of communities affected by conflict, including those affected by violence from Boko Haram. At the EU, Ireland supports a strong EU humanitarian engagement in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin to address the need of most vulnerable communities. In 2022, the EU has allocated &euro;554 million to respond to the severe needs in the Sahel and Lake Chad region, particularly to address the deteriorating food insecurity and nutrition crisis. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;57 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Somalia, including to communities displaced by conflict from al-Shabaab-held areas. In response to the intensifying drought, Ireland made its contributions to humanitarian pooled funds early this year, to ensure that funding was available in a timely manner, with over &euro;5.1 million in direct humanitarian funding for Somalia so far in 2022. We have also contributed to the EU funding of &euro;348 million for Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, which includes humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to tackle root causes of food insecurity, including climate adaptation and mitigation measures. . With humanitarian needs in these regions remaining acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p>  <p>  Through the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations is helping stabilise the situation in the Lake Chad region. Ireland is penholder, together with Ghana, on the UNOWAS file at the UN Security Council. In its most recent Presidential Statement on peace consolidation in West Africa of 17 August 2021, the Security Council strongly condemned continued attacks against civilians in the region, and both attacks and threats of attacks against schools, children, and educational personnel, including abductions in Nigeria. Additionally, Ireland is a member of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and has observer status at the Sahel Alliance: both are forums which enable donors to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin.  </p>  <p>  The UN-mandated African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), a follow-on mission to the African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which is primarily funded by the EU, assists the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat al-Shabaab. Ireland is supportive of plans to further transition security responsibilities to the Somali Security Forces. Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council, which oversees an arms embargo and other tools to encourage a more peaceful and secure Somalia. This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting development and governance in Somalia, including the strengthening of its institutions. </p>  <p>  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to the civilian mission EUCAP Somalia, including the Head of Mission. In the Sahel, Ireland currently has 20 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali. Ireland also deploys one expert to the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel Niger. Fourteen Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows Ireland to contribute to peace and security, help protect human rights, and put in place conditions for sustainable development.</p></reply>

A Better World, Ireland's international development policy, focuses Irish Aid&rsquo;s work on the advancement of universal access to human rights; including the right to adequate standards of living, the right to healthcare, education, freedom from hunger, and civil and political freedoms. </p>  <p>  Irish Aid helps to combat human rights abuses, and assist vulnerable communities to realise their rights by: Providing access to education, health services, housing and better governance; strengthening developing country institutions, government systems, parliaments, national human rights institutions, and independent media; addressing gender based violence; supporting civil society partners and promoting civil society space; and supporting the protection of human rights defenders. </p>  <p>  Among the geographic areas of focus for our aid programme this year have been Ukraine, the Horn of Africa, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan, as well as countries in the Sahel; all of which are characterised by serious violations of human rights. The 2022 allocation of Official Development Assistance is the highest ever, at &euro;1 billion &ndash; a 20% increase on last year. This allows Ireland to maintain its longstanding focus on promoting the rights of people furthest behind, such as those affected by food insecurity and conflict. This year, given the pressure on global food systems resulting from the war in Ukraine, at least &euro;193 million in Irish Aid funding will go to improving food security and fulfilling the right to freedom from hunger. </p>  <p>  Ireland's ODA is delivered through multilateral organisations such as the UN, funding to Irish civil society organisations, as well as bilateral ODA spent through Irish Embassies abroad. Our funding is complemented by Ireland's political and diplomatic engagement, including on the UN Security Council, and Human Rights Council. Human rights promotion is at the centre of our international diplomacy efforts at the UN, EU and other bodies; and our principled approach in all fora ensures coherence between Ireland's advocacy and the careful investment of the ODA budget. </p></reply>

We will continue to use our term on the Council to highlight injustices, and to call out violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses. </p>  <p>  This includes our work on the broad range of country situations on the Security Council&rsquo;s agenda, including Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iran and the Middle East, and on thematic issues, such as climate and security; women, peace and security; and the protection of civilians in armed conflict. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also active on the Security Council&rsquo;s subsidiary bodies, including the Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security, which we are co-chairing, and the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict. </p>  <p>  One example of this work has been Ireland&rsquo;s efforts at the United Nations to bring an end to the conflict in Ukraine and also to ensure accountability.

Our approach at the Security Council is underpinned by three core principles: Building Peace, Strengthening Conflict Prevention, and Ensuring Accountability. In line with these, our priorities include: highlighting potential drivers of conflict, such as climate and food insecurity; improving peacekeeping mandates; and promoting respect for international law and accountability. We continue to support efforts at the UN Security Council to ensure full respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law. </p>  <p>  The Human Rights Council has a primary role within the United Nations system to promote and protect human rights globally and to address situations of human rights violations. In March this year, Ireland co-sponsored a Human Rights Council resolution establishing an independent Commission of Inquiry to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law and related crimes in the context of Russia&rsquo;s invasion, and supported the UN General Assembly&rsquo;s decision to suspend Russia&rsquo;s membership rights from the Human Rights Council on 7 April. </p>  <p>  The International Criminal Court (ICC) promotes and upholds accountability and the rule of law by providing a means to bring to account the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. Ireland, together with its EU partners, has been a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC and will continue to support its important work. As part of our support for the Court, on 14 April I announced that Ireland will make a voluntary contribution of &euro;3 million to the ICC, &euro;1 million of which has already been distributed to the Office of the Prosecutor.  This contribution will be used to benefit the ICC&rsquo;s work across all situation countries. </p></reply>

It remains a key part of the Withdrawal Agreement, under which the UK left the EU, and paved the way for the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  As such, it continues to have Ireland&rsquo;s full support, as well as the backing of all EU member states. </p>  <p>  The Protocol is also supported by people and businesses in Northern Ireland. The Protocol gives Northern Ireland unique access to both the EU Single Market as well as the rest of the UK internal market, which combined comprise over half a billion people. The message I have consistently heard from Northern Ireland is that there is a real desire to make the most of the opportunities this presents. People and business want continued access to both the EU and GB markets, and predictability and stability. The UK Government&rsquo;s unilateral actions undermine these objectives and create unwelcome uncertainty for Northern Ireland businesses. </p>  <p>  The Government continues to undertake a coordinated and consistent approach in support of our Brexit priorities, which includes working with the Commission to find jointly agreed solutions to the challenges around the implementation of the Protocol.</p>  <p>  I am in ongoing and intensive contact with my counterparts across the EU, including European Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic, who I spoke with on 13 June. I am also in regular contact with the UK Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The EU&rsquo;s commitment to Northern Ireland is undiminished.  There is strong opposition to the UK&rsquo;s illegal unilateral action and full support for the Commission approach. </p>  <p>  We know the operation of the Protocol can be improved. Ireland has stated this clearly, as has the Commission. That is why the EU has put forward practical solutions to the genuine concerns that have been raised in Northern Ireland. These are bespoke arrangements that further demonstrate the flexibility the EU is willing to show - including an openness to further change its own rules.  </p>  <p>  The EU is willing to discuss these solutions with the British government. With political will, there are solutions to be found for the genuine issues of concern to people and business in Northern Ireland.  Finding these solutions will allow Northern Ireland to experience in full the positive effects the Protocol can have on trade, investment, growth and employment.</p></reply>

The gains of the peace process have been exceptional and it is our responsibility both to safeguard them, and to build upon them into the future.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks and months, there have undoubtedly been a number of issues that have been very challenging.</p>  <p>  The UK Government published legislation yesterday to replace the Human Rights Act. It will take time review it in detail and consider its proposed provisions, along with other relevant Government Departments. The incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK domestic law was a critical part of the Good Friday Agreement. The rights protections afforded by the ECHR and the Human Rights Act have been essential in creating confidence in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political, policing and judicial structures over the past 24 years.</p>  <p>  We are very concerned by any potential diminution of human rights protection in Northern Ireland that might arise from this, which may impact upon the crucial trust in the Agreement and the protections that it extends to citizens in Northern Ireland. We have underlined that concern to the British Government in the context of the review established in 2020 to examine the framework of the Human Rights Act, including at the most recent meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We will continue to engage with the British Government to ensure that the rights and protections as guaranteed by the Good Friday Agreement are fully maintained into the future.</p>  <p>  The system of government at Stormont is at the centre of the Good Friday Agreement and it is paramount that the institutions of power-sharing are restored. It is for the parties now, and those representatives that have been elected by the people, to come together to get the Assembly up and running, the NI Executive established and the NSMC fully operational again, and the Irish Government will continue to work to support these vital goals. I have remained and continue to remain in regular contact with the parties in Northern Ireland following the Assembly elections, and have also been in contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is vital that nothing is done to undermine political stability in Northern Ireland, and that we work collectively in support of all the institutions of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The UK Government&rsquo;s decision to table legislation to unilaterally dis-apply elements of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is disappointing and deeply concerning. The Protocol was designed and agreed by the UK and the EU to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions and to mitigate the inevitable disruption arising for the island of Ireland from Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Protocol fully recognises the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It protects North South cooperation and the all-island economy, the gains of the peace process which benefit communities North and South, and ensures &lsquo;no diminution of rights, safeguards, or equality of opportunity&rsquo; as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  </p>  <p>  The fundamental purpose of the Protocol is to protect the Good Friday Agreement. Arguing that the Protocol and the Good Friday Agreement are incompatible is disingenuous and irresponsible. Taken together, they are a powerful expression of what negotiation and partnership can achieve.</p>  <p>  A constructive and solution-focussed approach is needed from all concerned, and the Government has communicated that message clearly and strongly to the UK Government.</p>  <p>  It is also a matter of real concern that the British government has chosen to introduce legislation on the legacy of the past, unilaterally, moving away from the process agreed in the Stormont House Agreement. We have profound concerns both on the substance of the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill and the process of its introduction, and are deeply conscious that it has been strongly opposed by victims, by the Northern Ireland parties, and by civil society groups. There are also serious questions with regard to the Bill's compliance with international human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  The Government has communicated our concerns and continues to engage with the UK Government and others on this most sensitive issue as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>The Government will continue to do all in its power to work together with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to work for lasting peace, deeper reconciliation and a prosperous future for all the people of Northern Ireland.  </p></reply>

Ireland actively engages in these discussions in addition to co-chairing the Security Council&rsquo;s Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security. UN Security Council resolution 2331 on Islamic State, recognised the trafficking of women and girls in conflicts as a form of violence against women. Ireland also actively engages on this issue at the UN Human Rights Council and Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. </p><p>My Department is a strong supporter of the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, especially women and children, and regularly meets with the current holder of the mandate, Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally. </p><p>Most recently, on 22 June, Special Rapporteur Mullally presented her report on Trafficking in persons in the agriculture sector. Ireland made a submission to the Special Rapporteur during the research stage and delivered a national statement during the interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the Report&rsquo;s findings. We also co-sponsored a side event hosted by the Special Rapporteur on the subject of her report. The Special rapporteur regularly issues statements and produces country-reports which are available at <i>www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/sr-trafficking-in-persons/country-visits</i>, along with the reports of previous mandate holders.  </p><p>At EU level, combating trafficking is a key priority in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024.  The Plan&rsquo;s objectives include promoting measures to prevent and fully eradicate trafficking in human beings, including by countering impunity for all perpetrators involved. On 14 April 2021, the Commission adopted a new EU Strategy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings (2021-2025) and the ongoing evaluation of the Anti-trafficking Directive aims to update the EU legal framework to ensure efficiency in addressing the current challenges.</p><p>Finally, Ireland provides core funding to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). IOM works in partnership with governments, the United Nations, international and non-governmental organizations, the private sector and development partners on all aspects of counter-trafficking responses: prevention, protection, and prosecution.  </p></reply>

The new assessment arrangements under the Framework for Junior Cycle on the other hand require all students to engage in an assessment of their oral skills through Classroom Based Assessment. This gives a greater opportunity for <b>all</b>students to develop and enhance their oral language proficiency skills over the three years of Junior Cycle and to foster their ability to use the Irish language.</p><p>With effect since 2017, as part of the Framework for Junior Cycle, Junior Cycle provision for Irish in post-primary schools and settings comprises two new specifications. The L1 (Language 1, in Irish, Teanga 1) specification is targeted at students in Irish-medium schools and students in English-medium schools who learn one or more subjects (apart from Irish) through the medium of Irish. The L2 (Language 2, Teanga 2) specification is targeted at other students in English-medium schools. </p><p>The new specifications (both L1 and L2) have a strong emphasis on oral language. This is particularly highlighted in the main strand of the specifications &ndash; Communicative Competence. This strand places an enhanced emphasis on Irish as the language of learning and communication in classrooms as well as an emphasis on the skills required to communicate effectively with other users of the language. Communication, opportunities for use and interaction are central to classroom tasks. </p><p>The assessment of these skills forms an integral component of the overall language learning experience and occurs in a number of ways. As well as the completion of tasks where students use and demonstrate their oral language skills to achieve specific learning outcomes, their oral language skills are also formally assessed through the two new Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs). The second Classroom-Based Assessment in particular is entirely based on students&rsquo; oral language competence. The CBA is linked to ongoing classroom exchanges and represents a more authentic reflection of students&rsquo; interests and competence levels in Irish. Importantly, the oral skills of all students are now assessed in classroom-based assessments and formally reported upon in each students&rsquo; Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.  Unlike the previous reporting format in which candidates receive one overall grade based on their achievement in Irish in the Junior Certificate, whether they undertake the optional oral or not, the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement allows students&rsquo; achievement in the CBAs to be recorded independently of the result in the state-certified examination.</p><p>These new arrangements provide a greater opportunity for students to develop their oral language proficiency skills. </p><p>My Department remains committed to encouraging the use of spoken Irish.  The development of the new curriculum specifications for Irish at Junior Cycle was informed by research and extensive consultation with the education partners including practising teachers and students. Extensive continuing professional development (CPD) provided to teachers is complemented by a range of other supports. The new approach gives better recognition to the development of students&rsquo; oral competence, including their ability to speak Irish, over the three-years of Junior Cycle.</p><p>As is the case with all of the specifications developed under the Junior Cycle Framework, the NCCA reviews the enactment of subject specification by conducting interim reviews once each subject specification has been experienced across the three-year span of their Junior Cycle. The purpose of such reviews is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on their experiences of the new specifications. In February 2021, the NCCA opened a public consultation on draft L1 and L2 specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish. In response to subsequent stakeholder requests, the NCCA extended the timeline for this consultation and also undertook to conduct and early enactment review of the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. Accordingly, the NCCA commissioned Dublin City University to conduct this review which I am advised is expected to be completed later this year. The draft report, will in due course, be presented to NCCA Council for consideration. </p></reply>

It participates in international networks, engages in research, prepares discussion papers and consultation papers, engages in development work with schools, provides policy advice, and prepares specifications for approval by my Department. Consultation with stakeholders is a key part of its work.  </p>  <p>  Following extensive stakeholder consultation, new L1 and L2 specifications for Junior Cycle Irish were introduced in September 2017. Due the disruption to learning and cancellation of the summer 2020 and 2021 Junior Cycle examinations as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic it was not possible for students to engage with the final assessment component which is set by the State Examinations Commission until this year. The cohort of students who have just this past fortnight taken Junior Cycle examinations are therefore the first to have engaged with the full range of learning and assessment experiences in line with the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum redevelopment, the NCCA reviews the enactment of subject specifications by conducting interim reviews once each subject specification has been experienced across the three-year span of their Junior Cycle. The purpose of such reviews is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on their experiences of the new specifications. </p>  <p>  In February 2021, the NCCA opened a public consultation on draft L1 and L2 specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish. In response to subsequent stakeholder requests, the NCCA extended the timeline for this consultation and also undertook to conduct an early enactment review of the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. Accordingly, the NCCA commissioned Dublin City University to conduct this review which I am advised is expected to be completed later this year. The draft report, will in due course, be presented to NCCA Council for consideration. </p></reply>

These include short, unannounced inspections and medium-scale evaluations which cover specific aspects of the work of schools, such as, the quality of learning and teaching in subjects and curriculum areas, the leadership of curriculum and assessment, the quality of engagement with children and young people and their parents, and the provision for children with special educational needs.</p><p>Comprehensive Whole-School type inspections, including both Whole-School Evaluations and Evaluations of Action Planning for Improvement in DEIS schools, are also included in the suite of evaluation models. This ensures that the Inspectorate can respond to particular quality assurance needs across the school system and provide evidence-based policy advice for Ministers taking school size and other context factors into account. Because of their significant scope and resource intensity, Whole school evaluations (WSE) are employed strategically rather than in accordance with a specific chronological cycle.</p><p>The strategic objective is to ensure that a balanced, national evaluation programme is delivered using a proportionate, risk-based approach to inspection. This approach informs inspection planning priorities in Early Learning and Care settings and in primary and post-primary schools, and it has contributed to improved inspection coverage, as well as more customised, risk-informed use of inspection nationally. </p><p>An inspection visit is conducted in primary and special schools at least once in four years, on average. Prior to the pandemic in 2018 and 2019 when the normal inspection programme was operating, a total of 1,646 inspections, including 218 whole-school evaluations, were carried out in the 3,241 primary and special schools in the country. (See Table 1 below). </p><p>An inspection visit is conducted in post-primary schools at least once in two years, on average. In 2018 and 2019, when the normal inspection programme was operating, a total of 1,264 inspections was carried out in the 730 post-primary schools in the country. (See Table 2 below). </p><p>During the pandemic, the Inspectorate continued to achieve a high level of coverage in its inspection and advisory engagements with schools in 2020 and 2021, notably through a customised inspection programme that included inspections to support the safe provision of schooling, incidental inspections and urgent inspections such as child protection and safeguarding inspections (CPSI). In 2020 and 2021, a total of 2,542 inspections was carried out in primary schools and special schools (Table 1). During the same two-year period, a total of 1,104 inspections was carried out in post-primary schools (Table 2). </p><p>The attached document provides the full text answer and the supporting tables.</p><p><a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-06-23_pq346-23-06-22_en.docx">Schools Inspections</a></p></reply>

The ancillary accommodation needs of primary schools, such as General Purpose rooms will also be considered.</p>  <p>  My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification. My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach. This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware of the very significant school building programme that is currently underway.  Overall, there are in excess of 1,300 school building projects at various stages of design, planning, and construction. The current status of approved projects under the school building programme is listed on a county by county basis on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and is regularly updated. </p></reply>

Where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software for students from normal school resources or funds.</p>  <p>  An investment programme of &euro;210m has been delivered to schools under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015 &ndash;2020.  Additionally, the first tranche of the successor Digital Strategy for schools to 2027, ICT grant funding of &euro;50m has recently issued to schools. Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school, as schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. The grant funding allocation issues directly to schools and can be used to provide devices for use by students and teachers, for learning platforms, software and overall digital technology infrastructure development in the school.  In addition, my Department as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) under Next Generation EU funding facility, to provide for a scheme for learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide, issued a once-off grant in December 2021 to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme. This funding also issued directly to schools as they are best placed to determine the needs of their own cohort.</p>  <p>  Where children with more complex disabilities require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum, which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the schools existing provisions, schools may make an application for such equipment to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) under the terms of this scheme.</p>  <p>  The NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. SENO&rsquo;s also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the Assistive Technology Scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum.</p>  <p>  SENO&rsquo;s will review the application, and professional reports provided in support of same, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided.</p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the Assistive Technology Scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>  Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are not provided for under the Assistive Technology Scheme, however. Such equipment is normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  Based on the professional information provided to the SENO and in line with criteria set out in Circular 10/2013, the SENO was not in a position to recommend an Assistive Technology Grant for the school concerned on behalf of the two students mentioned.</p>  <p>  It is open to the school to appeal this decision. The appeals process is outlined on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: gov.ie - Assistive Technology Grant (www.gov.ie)</p>  <p>  Separately, where an appeal has been unsuccessful, but new information becomes available, it is open to the school to submit a new application to the SENO for consideration.</p>  <p>  It is also open to parents to contact SENOs directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available at: ncse.ie/seno-contact-information</p></reply>

All migrant children, including children of international protection applicants, refugees, migrant workers and unaccompanied minors, can access pre-school, primary and post-primary education in a manner similar to Irish nationals, until they have reached the age of 18 years.</p>  <p>  A school must admit all students applying where it is not oversubscribed and places are available. Schools must also include an admission statement in its admission policy stating that the school will not discriminate in its admission on any of nine specified grounds. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education is working with all relevant authorities, education partners and school communities to ensure Ukrainian children of school-going age, who are beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection Directive, are provided with access to appropriate supports to allow them to continue their education in Ireland.   This directive assures their right to education in the public education system, along with other rights, for a temporary period, on the same basis as EU citizens.</p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching allocation, as outlined in Circular 0020/2022, (primary schools) and 0021/2022 (post primary schools) provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile and also encompasses the Language Support (EAL) allocation that schools were allocated in previous years.  </p>  <p>  Many schools already have an existing Special Education Teaching allocation which also includes the EAL allocation, and further temporary Language Support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support.</p>  <p>  The staffing arrangements for primary and post primary schools for the 2022/23 school year are set out in Circular 0025/2022 (primary) and Circulars 0022/2022, 0023/2022 and 0024/2022 (post primary),  and are available on the Department website.</p></reply>

Firstly, to ensure the efficacy and reliability of the PSC as proof of identity, the photograph on the PSC must be updated every 10 years, as is the case with other photo IDs such as passports and driving licences. This 10-year standard is in line with internationally agreed guidelines on photo IDs.</p>  <p>  Secondly, the automatic issuing of large volumes of PSCs, containing a person&rsquo;s name, photograph, signature and PPSN would create a significant risk of personal data breach, were the cards to become lost or delivered to a former address of a customer, where that customer has not informed the Department they have moved.</p>  <p>  When a person&rsquo;s PSC expires, there are a number of ways in which they can get a new card.</p>  <p>  Intreo Centres and Branch Offices reopened countrywide following the lifting of public health restrictions earlier this year, and almost 147,000 PSC appointments have taken place so far this year; this includes over 23,000 PSC renewal appointments.  Any person who wishes to make an appointment to renew their PSC can contact their local Intreo Centre or Branch Office.</p>  <p>  My Department also introduced an online PSC renewal service in March 2021. This service is available on MyWelfare.ie and 15,000 people have renewed their PSC online so far this year.   </p>  <p>  In addition, as part of my Department&rsquo;s response during the pandemic, a facility was introduced whereby a person can have the validity period of their PSC extended by three years, by calling to an office of the Department or by calling 1890 927 999.   These extended cards, issued on request, use the existing photograph, and do not necessitate attendance at an in-person appointment.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that holders of expired free travel PSCs have at all times retained their entitlement to free travel.  For this reason, there is an interim arrangement in place with the National Transport Authority, whereby expired free travel cards are accepted for travel on public transport services.  Expired PSCs can also continue to be used to collect social welfare payments in Post Offices nationwide, and to verify MyGovID accounts. </p>  <p>  The Department is currently reviewing the issuing of PSC expiry notifications with the aim of making the notification process more efficient. Any decision as to the resumption of the issuing of expiry notifications will be taken within the context of the Department&rsquo;s available resources and the ongoing requirements to comply with the prevailing HSE and WHO public health and social distancing guidelines.</p></reply>

Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. </p><p>Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.</p><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that within my Department, a dedicated Ukraine Response Division has been newly established. The team includes more than 80 staff. The majority of these staff have moved from within the Department with consequent impacts on ongoing work priorities. The Division also includes new staff and those seconded from other Departments and Agencies.</p><p>I want to recognise the hard work and commitment of Department staff in providing accommodation for so many people in such a short period, as well as maintaining work progress in other key areas. Many staff have volunteered their own time, at night and on weekends, to work in the welcome centre in Citywest to provide that immediate welcome to people fleeing Ukraine as they arrive here. </p><p>I want to acknowledge the staff from other Departments also working in Citywest - including those from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Justice as well as medical staff from the HSE.  </p><p>My Department and its staff will continue in their efforts to assist those arriving as best they can. </p><p>Public Representatives can contact ukrainetempaccom@equality.gov.ie.</p><p>The main units and workstreams of the Ukraine Programme Management office are detailed below:</p><p>Ukraine Programme Management Office &ndash; Workstreams <table>    <tr>       <td>Reporting and Data Management</td>       <td>Coordination and Management</td>       <td>Communications and Stakeholders</td>       <td>Policy, Governance and Parliamentary Affairs</td>       <td>Pledge Project</td>       <td>Procurement</td>       <td>Reception and Movement  Infrastructure</td>       <td>Accommodation Operations</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The income figures were assessed on figures provided by Revenue and DEASP. The applicant has opted for a manual assessment, which will allow the applicant to provide their own proof of income which may differ from the figures provided by both Revenue and DEASP. </p><p>There is a dedicated support centre for parents who have queries in relation to the NCS. Parents can contact the Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday 9am-5pm, or to visit www.ncs.gov.ie</p><p>A number of extensions to the NCS were announced in the last Budget.  Firstly, from 2 May, the NCS no longer deducts hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours. </p><p>Secondly, from 22 August 2022, the upper age eligibility for the NCS Universal Award will change from 3 years to 15 years. This means that the minimum rate for an NCS Award will be raised to 50 cents for all children under 15, which for full time childcare equates to a parental subsidy of over &euro;1, 100 per annum.</p></reply>

The new model will co-ordinate a two phase system of accommodation and supports that ensures people who are applying for protection are helped integrate into Ireland from day one, with health, housing, education, and employment supports at the core of the new system. All families will be offered own-door accommodation, while single people will be offered own-room accommodation. Congregated accommodation settings will be phased out and the accommodation will be managed by independent not-for-profit organisations operating on behalf of the State.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the White Paper my department has placed a significant focus on delivering the new model of accommodation and supports for International Protection. The progress to date has included:</p>  <p>  - Establishment of a dedicated transition team within my department to drive implementation of the programme;</p>  <p>  - Development of a detailed implementation plan including inputs from other key stakeholders who have a responsibility for delivering services to International Protection applicants;</p>  <p>  - Governance structures established to oversee transition to the new model in the form of a Programme Board and an External Advisory Committee. The membership of the Programme Board includes a representative with lived experience of International Protection and representatives of non-governmental organisations. The Board has met regularly over the past twelve months to review progress;</p>  <p>  - Significant progress has been made on the establishment of the new accommodation model.  This work has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy, an ownership model and a funding model. Proposals in relation to the ownership model were brought to the Programme Board in November 2021 and approved by myself in January 2022. Work is also ongoing to develop a funding model for Approved Housing Bodies to support them in building a pipeline of Phase Two accommodation. </p>  <p>  - The County and City Management Association has developed and approved a Local Authority allocation key. The key allows for a distribution of applicants across the country according to population criteria.  DCEDIY and the Housing Agency are using the allocation key to identify suitable properties for purchase for Phase Two accommodation.</p>  <p>  - The Housing Agency has proceeded to source a range of properties for Phase Two accommodation and has acquired an initial number to date. Work to source and acquire properties will continue for the remainder of 2022.  </p>  <p>  - Work is also moving ahead on developing the system of income support that applicants will receive when moving into Phase Two accommodation. A policy paper has been developed and work is now proceeding to design the operational structures for the payment.</p>  <p>  - The Transition Team is also developing an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out in the White Paper. In collaboration with the Local Authorities there has been a focus on designing the supports that will be required at a local level.</p>  <p>  - Work is ongoing to launch an integration fund in the coming months which will fund civil society organisations to support the integration of International Protection applicants;</p>  <p>  - Development of a Communication strategy including in February 2022 the launch of a dedicated webpage where all members of the Public can find updates on the progress being made in implementing the White Paper. </p>  <p>  As will be appreciated, the war in Ukraine has had an unavoidable impact on timelines for implementation of the White Paper, as staff in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were temporarily diverted to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations including members of the White Paper Transition Team. At the end of May upwards of 33,000 Ukrainian refugees have come to Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive, and over 23,000 have been accommodated by the State.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks, a review will be undertaken of project timelines with a view to presenting a revised implementation plan to the Programme Board.  This will take account of the delays that have arisen as a consequence of the Ukraine crisis and will consider its impacts on project implementation. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the impact of the Ukraine crisis, the implementation of the new model is and will continue to be a key priority for my department.</p></reply>

To date, more than 35,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 25,000 of those have been referred to this Department seeking accommodation from the State. </p>  <p>  Arrivals continue on a daily basis, and the Government remains committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response, and within the framework of the relevant European Directives. </p>  <p>  Given the scale of the crisis the State is responding to with the large number of people looking for assistance it is not possible to facilitate requests for accommodation of a certain type or in a particular location except on specific medical or disability grounds. </p>  <p>  Refusals of suitable accommodation place significant additional pressures on the system, negatively impacts on the State's ability to provide accommodation for continuing numbers of new arrivals, and leads to inefficiencies managing a limited resource in a time of great emergency. </p>  <p>  The Refusals Policy which is now in place seeks both to respect an individual&rsquo;s right to opt out of the State-sponsored scheme and make their own accommodation arrangements, availing of supports provided by other Departments as appropriate, and to ensure equitable treatment of all arrivals to the greatest extent possible. </p>  <p>  Where an individual refuses an offer of suitable accommodation, they will be placed at the end of the queue and in due course will be made a second and final offer of accommodation. Where that second offer of suitable accommodation is refused, it will remain available but no further offers of accommodation will be made. It is important to emphasise that no one is left without an offer of accommodation. </p>  <p>  This Refusals Policy was developed in consultation with a range of stakeholders, including with the assistance of the Ukrainian Embassy in Dublin, is communicated in English and Ukrainian at various locations, and will be kept under review. Should an individual have queries or questions in relation to the policy, clarifications may be sought on site with officials, or via ukrainetempaccom@equality.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Finally, this Refusals Policy in no way impacts an individual&rsquo;s entitlements to access other supports available to them under the BOTP (Beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection order) scheme e.g. social welfare payments, access to medical care etc.  </p></reply>

There are many other research funders in the national system, including Teagasc and the Health Research Board. There are also typically a number of PhDs funded through European Programmes.</p>  <p>  Impact 2030: Ireland&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Strategy prioritises the nurturing and development of talent and excellence to build on Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an Island of Talent and a location for research excellence and impact. We recognise that the quality of our researchers is fundamental to the quality of our research system and its collaboration with partners in industry and policymakers, both in Ireland and abroad.  </p>  <p>  Our priority under Impact 2030 is to ensure a consistent research student experience, regardless of funding source. This reflects the National Framework for Doctoral Education which is being advanced by the associated National Advisory Forum which is co-chaired by two agencies under the remit of my Department: the Higher Education Authority and Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p>  <p>  A stipend is a well-established feature of funded postgraduate awards globally, providing an income to the awardee in recognition of the need to devote themselves on a full-time basis to their research. </p>  <p>  According to the latest data from the HERD Survey, Irish HEIs had 2,120 internally-funded PhD and Research Master students in 2018. In the HERD Survey, 'Internally-funded' includes students who receive stipends, who are wholly funded by their institution's internal scheme (Recurrent Grant), who get only fees paid by the HEI, and staff who are doing PhDs/Master's in their own HEI. </p>  <p>  The HERD Survey is undertaken every two years to monitor the level of research and development activities in the higher education sector.  Its latest iteration was published in January 2021 and can be accessed on:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/00d67-higher-education-research-and-development-survey-2018-2019/.</p>  <p>  The next HERD survey is currently in the field and will be published in December 2022.</p>  <p>  There were 2,022 PhD Students directly attributed to active SFI awards in 2021, as reported by SFI funded researchers through the SFI Research Outputs Survey 2021.  These are PhD student positions that have been funded through an SFI award.</p>  <p>  The Irish Research Council is currently supporting 920 PhD researchers across its range of funding programmes.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p><p>Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<ol type="1"><li>Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39  etc.);</li><li>Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</li><li>Agency roles working in the HSE;</li><li>Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</li><li>Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</li><li>Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</li></ol>The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  Under the rules of the scheme, a person is assessed on the basis of their income and assets. Up to 80% of a person's income and 7.5% of the value of their assets per year must be paid towards their cost of care. Legislative amendments are currently being brought forward to apply a lower rate of assessment, at 40%, to rental income from a person's principal residence. This measure will reduce a disincentive against renting out a home that would otherwise remain vacant.</p>  <p>  If an individual wishes to make their home available, including refugees, and derives no income from the arrangement, then this will have no impact on their financial assessment.</p></reply>

Validation is the process whereby hospitals contact patients on waiting lists in writing at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend for hospital care or wish to be removed from the waiting list. For a number of years validation was conducted at individual hospital level in Ireland but in September 2018 the Minister for Health approved the establishment of the validation function within the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across hospitals and across Inpatient and Day Case (IPDC) and Outpatient (OPD) waiting lists. </p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised my Department that the following cohorts of patients are included in the Validation Programme for 2022:</p>  <p>  -  Active patients on Inpatient, Daycase (IPDC), GI Scope and Outpatient (OP) waiting lists over 6 months without a TCI or an appointment date.</p>  <p>  -  Active patients on Inpatient, Daycase, GI scope and Outpatient waiting lists over 6 months with a TCI or appointment date outside the six week timeframe from the date of the report.</p>  <p>  -  Patients who fail to respond to Outpatient Commissioning Offer letters.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the NTPF have advised that updated validation guidance was issued to hospitals to include patients in excess of 3 months in validation programmes where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The process, developed by the NTPF, HSE, and my Department, in consultation with stakeholders and experts, involves patients receiving a letter from their hospital, asking them to return the letter in the freepost envelope supplied or reply online, indicating whether they still require their procedure/appointment.</p>  <p>  Those patients who still require a procedure or appointment will remain on the waiting list. Those who respond that they no longer require the procedure will be removed from the waiting list in accordance with the National Inpatient, Day Case, Planned Procedure (IDPP) Protocol 2017 and the National Outpatient Waiting List Management Protocol 2022. Where no response is received within two weeks, a reminder letter is sent and if there is no response within a further two weeks, the patient and the patient&rsquo;s GP will receive a letter advising that the patient has been removed from the waiting list. If the patient or GP considers the procedure or appointment is still required, the patient will be reinstated, maintaining their original place on the list.</p>  <p>  In an effort to improve efficiencies in the national validation process, and provide a convenient, secure response option for patients participating in validation, the NTPF developed and rolled out an additional Patient Online Automated Response option (POLAR). Patients can now go online via POLAR and provide up to date information in relation to their waiting list status; alternatively, they can still use the pre-paid envelope provided</p>  <p>  In terms of categorisation used for recording purposes, validation activity and statistics are recorded by the NTPF and shared to my Department as per the cohorts of patients validated, with patients listed based on the type of waiting lists on which they sit (IPDC/OPD). For the purposes of responding to Parliamentary Question No.1814 of 14 June 2022, the NTPF provided an annual and year-to-date breakdown of validation by hospital and by IPDC/OPD waiting list. The validation process is carried out through cycles where the NTPF works with individual hospitals, via specified waiting lists, in order to identify appropriate patient cohorts to validate, generate reports, contact patients, allow for response time, response collation, and patient removal. As such a breakdown of validation figures by hospital each month does not reflect the appropriate activity and removal rates of the validation cycle. In addition, to generate such a report would require significant manual intervention as it does not correlate with how the validation process operates in practice.</p></reply>

It is designed to attract highly skilled workers from outside the EEA to Ireland, to meet skills demand in the economy where those skills can&rsquo;t be accessed through the resident labour force, in the short to medium term.  This objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. The system is vacancy led and managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where it is evidenced that there is more than sufficient availability of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.</p>  <p>  Pharmacists wishing to practice in Ireland must be registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI &ndash; the Pharmacy Regulator). The number of registered pharmacists on the Register of Pharmacists held and maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator has continued to grow steadily, with an average increase of 187 registrants each year over the past five years. 6846 pharmacists are currently registered with the PSI, under established processes based in Irish and EU law.</p>  <p>  Although not having a direct role in the recruitment of pharmacist the PSI are aware of reports from stakeholders, of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce, with the concern being that the issue may be exacerbated into the future. This has a knock-on impact on pharmacist vacancies, and potentially on continuity and consistency of service. As a result, the PSI is undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23, &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. In 2022, this project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be pleased to hear that I support the inclusion of pharmacists on the critical skills occupations list and that Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Damien English TD, has recently announced changes made by Statutory Instrument to the employment permits system which includes adding the occupation of Pharmacist to the Critical Skills Occupations List.  This means that Pharmacists are now eligible for a Critical Skills Employment Permit.</p></reply>

Funding of approximately &euro;9m has been allocated for this in Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  The scheme will provide for:</p>  <p>  - The cost of prescription contraception;</p>  <p>  - The cost of necessary consultations with medical professionals to discuss suitable contraception for individual patients and to enable prescription of same;</p>  <p>  - The cost of fitting and/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit/remove same;</p>  <p>  - The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs;</p>  <p>  - The cost of providing the wide range of contraceptive options currently available to GMS (medical) card holders, which will also be available through this scheme, including contraceptive injections, implants, IUS and IUDs (coils), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.</p>  <p>  - The scheme will be open to all 17-25 year-olds ordinarily resident in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Formal consultations with medical representative bodies with regard to service provision under the scheme have commenced and are ongoing. Following advice from the Attorney General's office regarding the legal framework for the scheme, consideration is being given to providing this by way of primary legislation.</p>  <p>  The design of citizen engagement information and publicity campaigns to support and promote the roll out of the scheme will be finalised in the coming months, to be launched in the month preceding and during the initial phase of scheme roll-out.</p>  <p>  The regulatory framework in Ireland does not currently permit dispensing the Pill without a prescription; amending this would require expert clinical input. It is not envisaged that this could be considered prior to the launch of the scheme, given the tight timelines involved.</p>  <p>  Some access to free contraception is already enabled in some contexts. the National Condom Distribution Service (NCDS), which was established by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) in October 2015 and functions as a central point for distributing free condoms and lubricant sachets to HSE services and other organisations working with individuals and groups at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes. The NCDS was expanded to 3rd level campuses in 2019 and will continue to operate in this context. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, while oral contraception and various forms of long-acting reversible contraception can be more effective at preventing pregnancy, condoms provide protection against STIs that is not provided by non-barrier forms of contraception. It is envisaged that continued expansion of the NCDS will be facilitated in line with demand, in order to support the STI prevention and sexual health promotion needs of people living in Ireland.</p></reply>

I also fully acknowledge that community pharmacists have played a vital role in responding to the health needs of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Community pharmacists have ensured the continued availability of a professional, accessible service for the public and have successfully managed to alleviate concerns around continuity of medicine supply. They have also played a central role in the national vaccination rollout &ndash; the largest ever undertaken by the State.</p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures. This group &ndash; now called the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum &ndash; had examined the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency and played a key role in resolving them to the benefit of the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The work of the Forum has now transitioned to discussing the strategic direction of the community pharmacy profession. These discussions will bring clarity to the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. The central objective of Sl&aacute;inteCare is providing the right care, in the right place, at the right time. This means providing more care to patients in the communities in which they live. Community pharmacists will play a vital and increasing role in delivering this care.</p>  <p>  The ongoing work of the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum will also prove invaluable in the context of future contractual reform. Of course, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services, and provide better value for money.</p>  <p>  I believe there is a real opportunity to work collaboratively, and with other healthcare providers, to make a significant difference to patient outcomes. I welcome the ongoing work of the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum in that regard.</p></reply>

The NSAC has commissioned HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) looking at the addition of other SCID types to the NBS programme. This HTA is underway and I am looking forward to receiving a recommendation from the Committee on this condition after the HTA process is finalised later this year.</p>  <p>  The NSAC is now well established and recently published its second annual report which detailed significant progress in 2021. The Committee's first Annual Call for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received, including on newborn screening. Submissions were received from various sources and are now undergoing consideration by the committee. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme later this year once it has considered all proposals submitted.</p>  <p>  Given that this is a complex area, careful consideration must be given to the expansion of the NBS programme and these things can take time, however, it is important that decisions are made based on internationally accepted criteria and scientific rigour.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult it is for parents whose children have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them, their families and their children. It can be an overwhelming situation and can be very isolating for many families because of the significant work that is involved when a rare disease is diagnosed. I am committed to the further expansion of newborn screening in Ireland and in identifying opportunities for future additions to it.</p></reply>

This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. </p>  <p>  There has been a clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises. As the Deputy will be aware, I established a Public Health Reform Expert Advisory Group in January 2022. The Expert Group will initially focus on identifying learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland with a view towards strengthening health protection generally and future public health pandemic preparedness specifically. It is important that we have a strong and robust embedded public health system into the future.</p>  <p>  Both myself and Minister Butler remain fully committed to the continued improvement of older persons services, including long term residential care. To this end, there has been significant learnings from the experience and impact of COVID-19 on nursing homes, and more generally, and these learnings are informing a wide-ranging programme of reform which was recommended in the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report. This report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in implementing the recommendations of the Expert Panel, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, and work to progress medium and longer term reform recommendations is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published to date, the latest published on 21 June 2022, and all are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Persons who hold a medical card or a GP visit card are not subject to any co-payments or other charges in respect of such services including GP consultations.</p>  <p>  There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services (blood tests) provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition. </p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme involves the ongoing monitoring of a patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  Where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p></reply>

I have met directly with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes, to discuss this issue, and have met with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. Nursing Homes Ireland has recently responded to a request for further information from the NTPF, this response is currently being considered. I have also visited a number of Nursing Homes in recent weeks to discuss this issue with management of both public and private/voluntary nursing units. It is imperative for me that the optimum level of care for the resident is maintained.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.</p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.053 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The Department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p><p>Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<ol type="1"><li>Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</li><li>Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</li><li>Agency roles working in the HSE;</li><li>Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</li><li>Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</li><li>Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</li></ol>The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p><p>I would also like to remind the Deputy that it is against Department policy to comment on individual cases.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition. </p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.</p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.</p><p>In October 2021, my Department asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p><p>I can confirm that the NIAC recently submitted its advices in relation to the HPV Vaccination Programme to my Department. As part of its advices, the NIAC noted that HPV vaccination should be prioritised for unvaccinated second level students and females under the age of 25 years.</p><p>In line with that advice, I have asked the HSE to provide an opportunity for all boys and girls in secondary schools who were previously eligible to receive the HPV vaccine and who have not yet, for whatever reason, received it, to now be offered the vaccine.</p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p></reply>

However, it is also home to marine-related industrial, tourism and leisure businesses. The multi-faceted business in a very confined space at Dunmore East presents difficult challenges for the operational team in doing their best to co-ordinate the flow of people and goods through the harbour and to keep all safe.  This is especially so in these summer months when the combination of users is at its most intense.</p>  <p>  In consideration of the increased activity in the harbour, my Department commissioned expert consultants to draw up a traffic management plan for the harbour. Everyone&rsquo;s overriding imperative must be safety, particularly with many young children coming and going for day trips and summer camps. The club identified by the Deputy was one of a number of stakeholders who were invited to meet with the consultants and feed their views into the plan.  The consultants took all requests on board to the greatest extent possible, having regard to the standards required for traffic control measures.</p>  <p>  The plan envisages a continuous flow model operating during the summer, providing set down areas for drop-and-go movements at peak times and thereby continuous access for all users. </p>  <p>  A dedicated car park was installed by my Department in 2018 to encourage parking away from the busiest parts of the harbour. My Department only owns a small footprint in Dunmore East and the constraints of physical space make it impossible to facilitate everyone&rsquo;s desire to park at the harbour.  The harbour management team continues to work with all users to make special provisions for any planned events to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

The package seeks to incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops through the Tillage Incentive Scheme and introduces supports to encourage farmers to grow protein crops in 2022. Supporting domestic production of tillage and protein crops is a key mechanism in reducing Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on imported feed materials.</p>  <p>  The Package also included a Multi-Species Sward Initiative and a Red Clover Silage Measure to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming, and thereby reduce nitrogen fertiliser usage, while maintaining forage yield.</p>  <p>  I have also recently launched a &euro;56 million Fodder Support Scheme. This Scheme aims to incentivise farmers, in particular drystock farmers, to grow more fodder (silage and/or hay) for the coming winter to ensure we do not have any animal welfare issue over the coming winter and next spring.

One strand of the consultation process included bilateral meetings with key stakeholders - 28 of these meetings have taken place over the last number of months. A public attitudes survey, a community engagement survey and a youth dialogue have already been completed. </p><p>An online public consultation  was launched on 16<sup>th</sup>March and closed on 27<sup>th </sup>April 2022, with over 3,000 responses received. These responses are currently being examined and will provide important feedback on a range of areas which will help shape the next Forest Strategy.</p><p>A Deliberative Dialogue of 100 people, representative of the general demographics of the population, took place on 10th and 14th May 2022. This event provided a platform for a diverse group of people to learn about the values associated with trees and forests, the challenges we face and to discuss and deliberate the future of Irish forests.</p><p>The new Forest Strategy will underpin a new Forestry Programme for the period 2023 - 2027. My Department is currently engaging further with stakeholders on the measures that will be considered for the new Programme. To date, four bilateral meetings have taken place with members of the Forestry Policy Group (FPG). Details of Programme development will be presented to all members of the FPG on Thursday 23<sup>rd</sup>June. SEEFA are not members of the FPG and bilateral meetings with associations who are not members of this Group are not planned.</p><p>The Forestry Programme 2023-2027 will be subject to a Strategic Environmental Assessment/Appropriate Assessment process, and this will include public consultation on the draft Programme and Environmental Report.</p></reply>

Interest in afforestation has been impacted by the complexity of the legal and administrative system, judicial decisions, the efficiency of the forestry licensing system, the appetite among landowners to convert land to afforestation usage and, in some areas, complex societal attitudes and responses to afforestation. Both myself and Minister Hackett are very conscious of the need to increase afforestation rates given the target of 8,000 hectares set out in the Climate Action Plan </p><p>We have focussed on addressing the licensing issue and  on looking to the future of trees and forests in Ireland under  the framework of Project Woodland.</p><p>The licensing situation is improving as a result of increased investment in resources and a continual improvement in processes. We issued 4,050 licences in 2021 and intend to increase this to 5,250 in 2022. We aim to more than double the number of afforestation licences to 1,040 by year end. Last year 502 afforestation licences issued for 4,246 hectares, but only 2016 hectares were planted. This low conversion rate is a challenge. There are currently 5,200 ha in the system, which have a valid approval, but have not gone ahead to planting. We have written to 451 applicants with unused licences to remind them that their licence is still valid and to encourage them to consider using them before their approval lapses. Of those, 28 have contacted us to confirm that they have  commenced planting or have  indicated that they intend to do so this year. </p><p>Communication and positive messaging about the benefits of afforestation is crucial. On most farms, planting can comfortably co-exist with livestock enterprises and can significantly increase the net income from the holding. We must work together to communicate this positive message consistently.</p></reply>

All payments have now been processed.</p>  <p>  On 23rd March, the EU Commission announced the adoption of exceptional adjustment aid to producers in agricultural sectors which have been impacted by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. The aid provided for was granted as a measure supporting agricultural markets following the transfer of funds from the reserve for crisis in the agricultural sector.  The exceptional aid allocation to Ireland was &euro;15.8 million in EU funding and there are detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this allocation; set out in Commission Delegated Regulation 2022/467 of 23rd March 2022. </p>  <p>  The Government approved my proposal to allocate &euro;2.8 million of this EU funding to support the Irish horticulture sector, with the remainder dedicated to supporting the pig sector.  On 13th June, I announced the opening of applications for the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme 2 (PEPS2).

The policy acknowledges the importance for island communities of access to reliable, safe and affordable connectivity services to and from the mainland. </p>  <p>  Contracts for connectivity services are procured by the Department of Rural and Community Development on the open market through the procurement process. This ensures that all providers are treated equally and that the selection process is fair and transparent for all.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport recently introduced a fare reduction scheme that sees an average of 20% reduction on PSO public transport services that are managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA).</p>  <p>  Therefore the scheme covers public transport services operated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Luas, Go-Ahead Ireland and TFI Local Link.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that other subsidised transport services managed by the Department of Transport, such as the PSO air service to Donegal and Kerry, are not covered by the scheme.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the subsidised transport services managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development to the off shore islands do not qualify for the scheme. </p>  <p>  Unlike the services managed by the NTA, offshore islands have a mix of subsidised and non-subsidised transport services.</p>  <p>  While my Department is, of course, open to examining ways of ensuring that island transport services are affordable, it is concerned that the introduction of a fare reduction scheme for subsidised services could bring the existing contracts and procurement processes into disrepute.</p>  <p>  All of the contracted air, ferry and cargo services managed by my Department are procured in an open and fair procedure. Providing a fare reduction scheme for chosen suppliers could have the potential to undermine those procedures and may also lead to reduced services to the islands, particularly with regard to non-subsidised services and other private operators who may be placed at a disadvantage.</p>  <p>   As the Deputy is aware, my Department has sought advice from the Attorney General in relation to the matter. Officials have been engaging in this regard since early March and there has been regular contact in order to progress the matter. I understand my Department has recently received a response from the Office of the Attorney General, which is currently being considered by my officials.</p></reply>
