The City Council has been examining a range of sites for their suitability to best capitalise on the &euro;3m investment including two buildings in DCC ownership to create up to  40 new Artists Workspaces. </p>  <p>  Recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres, many of which were initiated and funded by local authorities. These centres also benefit from capital schemes operated by my Department. Annual support provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. The Arts Council and County and City Management Association (CCMA) have a joint ten year agreement which  is strongly focused on continued investment. </p>  <p>  Capital schemes including the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 and the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 provides capital grants for arts and culture centres and are administered by my Department.  The schemes focus on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. These included allocations for projects involving artist's studios and creative spaces. </p>  <p>  My Department is also funding a major &euro;460 million programme of investment in our National Cultural Institutions under the National Development Plan.  These institutions are largely based in Dublin City.   </p>  <p>  County and city councils prepare and implement plans for the development of the arts within their functional areas in accordance with Section 6 of the Arts Act 2003 and Section 67 of the Planning and Development Act 2001.  County and city development plans are drawn up by local authorities in accordance with their functions under the Planning and Development Acts.  I understand that the new draft City Development Plan 2022 &ndash; 2028 for Dublin City Council proposes addressing the provision  of artists&rsquo; workspaces. </p>  <p>  The Department for Housing, Planning, and Local Government operate the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund to support a programme of significant transformational capital projects that will contribute to the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns.  I understand there is an allocation to Dublin City Council in respect of Artists Workspaces under this programme </p></reply>

Specifically, Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands will be promoted for approximately 12 weeks with a TV advertisement airing nationally and in Northern Ireland, as well as through dedicated radio, press, and social media, and the region will also feature across PR, digital and media partnerships throughout the summer. This represents an increase of eight weeks' airtime on the 2021 schedule when the Ireland's Hidden Heartlands advertisement ran over a four-week period.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland continues to promote Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands around the world &ndash; across a range of platforms including on Ireland.com and through social media; at major international consumer and trade fairs; through familiarisation visits for influential travel agents, tour operators, as well as international travel and lifestyle journalists, influencers and bloggers; and through Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s promotional material including market guides and brochures.</p>  <p>  As announced on 9th February by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, counties Cavan, Westmeath and Offaly will now sit wholly within the Ireland's Hidden Heartlands brand and will no longer be part of the Ireland's Ancient East brand.  Furthermore, a slightly greater portion of County Tipperary will also be encompassed within the Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands brand (namely all the Nenagh Municipal District and part of the Thurles Municipal District).  The expanded footprint for Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands will give visitors a more cohesive visitor experience in the area, strengthen the brand's tourism offering and will allow F&aacute;ilte Ireland to further raise awareness of the region domestically and internationally.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland launched a Destination Experience Development Plan for Lough Derg in April 2021 and intends to develop and launch four other Plans for the region, which will further enhance the appeal of destinations within the Ireland's Hidden Heartlands brand region.</p></reply>

My Department also has a dedicated email address to answer any questions that applicants may have about any aspect of the Scheme to assist artists and creative arts workers with queries about the Scheme. </p></reply>

These changes are for the most part driven by advances in technology and the manner in which we ourselves consume media content.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to putting in place a framework which will enable a sustainable future for a vibrant, diverse and independent media sector, encompassing print, audiovisual, radio and online.</p>  <p>  A key element in this was the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, which was chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith. I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the Commission's task was a complex one, with a remit to address the many issues of concern for the entire media industry. As a result, the Commission&rsquo;s report and the wide ranging recommendations it contains has required careful and detailed thought.</p>  <p>  However, the consideration of the Commission&rsquo;s report cannot be carried out in isolation, but must have regard to a range of other complex and inter-related issues that Government is addressing in the wider media and digital space. These include the national digital strategy and Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the implementation of the Digital Services Act, which has been recently agreed at political level in Europe.</p>  <p>  Another key element of this overall approach is the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which is currently at Committee stage in the Seanad, and in particular the establishment of a new media regulator, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n.</p>  <p>  An Coimisi&uacute;n will provide the regulatory and developmental framework to implement the report of the Future of Media Commission.  The Commission will comprise an Executive Chairperson and three additional Commissioners, including a Broadcasting Commissioner and a Media Development Commissioner. Both of these Commissioners will have a role in ensuring the effective delivery of the report.</p>  <p>  The detailed consideration of the Future of Media Commission&rsquo;s report by An Taoiseach, myself and other key Ministers is nearing conclusion, and it will be brought to Government for consideration in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The Strategy and supporting action plan have cross-departmental ownership and, accordingly, responsibility for implementation falls on a number of Government Departments, bodies and Irish language and Gaeltacht organisations. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is responsible inter alia, for coordinating its implementation.</p><p>The Action Plan and the two annual progress reports published to date present a clear overview of the 180 or so actions being advanced by circa 60 stakeholders in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions. Undoubtedly, functioning in the shadow of the pandemic over the last two years has proved challenging  and this is no less the case in terms of delivery of supports in the domain of Irish language and Gaeltacht affairs.</p><p>Nonetheless, significant progress is being made and the publication of the second progress report - covering the period from July 2019 to December 2020, following Government approval, sets out in detail the advances that have been made on a cross-governmental and cross-sectoral basis over the period.</p><p>In terms of financial supports for the language insofar as my Department is concerned, an additional exchequer allocation of &euro;7m for language programmes plus &euro;4.2m extra for Irish language broadcasting was included in Budget 2022, further enabling support for the language and Gaeltacht regions  - particularly in the context of the ongoing implementation of the language planning process and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, being spearheaded by the Department of Education. </p><p>This additional allocation ultimately means that total funding of nearly &euro;90m is being deployed by my Department in support of the Irish language and Gaeltacht regions in the current year. </p><p>An overview of measures, schemes and initiatives being undertaken in support of the language can be found on my Department's website as well as those of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge.</p></reply>

It is expected that a number of additional projects will be in a position to draw down funding this year. </p>  <p>  The total funding applied for under the scheme significantly exceeded the amount available to allocate and it was not possible to allocate grants to many worthy projects. It was also not possible to  provide all successful applicants the full amount sought.</p>  <p>  While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the projects that were allocated funding, as it is now two years since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department has now met with all successful grantees and work is at an advanced stage in drafting the review. I expect this work to be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  Once that review is complete the scope for awarding any additional grants, adjusting the level  of existing grants and the timing of any new call for proposals, including proposals for new swimming pools, will be considered. </p></reply>

A provisional grant of &euro;918,750 was announced in January 2020 towards the overall design cost and my Department made its first payment in respect of this grant towards the end of last year. </p>  <p>  Advancing the project to construction stage is a matter for Dublin City Council in the first instance.

This is evidenced by the Government&rsquo;s recent decision to support an expression of interest by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in bidding, with the UK, for the right to host the Euro 2028 football championships, and by the decision to support the hosting of the 2030 T20 Cricket World Cup, in association with England, Wales and Scotland as well as the upcoming hosting of the following events:</p><p>- US College Football classics every August from 2022 to 2026 </p><p>- The Europa League football final in 2024, and </p><p>- The Ryder Cup in 2027 in Limerick</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put in place a Strategy for attracting Major Sports Events to Ireland. </p><p>As part of my Department's work in this regard, a public consultation on hosting Major International Sports Events in Ireland is currently live and is accessible at www.gov.ie. The consultation seeks the public&rsquo;s views on how Ireland should approach such events into the future.

The closing date for submissions is the 26<sup>th</sup>of May and the outcome of the consultation will feed into the development of the policy around hosting Major International Sports Events. </p></reply>

Under this programme, &euro;2.25 million is provided annually to the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) with the broad aim of creating more opportunities for young boys and girls to participate in field sports. The field sport programme is based on an ethos of developing the grassroots of the game, growing participation numbers, embracing communities outside of the traditional base of the sport and improving coaching and playing standards. </p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;230,000 has been allocated to the IRFU for the two years 2021 and 2022 under the Women in Sport funding programme. The Women in Sport Programme aims to support National Governing Bodies (NGBs) and enhance all aspects of female involvement across the Women in Sport policy target areas namely, Coaching &amp;amp; Officiating, Active Participation, Leadership &amp;amp; Governance and Visibility.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland also allocates funding for the women&rsquo;s sevens game through its high performance funding programme. In 2021, Sport Ireland provided additional funding of &euro;120,000 to specifically support the appointment of key personnel to coach and lead the Women&rsquo;s Sevens Programme. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Minister Martin and I demonstrated our support for women&rsquo;s rugby through our recent engagement with the group of players who sought our support in relation to issues they had with the IRFU and particularly the reviews that the IRFU were conducting into the women&rsquo;s game. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland supported the players in their engagement with the IRFU and remained engaged with all parties up to the launch, in March 2022, of the independent review commissioned by the IRFU into the Women&rsquo;s Rugby World Cup qualification campaign. This included meetings with all of the parties present and sessions with the players.  Sport Ireland remains available to all parties should it be required.</p></reply>

Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s key audience is the &lsquo;Culturally Curious&rsquo; traveller. These are people who have a strong desire and high propensity to travel internationally and who are interested in our rich heritage and culture. </p>  <p>  Therefore, our living and historic culture sits at the heart of what is presented and communicated widely across Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s suite of global marketing communications. Tourism Ireland aims to ensure that visitors understand that they can easily marry opportunities to visit and appreciate our historic sites &ndash; pre-Christian, monastic, castles or stately homes &ndash; with active involvement in our vibrant living culture through festivals, music, literature, theatre and so on. A number of historic and iconic sites, including Trinity College and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, feature in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s global Green Button campaign in overseas markets.</p>  <p>  Festivals and events also play a significant part in attracting and holding visitors in particular areas of Ireland at different times of the year. Tourism Ireland works closely with many festivals to provide exposure for them in key markets overseas. The St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, Galway 2020, Cork Jazz Festival, and Wexford Festival Opera are just some examples of festivals which have received extensive coverage through Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing overseas.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland also work with Culture Ireland to bring the best of Ireland&rsquo;s artists, writers, poets, musicians and dancers to the attention of enthusiasts and new audiences. </p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland's work in the Cultural Space celebrates James Joyce's &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo; which was first published as a complete novel on 2 February 1922. One hundred years later, Tourism Ireland is taking every opportunity to highlight Ulysses100 and Dublin&rsquo;s literary credentials in its promotional activity around the world. Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s aim is to encourage potential visitors to come and follow in the footsteps of Leopold Bloom, to explore Dublin and discover some of the city&rsquo;s cultural and architectural delights.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland also launched an exciting new giant-screen documentary film called 'Ireland' across the United States in February 2022. Narrated by Liam Neeson, 'Ireland' celebrates our rich history, culture, arts and music, as well as our spectacular scenery. The release of 'Ireland' has played a significant part in the recovery of tourism from the United States this year. 'Ireland' has been seen by millions of people across the United States &ndash; helping to inspire them to put the island of Ireland on their holiday wish-list for 2022. </p>  <p>  Irish Culture also features prominently throughout F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s domestic marketing communications. Taking the past year as an example, the promotion of culture and heritage sites was ongoing in the &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo; multi-channel national campaign. All 26 counties featured and had dedicated campaign assets that showcased their cultural attractions and experiences. Some examples include Knowth, Co. Meath; Birr Castle, Co. Offaly; Kylemore Abbey, Co. Galway; National Heritage Park, Wexford; and Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's 'Winter in Dublin' campaign which ran into the new year was created to promote a specially curated programme of cultural events and experiences taking place in the capital throughout the Winter. Flagship events within the campaign - such as TradFest - promoted Irish musical talent at their core. </p></reply>

Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will also have functions relating to the promotion of an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment, including research, education, media literacy, the protection of children, and journalistic and creative supports.</p>  <p>  Given that infringement proceedings have been launched against Ireland for the delay in the transposition of the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which will be given effect in Irish law by the Bill, I am keen to see the Bill enacted by the Summer Recess. This would pave the way for formal establishment of An Coimisi&uacute;n by Ministerial commencement order in the second half of this year.</p>  <p>  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 was initiated in the Seanad on 25 January 2022 and underwent Second Stage on 22 February 2022. Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad commenced on 26 April 2022 and continued on  28 April and yesterday, 4 May. The next Committee stage session is scheduled for 10 May. </p>  <p>  Given the importance of An Coimisi&uacute;n, Government has approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. While An Coimisi&uacute;n will, as set out in the Bill, ultimately be funded through levies on regulated services I secured &euro;5.5 million in Budget 2022 to provide start-up funds to resource the establishment process.</p>  <p>  A programme of work is now underway to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise to establish and lead An Coimisi&uacute;n and to lay the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions. This includes managing the transition of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland staff and functions to An Coimisi&uacute;n, while at the same time ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulation set out under the Broadcasting Act 2009. </p>  <p>  The recruitment of the senior staff who will lead and manage An Coimisi&uacute;n is a priority. Work is currently underway between my officials and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service to secure the recruitment of those staff, including the Executive Chairperson and Online Safety Commissioner, through open, transparent and effective public competitions. In light of the international reach of An Coimisi&uacute;n's remit, the recruitment process will commence with an Executive Search by the Public Appointments Service, to raise the profile and awareness of these critical posts, followed by advertising  of the posts. </p></reply>

Plans for Castlebar and Dungarvan are currently being examined by my Department while the preparation of plans is being advanced in the case of Cahersiveen and Cork City. Preparatory work is also in hand in the case of Clifden, Co Galway.</p>  <p>  To date, 3 Irish Language Networks have been approved under the process - Ennis, Loughrea and Clondalkin - as well as two others in the north - Carn T&oacute;char and Iarthar Bh&eacute;al Feirste - which have been approved by Foras na Gaeilge under a non-statutory process being overseen by the organisation. </p>  <p>  21 Language Planning Officers (19 in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas and two in Gaeltacht Service Towns) and four Assistant Language Planning Officers are currently engaged in implementing approved plans. </p>  <p>  My Department has, through successive budgets, increased the allocation available for implementation of the language planning process.  The total allocation from budget 2022 for the process amounts to &euro;5.8m - an increase of &euro;800,000 on the 2021 allocation.  </p>  <p>  Approved language plans are provided with annual funding over a seven-year period of between &euro;80,000 and &euro;150,000, with one plan receiving &euro;300,000 on an exceptional basis primarily due to geographical challenges, namely: Oile&aacute;in &Aacute;rann. </p>  <p>  In further support of the process, my Department also provides current funding to support language-centred programmes in the domains of early years; family and the traditional arts by way of funding agreed work programmes with Comhar Nao&iacute;nra&iacute; na Gaeltachta; Tuismitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta and Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta respectively.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Department's Community and Language Supports Programme is also being deployed on an ongoing basis in overall support of the process.  </p>  <p>  My Department will shortly commence a periodic implementation review of approved plans. Under this arrangement, all plans approved under the process will be reviewed in year four of their implementation respectively. </p>  <p>  A broader overview of the advances being made in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions, including the language planning process, is set out in the second progress report on the ongoing implementation of the Government's 5-year Action Plan for the Irish Language which my Department published on behalf of Government in October 2021. </p></reply>

The role of the expert group is to examine whether it is practicable to do this and, if so, how it may be done.</p>  <p>  The group will be reporting to me in the first half of May with their recommendations. If an amendment to the Bill is required to give effect to any recommendations of the group, this will require further detailed consideration and I would of course need to consult with the Office of the Attorney General regarding how such an amendment could be structured and drafted. </p>  <p>  As I have said before, if an individual complaints mechanism can be provided for, then I&rsquo;d like to ensure that it is. In this regard, any proposals that I bring forward must be workable and legally robust.</p></reply>

It is anticipated 10 million may ultimately leave Ukraine, with more than 100,000 of these possibly arriving in Ireland. This will present the State with a challenge of unprecedented immediacy and magnitude, requiring an equally unprecedented and extraordinary emergency response to accommodate those already here and those yet to come.</p>  <p>  My Department is leading cross-government consideration of options to meet the longer-term accommodation requirements of Ukrainian refugees, including temporary emergency accommodation and measures to facilitate its delivery. Planning legislation provides for emergency situations of this nature and the provisions &ndash; used previously to respond to the Syrian refugee crisis and COVID pandemic &ndash; may allow buildings to be built or commercial and others converted to accommodation for Ukrainian refugees, on a temporary basis. Where development is required which is intended for longer-term use, separate emergency provisions may allow, on a case-by-case basis, for the use of Ministerial orders.</p>  <p>  Generally, emergency provisions are not appropriate for the delivery of domestic housing, which requires a more strategic, long-term approach as provided for in Housing for All. That said, where suitable accommodation is developed as part of the humanitarian response, it may be turned to social and affordable housing when the humanitarian crisis is resolved. </p></reply>

This is clearly in keeping with RPZ designation criteria and is not a loophole in the process. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provides that any area falling within the new Cork City Council boundary, which was not already within a RPZ, became an RPZ from 31 May 2019. </p>  <p>  At the moment, while rental inflation in the Carrigaline LEA has been above the Non-GDA Standardised Average Rent of &euro;1,058.95, the LEA has only been above 7% in 2 of the last 6 quarters, thereby not satisfying the criteria for designation as an RPZ at this time.  The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor this carefully and if the Carraigaline LEA meets the designation criteria it will be designated as an RPZ.  </p></reply>

Where the household is deemed qualified for support, it is placed on the housing authority&rsquo;s waiting list and offers of suitable accommodation are made in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme as they arise.</p>  <p>  The allocation scheme is made by the elected members under section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and in compliance with Social Housing Allocation Regulations made thereunder, and specifies, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households on the housing and transfer lists. Under section 22, an allocation scheme shall apply to dwellings owned or under the control of a local authority, as well as dwellings provided by an AHB with Exchequer funding.</p>  <p>  Where a vacancy arises in a dwelling owned by an AHB, the relevant local authority may nominate suitable households from its housing or transfer list to that body, having regard to the order of priority set out in its allocation scheme.  </p>  <p>  If an AHB is in receipt of funding under a relevant Exchequer funding scheme, they must comply with the terms and conditions of that scheme. Under such funding schemes (made available through local authorities), the AHB is required to make the property available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the governing board of an individual AHB to determine how property, which is solely owned by the AHB without any mortgage or debt funding in place, is allocated to tenants in accordance with their constitution. All AHB tenancies are registered with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and therefore this channel should be the primary recourse in terms of procedures in any tenant/landlord matters.</p>  <p>  As provided for in the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Act 2019, the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority (AHBRA) was formally established on 1 February 2021. One of the objectives of AHBRA is to provide further assurances to investors, tenants, the Government and to the sector itself that social housing providers operate in a well-regulated and stable environment.</p>  <p>  The Regulator can cancel the registration of an AHB on a number of different grounds. If the Regulator considers it necessary for the protection of tenants of dwellings, the Regulator will, by notice and with consent, require an AHB to transfer such dwellings to another AHB identified by the Regulator or to a Housing Authority if the Regulator considers it appropriate. The Regulator can also seek a High Court Order if it is necessary for the purpose of the protection of the tenants of dwellings provided or managed by an AHB.</p></reply>

The funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. </p>  <p>  From 2014 to 2021, expenditure of some &euro;261 million was recouped to local authorities under the Voids Programme which funded the return to productive use of 18,527 properties nationwide. Local authorities also provide significant funding from their own resources to address the level of vacancy within the social housing stock.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in this area. Funding allocations under the 2022 Programme will be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  Given the very significant investment into the Voids Programme over recent years, particularly in 2020 and in 2021, local authorities should now be in a strong position to begin the transition to a strategic and informed planned maintenance approach to stock management and maintenance. To that end, my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance, to a planned maintenance approach as referenced in Housing for All, policy objective 20.6. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes is aligned with this approach.</p></reply>

This is a national template for arrangements in each area to enable all involved at a local level to work together to support the integration of Ukrainian refugees to our communities. </p>  <p>  The Community Response Forums are meeting regularly and are doing so in a very positive and collaborative environment.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the growing numbers involved and the complexity of managing such a quickly changing situation, on 22nd April, I wrote again to Chief Executives of all local authorities to request that a Director of Service level staff member be assigned full time, supported by a small team, to coordinate the provision of services and supports locally.  My Department is engaging with local authorities to ensure that the necessary resources are in place to facilitate this strengthening of the local coordination effort.</p></reply>

The designation of all existing RPZs has also been extended until 31 December 2024. The Act provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time.</p>  <p>  The Act also introduced measures to better protect tenants with affordability by prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).</p>  <p>  To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for March 2022 shows HICP inflation of 6.9% p.a.), the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs, where the inflation rate is higher. In effect, this will mean that rents in RPZs may only increase by a maximum of 2% per annum pro rata during times of higher inflation. </p>  <p>  In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords, legislating for the lowering of existing rents is considered legally questionable and highly vulnerable to legal challenge. The Housing Agency continually monitors the rental market and may recommend further areas with the highest and fastest growing rent to be designated as RPZs.  </p>  <p>  The solution to dealing with the rental market challenges is to provide for increased supply of homes. Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland does that through a range of interventions and unprecedented investment with in excess of &euro;20 billion in funding over the next five years.</p></reply>

Overall targets to 2030 include 54,000 affordable housing units, 36,000 of which will be affordable purchase homes with the remaining 18,000 as cost rental units.  From 2022 to 2026, it is anticipated that over 28,000 affordable homes will be delivered.</p>  <p>  Affordable housing delivery targets have been allocated to local authority areas where prices are highest and it has been identified that the need for affordable housing is a sufficiently significant proportion of overall housing need.  The five year target, from 2022 to 2026 for local authority affordable delivery is 7,550 (this projected figure excludes those affordable dwellings expected to be delivered under the terms of Part V agreements).  Local authorities are progressing delivering affordable housing in 2022 and on planning and building a pipeline of affordable housing projects into the future.</p>  <p>  In addition to this local authority delivery, affordable purchase and cost rental homes will also be made available by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and the Land Development Agency (LDA) in these local authority areas as part of the overall affordable housing delivery commitment under Housing For All.  Targets for affordable delivery by AHBs and the LDA were set nationally in consultation with AHB sector representatives and the LDA, having regard to projected delivery capacity.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders and I can confirm that all parties are working with a view to deploying the scheme by the end of June this year.  It will improve access to newly-built homes, below the median price point, by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes.  This measure, targeted at first time or fresh start buyers, will allow purchasers to exit the rental market, help to build developer confidence in realisable consumer demand, and contribute to the recovery of our construction sector following the Covid-19 emergency.   This Scheme will be available nationwide.</p>  <p>  Other measures to allow buyers to affordably access newly-constructed housing such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan (formerly the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan), are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.  Information on these schemes is available at the following links:</p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx, and</p>  <p>  localauthorityhomeloan.ie/</p></reply>

These measures deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable purchase homes on Local Authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to Cost Rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of affordable housing targets. Specifically, 54,000 affordable homes will be delivered between now and 2030 by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Land Development Agency (LDA) and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p>  <p>  I signed two  sets of Regulations which underpin the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, made under the provisions of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, which came into effect on 13 April 2022.   </p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Regulations 2022 made with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, deal with the assessment of income/means as part of eligibility for an Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangement. The text of these Regulations is available online at:   </p>  <p>  www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/183/made/en/print   </p>  <p>   The Affordable Housing (No. 2) Regulations 2022 prescribe, among other things, the notification of affordable dwelling schemes to the public, the use by Local Authorities of schemes of priority, the calculation of home purchase prices and the equity shares to be taken by the Local Authority, and the minimum payment for a homeowner redeeming the Local Authority's equity interest. The text of these Regulations is available online at:   </p>  <p>  www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/184/made/en/print   </p>  <p>  In relation to Cost Rental, to date I have made three sets of regulations that expand on the policy framework for this new sector as set out in Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act. On 19 August 2021 I made the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Designation) Regulations 2021, which came into effect that day. These Regulations govern the process by which the owners of dwellings may obtain the designation of their properties as Cost Rental dwellings. The text of these Regulations is available online at:   </p>  <p>  http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/425/made/en/print    </p>  <p>  On 23 December 2021, I made two further sets of regulations concerning Cost Rental, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Letting and Eligibility) Regulations 2021 and the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Rent Setting) Regulations 2021, which both came into effect on 1 January 2022. The text of these Regulations is available online at:</p>  <p>  www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/755/made/en/print    </p>  <p>  www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/756/made/en/print </p>  <p>  The Cost Rental Letting and Eligibility Regulations prescribe how landlords of cost rental dwellings should advertise vacancies in such properties and how interested parties can express an interest in leasing these homes. The Regulations also set out the main eligibility condition for leasing a cost rental dwelling, which is that a household&rsquo;s annual income, less income tax, PRSI, USC and superannuation contributions, must not be greater than &euro;53,000. In cases where the number of applicants exceed the number of available homes, an independently-verifiable lottery will be utilised to select applicants. Landlords should ensure that each property is suitably sized to meet a household&rsquo;s needs based on the number of occupants and that the tenants selected in the lottery meet the income eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  The Cost Rental Rent Setting Regulations prescribe additional detail and relevant formulae in order to set out how rent reviews under Cost Rental work in practice. Rents can be reviewed annually in line with the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), with formulae set out for how reviews should be undertaken in three specific circumstances: the first rent in any tenancy, the first review of this rent and all subsequent reviews of this rent. All rents calculated are maximum rents, meaning landlords are free to charge the tenant less than this should they so wish.</p>  <p>  Under the Government's Housing for All strategy, 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026 by AHBs, Local Authorities and the LDA. AHBs will be supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding and Local Authorities will be able to avail of funding for Cost Rental delivery through the Affordable Housing Fund. The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh. </p>  <p>  The first 65 CREL-funded Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021 at least 40% below comparable open-market prices and range of other Cost Rental developments have been made available and tenanted in the period since then.</p>  <p>   The First Home scheme will employ an equity stake model to support the purchase of c. 8,000 new homes on the private market in the years 2022 to 2025. The scheme will be jointly established and governed with participating mortgage lenders (primarily pillar retail banks). The overall anticipated spending for the scheme is &euro;400m, funded on a 50:50 basis by the State and participating mortgage lenders. The current schedule anticipates a launch of the First Home scheme website at the start of June, with a full scheme deployment and acceptance of applications from the end of June.</p>  <p>  Project Tosaigh was also announced through the Housing for All strategy. Under this initiative, additional funding of &euro;1bn was committed to the LDA, who will enter into forward purchase arrangements to kick-start stalled private developments and increase the supply of affordable housing. The LDA initiated a call on 12 November 2021 targeting a scale in excess of 150 affordable units per development and is currently in the process of finalising agreements with prospective proposers for the initial tranche of affordable homes delivered through this initiative.</p></reply>

However, where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possess those skills.  This policy fulfils our obligations under the Community Preference principles of membership of the EU. Under the Employment Permit Acts in order to work in the State all non-EEA nationals require a valid employment permit or relevant immigration permission from the Minister for Justice which allows them to reside and work in the State without the requirement for an Employment Permit.  </p>  <p>  Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the medium term, but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce.  In order to meet this demand, the Government is committed to building and retaining a highly skilled workforce to serve the needs of the economy and has introduced a series of initiatives focused on workforce upskilling of new workforce entrants and those made redundant by the pandemic.</p>  <p>  All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended and are dependent on a job offer from an Irish registered Employer for an eligible occupation.  It should be noted that the State's employment permit system is ordered by the use of occupation lists which determine which employments are highly demanded and which are ineligible for consideration for employment permits at a point in time.  These lists are reviewed on a twice-yearly basis.</p>  <p>  To assist applicants when applying for an employment permit checklist documents have been prepared.  Notably, checklist documents have been specifically prepare to assistant applicants when applying for a General Employment Permit for the roles of Chef and Hospitality Manager and these, inter alia, are available on the Department's website through the following link - Employment Permits Checklists - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie).</p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in applications for employment permits over the course of 2021 and into 2022 which has impacted on processing times.  From the start of January 2021 to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  </p>  <p>  The increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits following the Review of the Occupational Lists in October 2021.  Processing times were also impacted as a result of the HSE cyber-attack which had a direct effect on employment permit applications associated with the July 2021 Doctors rotation, which had to be processed manually. </p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment recognises the impact delays in the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and significant resources have been allocated to processing times. The Department is very conscious of the current timeframes for processing General Employment Permit applications and the staff of the Employment Permits Unit are committed to reducing these. </p>  <p>  An internal plan of action has been implemented which has increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications in the permits system.  The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels. </p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has reduced the number of applications awaiting processing from c. 11,000 in January 2022 to c. 6,900 to date.  As new staff were trained on Critical Skills Employment Permits, waiting times for those permits has fallen from 21 weeks for a Standard applicant to 6 weeks today.</p>  <p>  The Employment Permits Unit is currently processing Horticultural and Meat Sector General Employment Permits applications which were submitted in early December 2021, in addition to all other permits submitted then.  Given the large volume of applications from the Agriculture sector (c.1,000 horticulture applications and c.2,000 meat applications) we anticipate that it will take a further 1-2 weeks to fully process all these applications, in addition to normal processing workload.  The Department expects to see a consistent strong fall in waiting times for General Employment Permits from mid-May, with processing times considerably reduced by end Q2.</p>  <p>  As a result of incomplete or incorrect information being submitted at the time of application, the Employment Permits Unit may contact the applicant seeking additional information in support of the application in order to have all of the available information prior to making a decision.  In cases where an application has been rejected, a full detailed account of the reasons are detailed in the letter of refusal, as well as information in relation to seeking a formal review of any such decision.  A request for a review of the refusal decision must be submitted within 28 days from date of issue of the refusal notification.</p>  <p>  Information is provided on the Department&rsquo;s website in relation to employment permits including information in relation to each permit type, latest updates and an FAQ document which answers the majority of the most common questions, all of which are available through this link - enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/</p>  <p>Online employment permit applications may be submitted at epos.djei.ie.  A user guide to assist with online applications is available at the following link epos.djei.ie/EPOSOnlinePortal/UserGuide.pdf  </p></reply>

The SSRH provides an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems and an installation grant for renewable heating systems using heat pumps</p>  <p>  Any support for biomethane production or use must take due account of the level that can be produced from indigenous sustainable feedstocks, as set out in the National Heat Study. </p>  <p>  I also expect to be in a position to seek a Government decision in the near future in relation to the introduction of a Renewable Heat Obligation Scheme. It would be expected that any Renewable Heat Obligation would place an obligation on the suppliers of fuel that is to be used for heating to ensure a certain proportion of that fuel is renewable.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the steps being taken by my Department, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine oversees, through the National Development Plan (NDP), a capital fund of &euro;24 million to support the development of a pilot of agri-led Anaerobic Digestion plants. These Anaerobic Digestion plants will provide a market opportunity for farmers to participate as operators and/or feedstock providers. All sustainability criteria under RED II (recast Renewable Energy Directive) must be met and the scale up of production of renewable energy must not undermine food production.</p>  <p>In addition, the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine (DAFM) has a key role in the regulation of AD plants in Ireland when using animal by-products as feedstocks. Through this regulatory role DAFM continuously engages with stakeholders, including farmers, involved in anaerobic digestion both as operators and suppliers of feedstocks. The development of an AD industry provides farmers with both an income diversification opportunity as well as a land use alternative. To enhance understanding of the sector and how farmers and landowners may contribute, DAFM has funded a number of relevant research projects in this area. Of particular importance are two projects which have received part-funding from DAFM through the European Innovation Partnerships initiative (EIP), as part of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Bio-refinery Glas (small scale farmer-led green bio-refineries) and Irish Bio-energy Association (IrBEA) (small biogas demonstration programme) have both been awarded funding of over &euro;900,000 each and upon completion will provide valuable information of specific relevance to Irish farmers.  </p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999.The National Smart Metering Programme is overseen by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and ESB Networks is delivering the electricity smart meter rollout. To date over 750,000 smart meters have been installed and 1.1 million are due to be installed by the end of this year. The National Smart Metering Programme will roll out and install 2.3 million meters by 2025.</p><p>In February 2021, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) made it an obligation on electricity suppliers to provide Time of Use tariffs to their customers. Response 22 of the recently published National Energy Security Framework identifies the need to drive customer demand for these smart tariffs. Therefore, building on the existing supplier obligation, work is underway to put in place a smart meter data access code (due Quarter 4 2022), which will allow consumers to access much more detailed data on their historical energy usage, empowering them to engage with suppliers to find the smart tariff offering most suitable for them. This will in turn drive consumer demand for an increased range of more sophisticated smart tariff offerings from suppliers.</p><p>The National Energy Security Framework response also tasks the CRU with examining the charges within its remit to ensure that the differential between peak and off-peak tariffs provides the opportunity for electricity customers to save money by moving some consumption to off-peak times.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on general energy regulatory matters to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

I intend to take Question Nos 111 and 115 together.At EU level, Ireland participates in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). The EU ETS has established a carbon market, based on a cap-and-trade principle for carbon dioxide across a number of sectors such as electricity and heat generation, energy-intensive industries, as well as commercial aviation within the European Economic Area. </p><p>Annually, individual companies regulated by the EU ETS must acquire sufficient European Union Allowances (EAU) equal to their emissions. Some companies may receive a free allocation of EAUs, but most will buy EAUs from the market and through EU EAU auctions. If these companies do not comply with the regulation, heavy penalties are imposed. Sectors not included in the EU ETS, are covered by national policies under the EU&rsquo;s Effort Sharing legislation.</p><p>In relation to agriculture, the European Commission recently adopted a Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles setting out how to increase removals of carbon from the atmosphere. The Communication details actions to support carbon farming and upscale this green business model to better reward land managers for carbon sequestration and biodiversity protection. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 includes a commitment for the Government to develop an enabling framework to facilitate the development of a carbon farming initiative in Ireland.

These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. To enable Member States to comply with their annual emissions targets, the legislative framework of the ESD provides for a number of compliance options, including banking excess allowances from earlier years, purchasing international carbon credits, and trading excess allowances between Member States.Generally, compliance is calculated 18 months after the year in question (e.g. compliance for 2020 will take place in late 2022). To date Ireland has complied with its obligations under the ESD through direct emissions reductions and availing of the options to bank allowances from earlier years and to purchase international carbon credits. </p><p>The latest estimates of greenhouse gas emissions, published in October 2021 by the Environmental Protection Agency, indicate that for 2020, the projected shortfall to Ireland&rsquo;s target is 6.7 MtCO2eq.</p><p>As Ireland currently holds 2.9 million international credits, of which 1.4 million were purchased in 2021, the State will need to purchase an additional 3.8 million credits (from the international market) or allowances (from other Member States) to comply with the ESD target for 2020. As the designated purchasing agent on behalf of the State, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) administers and manages purchases of carbon credits. Details of all transactions entered into by the NTMA are published annually in a Carbon Fund Report at in accordance with section 6 of the Carbon Fund Act 2007.  </p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU is accountable to the Oireachtas and not to me as Minister.As part of its statutory role, the CRU also has consumer protection functions and monitors energy retail markets to ensure that competition continues to develop for the benefit of the consumer. It also oversees non-price aspects of competition and has taken, and continues to take, steps to increase transparency and consumer engagement in retail markets.

However, countries which have withdrawn from the ECT, remain bound under the so-called sunset provision, which applies to the pre-existing qualifying investments for 20 years from withdrawal. In 2017, the Energy Charter Conference decided to modernise the treaty in order to respond to the demands of member countries that find it obsolete with regard to current investment agreements. EU Member State governments and the European Commission are negotiating an update to the ECT&rsquo;s terms, but the talks have been slow and complex amid difficulties finding common agreement among the charter&rsquo;s members.</p><p>In September 2021, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU ) held that EU climate polluters could not use the arbitration system under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) to claim compensation in disputes between Member States.

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax, registration and insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore, they are illegal to use on public roads and in public places. However, they may be used on private land, with the permission of the landowner. </p>  <p>  Legislation for the use of e-scooters, in accordance with the Programme for Government and so that they may be used on our roads within a clear legal framework, is being progressed through the Road Traffic and Roads Bill. The Bill has completed second stage in the D&aacute;il and it is expected that it will go to committee stage shortly.</p>  <p>  To allow for the rapid pace of technological change in this area, specific controls on the use of e-scooters will be set out in regulations, following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief an individual must show that he or she has incurred "health expenses" for the provision of "health care". For the purposes of section 469 "health care" is the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability. Health expenses include the cost of treatment necessarily incurred in connection with the services of a medical practitioner. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that tax relief may be claimed on the cost of qualifying health expenses, and these can be in respect of personal health expenses, those of a family member or any individual&rsquo;s, as long as you paid for the medical expenses and provided you have paid tax in the relevant year.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the taxpayer in question was below the entry point to tax and therefore did not have an income tax liability for the tax periods 2018 to 2021 inclusive.  Based on the information currently available to Revenue, this is also likely to be the position for 2022. Accordingly, as the individual concerned has not paid tax, they are not able to claim a tax refund on any recent health expenses they may have incurred for the above-mentioned periods. </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that tax relief in respect of health expenses or any other applicable tax credit or relief may only be claimed where the person making the claim has paid tax in the relevant period.</p></reply>

This rate now continues to apply under the new VAT rates in place since 6 April. The 9% reduced VAT rate applies to the supply of newspapers and periodicals including brochures, leaflets and similar printed matter.   Other printed matter is liable to VAT at the Standard rate of 23%.  </p>  <p>  Goods which are imported from outside the EU are subject to VAT upon importation into the State.  The rate of VAT which applies to imports is the rate that would apply to the same goods within the State.  </p>  <p>  Further information on VAT and printed matter can be found on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

That includes women in leadership positions such as board members of National Governing Bodies (NGBs).</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the significant efforts that sporting bodies are now making around gender diversity on their boards. It is evident, however, that more work needs to be done. In the new Action Plan for Sport 2021-2023 all NGBs are being asked to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023.  It is a particular priority for me and Minister Martin to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation.</p>  <p>  The most recent Board Composition Snapshot which was published by Sport Ireland in December 2021, shows that the overall percentage of women on boards of NGBs has increased from 24% in 2019 to 32% in 2021. The Snapshot also highlights that 39 NGBs have now achieved 30% or more women on their board, up from 19 NGBs in 2019.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland will continue to provide support to NGBs towards achieving the target of 40% and will monitor and report on progress.</p></reply>

It is intended to build on this for this year&rsquo;s Culture Night.   In addition to this my Department is engaging with the National Cultural Institutions on developing plans for both individual pilot late night events and for later openings this year.</p>  <p>  The Report highlighted a number of challenges relating to planning and regulation for those operating in the Night-Time Economy.  To address these challenges a Night Time Economy Activation Workshop will take place next week, led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with support from my Department.   The outcome of the Workshop will be the development of best practice guidance to help Local Authorities (LAs) plan effectively for the Night-Time Economy.</p>  <p>  Following on from a successful roll-out of vulnerability training last December which supports the recommendation on the issue of public safety, my Department supported a series of additional sessions in March and April, which saw over 380 venues across all sectors of the Night Time Economy registering their staff for vulnerability training.  This training has been developed with and is supported by the nightclub sector (Give Us The Night), the Vintners Associations, Restaurant Association of Ireland, the local authorities and also with the support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice.</p>  <p>  My Department is also finalising a new funding scheme for venues, which when rolled out should increase footfall in our cities and towns in the evening and night-time and also open more opportunities for local artists and performers by providing them with paying gigs and ready-made venues.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made with our partners in the local authority to develop the pilot initiative establishing new "Night-Time Advisors" in six cities and towns to develop new Night-Time Economy opportunities.   </p>  <p>  My Department is also supportive of the Department of Justice&rsquo;s plans for legislative reform in the licensing area, which was also recommended by the NTE Taskforce and I understand that work is well advanced on this.  </p>  <p>  In support of action 5, my Department is working with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to carry out a consultation process in June with the 16-24 age group to determine what actions are required to support Night-Time Economy initiatives for different age-groups.  The next scheduled phase of consultation/workshops will be an older demographic and my Department will work with the appropriate agencies to determine the best models of engagement for this age demographic.</p>  <p>  I look forward to continued progress across all areas of this Report over the coming months.</p></reply>

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. It is the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p>  <p>  The local authority mortgage protection insurance (MPI) scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986, including the Local Authority Home Loan.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the MPI scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join, and remain in, the scheme. A local authority housing loan applicant, who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme, must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there are a number of differences between the local authority MPI scheme and standard MPI products available on the market.  Most notably, the current local authority MPI covers mortgage repayments in case of borrower disability, which is not part of standard MPI. In addition, the local authority MPI scheme offers a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme as opposed to standard MPI products that are individually priced based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors. </p>  <p>  In summary, the local authority scheme provides benefits not typically available under standard MPI products;</p>  <p>  - Mortgage repayments are paid if there is a valid claim as a result of disability;</p>  <p>  - Separate to life cover, an additional &euro;3,000 is payable in the event of a member&rsquo;s death</p>  <p>  - Members are covered for death up to age 75, where as standard MPI cover usually ceases at the age of 65.</p>  <p>  The scheme is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering in accordance with the terms of EU Directives relating to the award of public service contracts. This is to ensure that the most appropriate cover at the best value for money is secured for local authority borrowers over the entire life of their mortgages.</p>  <p>  The most recent public procurement competition for the provision and administration of this MPI scheme was conducted by the Local Government Management Agency. The contract resulting from this open tender competition came into effect from 1 January 2022 and is due to expire on 31 December 2022. My Department will review the provision and administration of the MPI scheme prior to that date.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-05-05a.361.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050500073#WRG03900"><p>The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme was introduced in 2012 for borrowers of commercial lending institutions and is targeted at those households in mortgage arrears who have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable by their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), who agree to the voluntary surrender of their home and who have very limited options, if any, to meet their long-term housing needs themselves. In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support. The concept of the scheme is that a household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to being a social housing tenant.  </p>  <p>  Under the MTR scheme, the borrower surrenders their property to their lender and it will be then sold to the MTR provider who is interested in the property. This can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd. If more than one party is interested in buying the property, the lender will provide information to the borrower around the options available to them and the borrower will make the decision on who purchases the property. The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.  </p>  <p>  In the initial years of the scheme, the scheme relied solely on AHBs to purchase from lenders, properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by borrowers. A Review of the MTR scheme for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions was published in February 2017. While there are obvious social and economic benefits to be derived from the MTR scheme, most significantly by facilitating individual households in mortgage arrears to remain in their home, the 2017 Review acknowledged that consideration needed to be given to the capacity of AHBs to intensify their involvement in the MTR scheme given the ambitious targets for the AHB sector around delivering new social housing supply. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Review committed to exploring the potential of private institutional investment in MTR in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale. The capital outlay to purchase these properties could be provided through private finance to avoid competing for upfront exchequer capital resources within the overall funding available for social housing. An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) acted as financial advisor during the process, undertaking due diligence on the financial capacity of the proposers to commit to the long-term undertaking of the scheme. The outcome from the EOI process was that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.  </p>  <p>  The inclusion of a private entity, in addition to the existing AHBs who continue to be an integral part of the MTR scheme, gives opportunities to achieve greater scale and meet the long-term housing needs of a greater number of borrowers who have unsustainable mortgage arrears. This is evident through the increased number of completed cases since the private entity has entered into the scheme. In 2021, approximately 250% more cases were completed as part of the scheme than in 2019. </p>  <p>  Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme. In all scenarios, my Department and the Housing Agency are focused on meeting the long-term housing needs of the greatest number of households in unsustainable mortgage arrears.  </p></reply>

These measures deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable purchase homes on Local Authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to Cost Rental as well as social and affordable housing. </p>  <p>  This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of affordable housing targets. At a national level, 54,000 affordable homes will be delivered between now and 2030 by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p>  <p>  Delivery of affordable housing, in accordance with the schemes set out in the Act and the funding being made available, will be underpinned by local authorities' Housing Delivery Action Plans. Local authorities, including South Dublin County Council, submitted their Plans to me in December 2021. Preparation of the Plans allowed each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly. The Plans are being revised and updated by local authorities in the light of ongoing engagement and clarifications, and I expect that they will be ready for publication by local authorities by the by the end of Q2. They will provide a comprehensive overview of projected delivery of affordable housing in South Dublin, and nationally. </p>  <p>  My Department understands that South Dublin County Council has notified successful applicants in relation to 16 Affordable Purchase homes under Advance Purchase arrangements at Kilcarbery Grange, Clondalkin.  Three Affordable Purchase schemes are currently in planning stages; Rathcoole, Killinarden and Clonburris, with construction expected to commence later this year. </p>  <p>  44 CREL-funded Cost Rental tenancies are expected at Parklands, Citywest in the near future, where tenants have already been selected by the Approved Housing Body Tuath. These units are expected to be delivered in Q2. The Cost Rental units are part of a mixed tenure development, which will comprise of 1,010 homes on completion. The Cost Rental units will consist of two-bedroom apartments and two-bedroom duplexes, with rents set at &euro;1,264 and &euro;1,297 respectively. </p>  <p>  Tenants have also been selected by Tuath for the 74 Cost Rental homes due to be completed at Kilcarbery Grange in Q2 2022. Cost Rents will be set at &euro;1,025 for the one-bedroom apartments and &euro;1,229 for the two-bedroom apartments. </p>  <p>  As affordable housing programmes are rolled out, additional affordable housing delivery will be facilitated through the expanded 20% Part V requirement, the introduction of the 'First Home' shared equity scheme, and the LDA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Project Tosaigh&rsquo;. </p></reply>

Section 4(1)(i) of the 2000 Act provides that development consisting of the thinning, felling or replanting of trees, forests or woodlands or works ancillary to that development, but not including the replacement of broadleaf high forest by conifer species, is exempted development for the purposes of the 2000 Act. </p>  <p>  An exemption at section 4 of the 2000 Act for thinning, felling or replanting of trees but specifically excluding the replacement of broadleaf high forest by conifer species from the scope of the exemption has been in place since the 2000 Act was enacted. However, since 21 September 2011, section 4(4) of the 2000 Act provides that development shall not be exempted development if an environmental impact assessment (EIA) or an appropriate assessment (AA) of the development is required. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this restriction on exempted development, section 4(4A) of the 2000 Act allows the Minister to make regulations prescribing development or any class of development that is authorised, or required to be authorised under another statute, and as respects which an EIA or an AA is required, to be exempted development.  </p>  <p>  In exercise of this power under section 4(4A) of the 2000 Act, article 8F of the 2001 Regulations (mirroring the exemption at section 4(1)(i) of the 2000 Act) retains the exemption for development (other than the replacement of broadleaf high forest by conifer species) that is licensed or approved under section 6 of the Forestry Act 2014 (No. 31 of 2014) and that consists of the thinning, felling or replanting of trees, forests or woodlands, or works ancillary thereto even where EIA and/or AA is required, on the basis that such environmental impact assessment will be carried out pursuant to the licencing processes under the Forestry Act 2014.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the amendment to article 8F of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, provided for in S.I. 45 of 2020 was to include a specific reference to licensing/approval provisions under section 6 of the Forestry Act 2014 (No. 31 of 2014).  </p>  <p>  Section 4(2) of the 2000 Act allows the Minister to exempt any class of development in certain circumstances by way of regulations.  In this context, Article 6 of, and Schedule 2 to, the 2001 Regulations set out classes of development which are exempt from planning permission requirements and includes at Class 16, Part 3 of Schedule 2 &ldquo;Replacement of broadleaf high forest by conifer species&rdquo;, where the area involved is less than 10 hectares. This exemption was not affected by amendments made under S.I. 45 of 2020. </p>  <p>  The Class 16 exemption is subject to general restrictions under Article 9 of the 2001 Regulations. Furthermore, Class 16 development loses its exempted development status and requires planning permission if an EIA or an appropriate assessment is required in accordance with Section 4(4) of the 2000 Act.  </p>  <p>  With regard to EIA requirements, Article 93 and Schedule 5, Part 2 of the 2001 Regulations provide that replacement of broadleaf high forest by conifer species, where the area involved would be greater than 10 hectares must be subject to EIA, while development below that threshold may require EIA if it is considered that it would be likely to have significant effects on the environment.  Any replacement of broadleaf high forest by conifer species which would be likely to have significant effects on a European Site (a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) or a Special Protected Area (SPA), or candidate area, designated under the Habitats Directive) requires an Appropriate Assessment and therefore planning permission.</p>  <p>  Requirements for the granting of a licence under the Forestry Regulations is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

These include a commitment to to examine defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report &quot;Safe as Houses?&quot; and to assist owners of latent defect properties, by identifying options for those impacted by defects, to access lowcost, long-term finance.  Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates these commitments. </p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected,</p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>1. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>2. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action. In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>3. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>1. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>2. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>3. Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>As part of its deliberations, the working group is consulting with a wide range of relevant stakeholders.  As part of this stakeholder engagement, the Working Group conducted a series of online surveys between 31 January and 14 March 2022 seeking the experiences of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents. These submissions are currently being analysed.  </p><p>The insights gained through engagement with stakeholders as well as the outcome of the online consultation are informing the ongoing deliberations of the Working Group and are supporting the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and finalisation of its report. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Working Group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter, and will require sufficient time to complete its work. In that context, I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents. </p></reply>

Due to the quasi-judicial role of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment on, or to interfere in, the specifics of any case.</p><p>Section 12(1)(b) of the Acts states that a landlord shall carry out necessary repairs and ensure that the structure of the dwelling complies with any standards prescribed. The Acts also provide that a landlord should allow a tenant of a rented dwelling to enjoy peaceful and exclusive occupation. A landlord is only allowed to enter the property with the tenant&rsquo;s permission or in an emergency.</p><p>Section 14 of the Act provides that a landlord of a dwelling shall not penalise a tenant for referring any dispute between the tenant and the landlord to the RTB for resolution or for giving evidence in any proceedings under Part 6 of the Act (Dispute Resolution).</p><p>The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019 specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas, oil and electrical supplies. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority. </p><p>Under sections 18A and 18B of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, a housing authority may issue an improvement notice or prohibition notice, respectively, where a property is found to be non-compliant. Under section 34 of that Act, any person who by act or omission contravenes the Regulations, fails to comply with an improvement notice, or re-lets a house in breach of a prohibition notice, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. If the contravention, failure to comply or re-letting is continued after conviction, the person shall be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention, failure to comply or re-letting continues and for each such offence shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;400 per day.</p><p>Local authorities are very responsive to requests to inspect private rented dwellings where a tenant believes the standards are not being met and in this regard, I would encourage tenants to contact their local authority and request an inspection to assess whether their accommodation meets the minimum requirements. Contact details for all local authorities can be found on the Department's website at: www.gov.ie/en/help/departments/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/list-of-county-councils/#local-authorities</p><p><i>Housing for All</i>sets a target for the inspection of rental properties, which is 25% of all private residential tenancies. A total of &euro;9 million in Exchequer funding is being made available to local authorities this year to help them meet their targets.</p><p>My Department maintains regular contact with relevant stakeholders in the housing sector, including Threshold, to address any issues arising.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021/22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.   </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  Decisions in regard to measures for the 2022/23 school year will be made shortly.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p></reply>

The &euro;10 increase in all earnings Working Family Payment thresholds results in an increased payment of &euro;6 per week.</p>  <p>  In addition, every household in the country has benefitted from the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;200.</p>  <p>  These measures are a continuation of the Government&rsquo;s policy of targeted social welfare increases which has seen significant increases to ancillary payments such as the Fuel Allowance, Living Alone Allowance and Qualified Child payment over the lifetime of this Government, aimed at protecting the most vulnerable recipients. Research has shown that this approach has been effective in recent years, and Ireland&rsquo;s system continues to be one of the most effective at tackling poverty across the EU. </p>  <p>  As part of the Budget 2022 package, I announced significant improvements to the means test for Carer's Allowance, in recognition of the vital role that carers play in society.  </p>  <p>  The general weekly income disregard for Carer's Allowance will be increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple.  This will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for the scheme, and those currently in receipt of a reduced payment may now receive a higher payment.</p>  <p>  The capital disregard will also be increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  This will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide care for a loved one, to retain an entitlement to Carer's Allowance</p>  <p>  In addition to these changes to the means test, all recipients of a weekly carers payment will have seen a &euro;5 increase from January 2022.  Those with children will also have seen an increase in the qualified child payment - &euro;2 increase for children under the age of 12, and &euro;3 for children aged 12 and over - bringing these payments to &euro;40 and &euro;48 per week respectively.</p>  <p>  These increases, along with the increase in the general income disregard will provide some protection to recipients of Carer's Allowance who face increased travel costs.</p>  <p>  Any further changes to the means test for Carer's Allowance would need to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist qualifying households with their energy costs.  To help mitigate the increased cost of heating a household, two additional lumpsum payments of &euro;125 and &euro;100 were approved for those in receipt of fuel allowance. This means that low-income households will see an increase of 55% in Fuel allowance support provided during this Fuel Allowance season compared to last season.  A recipient household which would have received &euro;735 in fuel season 2020/2021 would see an increase of &euro;404 to &euro;1,139 in Fuel Allowance payments in fuel season 2021/2022.  </p>  <p>  The Household Benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66, who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. The electricity or gas allowance element of the HHB is paid at a rate of &euro;35 a month.</p>  <p>  Telephone Support Allowance (TSA) is a weekly payment of &euro;2.50. People in receipt of certain qualifying payments from the Department as well as the Living Alone Allowance and Fuel Allowance will automatically qualify for the TSA. TSA supports recipients by assisting them with the cost of communications and/or home security solutions. The primary objective of the TSA is to support the most vulnerable people at risk of isolation, including the elderly and those with disabilities, access to critical communications infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents. Under the SWA scheme my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  In addition, support can be provided through a supplement under the SWA scheme which can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary. </p>  <p>  Decisions on ENPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p><p>To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%.  <table>    <tr>       <th>National Vacancy Rate By Age (June 2021) </th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Up to 1 year (0-12 months) </td>       <td>20% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 year+ to 2 years (13-24 months) </td>       <td>10% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 years+ to 3 years (25-36 months) </td>       <td>17% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years+ to 4 years (37-48 months) </td>       <td>17% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) Non-School-Going </td>       <td>12% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) School-Going </td>       <td>42% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) Non-school going </td>       <td>30% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) School going </td>       <td>48% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 years+ to 8 years (73-96 months) </td>       <td>37% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 years+ </td>       <td>34% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>21% </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department is continuing to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, with a particular focus on monitoring Covid-19 impacts as public health restrictions have been lifted.</p><p>Pobal has, using the data captured in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected vacancy rates in February 2022. While this analysis shows a fall in vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates falling from 21% to 19%, this analysis suggests that there is unused capacity across the country.</p><p>Pobal has commenced the new data collection as of 4 April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established.</p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

A Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee has been established by the Judicial Council, to support the work of the Council in relation to the development of sentencing guidelines, and neither I nor my Department has any role in the operation of the Council or its Committees. </p>  <p>  I understand that the  Judicial Council has adopted guidelines in relation to Judicial conduct and ethics on 4 February this year and the Council is promoting and maintaining a high standard of conduct amongst Judges having regard to these guidelines. </p></reply>

This situation continues to present a high risk of transmission to the prison population and this risk is higher with the increased movement of people in and out of our prisons. </p>  <p>  Restrictive measures have been modified in line with the various announcements made by Government and in line with advice from Public Health/HSE and the Irish Prison Service National Infection Control team. The Service is acutely aware of the need for prisoners to maintain contact with their families and the new video visit system which was introduced in 2020 continues to allow families to maintain contact with those in custody. </p>  <p>  Since 14 February 2022 the number of visitors permitted on an in-person visit increased to three people, two of whom may be a child (under 18 years of age). Prisoners are currently entitled to receive one thirty minute physical visit every fortnight and one video visit.  Prisoners may also choose to avail of a video visit instead of a physical visit if that is their preference. Although no decision has yet been taken in relation to the resumption of weekly visits, non-screened visits will recommence from Monday 9 May 2022 subject to necessary infection control measures. This will allow for physical contact between prisoners and their children. The potential return to weekly visits will be kept under constant review. </p></reply>

Ireland participates in this measure, which is given legal effect under section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p>  <p>  Those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine will generally be eligible for this temporary protection, initially for one year and on a renewable basis. It will provide beneficiaries with immediate access to the labour market, along with access to social welfare, accommodation and other State supports. </p>  <p>  There is no requirement for any beneficiary of temporary protection to have an employment permit issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to access the labour market. The temporary protection permission letter issued by my Department establishes the right of access. </p>  <p>  As with all applications for employment in the State, the personal credentials of the applicant and any specific qualifications, vetting or professional licence they require for the role should be verified by potential employers as part of the candidate selection process. My Department does not have a role in this process. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be further aware that the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults. It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016 and neither I, as Minister, nor my Department, have any role in the processing of vetting applications.</p>  <p>  Specifically, section 12 stipulates the requirement for "Relevant Organisations" to receive Vetting Disclosures from the Garda National Vetting Bureau prior to them employing individuals, regardless of their nationality, to conduct "relevant work or activities" in line with the Schedules set out in the Act.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda National Vetting Bureau do not assess the suitability of persons taking up relevant work or activities with Relevant Organisations. Rather, the Bureau issue Criminal Record Disclosures in line with the legislation, to assist Relevant Organisations in making safer recruitment decisions and it is the Relevant Organisation which makes the decision to employ or otherwise.</p>  <p>  All Relevant Organisations seeking to employ persons to conduct relevant work or activities are required to do so in line with the current legislation framework, as set out in the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable) Persons Acts 2012/2016.</p>  <p>  If a Relevant Organisation in Ireland is asking individuals to provide evidence of no convictions from another jurisdiction, then that is a request being made by that organisation as the decision maker on the suitability of a person to take up employment in Ireland.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, I am aware that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine provides a service for candidates to generate by themselves the relevant official non-conviction certificate through the recently launched online service vytiah.mvs.gov.ua/app/landing. However, I am informed that this Ukrainian non-conviction certificate is not a system that the National Vetting Bureau uses or has any further knowledge of.</p></reply>

Under section 7 of the Act, a review of the operation of the Act must be initiated within three years of the commencement of the Act, i.e., before January 2022.</p>  <p>  The Review is being led by an independent Chair and comprises of 2 main phases. As part of the first phase of the Review, information and evidence on the operation of the Act will be collected. There are 3 elements within the first phase of the Review; service user research, service provider research and public consultation.</p>  <p>  The second phase of the Review is being led by an independent Chair who will assess the extent to which the objectives of the 2018 Act have been achieved, analysing in that regard the findings of the three strands of information. The Minister for Health appointed Ms Marie O&rsquo;Shea B.L. as the independent Chair of the Review. </p>  <p>  A request for tender to carry out the research into the views of service providers was published on eTenders. The evaluation process has now concluded, and I am pleased to announce that the contract for this important research has been awarded to Manchester Metropolitan University. In line with the normal procurement process, my Department has been engaging with Manchester Metropolitan University to complete the necessary contractual arrangements. The objective of this research is to capture the views and experiences of service providers and will be a key input to the Review of the operation of the 2018 Act.</p>  <p>  Separately, the HSE's Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme commissioned research to understand people&rsquo;s experiences of using abortion care services and unplanned pregnancy supports. This research is being led by Dr Catherine Conlon of the School of Social Work and Social Policy at Trinity College Dublin. This work is ongoing and will also be a key input of the Review of the operation of the 2018 Act.</p></reply>

The number of registered pharmacists on the Register of Pharmacists held and maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator has continued to grow steadily, with an average increase of 187 registrants each year over the past five years. 6846 pharmacists are currently registered with the PSI, under established processes based in Irish and EU law, with 4371 of these registrants declaring their principal area of practice as community and a further 1250 not providing this information. ( www.thepsi.ie/Libraries/Monthly_Statistics/Pharmacists_-_Website_Statistics.sflb.ashx) . </p><p>The PSI is also the registering authority for pharmacies in Ireland in order that they may open and operate, and the number of Registered Retail Pharmacy Businesses currently stands at 1980.  </p><p>The Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) has drawn to my attention concerns it holds around shortage of pharmacists citing that Pharmacy employers are reporting that vacant permanent pharmacist positions are going unfilled for long periods and that short term locum relief pharmacists are increasingly difficult to source. The Department understands that the PSI, although not having a direct role in the recruitment of pharmacist are also aware of reports from stakeholders, of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce, with the concern being that the issue may be exacerbated into the future.</p><p>It is understood that the reports to the PSI of a current acute workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy, indicate that this is being driven in part by an increasing number of pharmacists choosing to work in a locum capacity.  This has a knock-on impact on pharmacist vacancies, and potentially on continuity and consistency of service. The PSI has been liaising with<b></b>stakeholders, including the IPU on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue. ?In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU. The PSI also circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support in efforts in understanding and addressing the issue in the short term, the results of which are pending. ?PSI has indicated its willingness to participate in a stakeholder group being established by the IPU, and the Department understands PSI and IPU are due to meet about this in early May.? </p><p>The PSI is also undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23, &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. In 2022, this project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;. </p><p>This is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries.  However, robust data for Ireland is needed to be able to determine the current landscape, assess future health system needs and understand existing sectoral challenges now and into the future.  It will be on the basis of gathering and analysing this up-to-date, robust and relevant data, that recommendations can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs for a pharmacist workforce in the future, as Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.  The European commission is currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project. Support includes recommendations for health and social care workforce reforms.</p></reply>

Section 19 of the Forestry Act 2014 details the instances where the felling of a tree is exempted. It is important to note that, while some trees are exempted from the need to obtain a tree felling licence, the Forest Service must be notified that felling is to take place and it will decide if the trees in question are exempted. These scenarios in the Forestry Act 2014 are identified by the use of the text &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo;. Some scenarios where the felling of trees is exempted and the Minister does not need to be notified are detailed on the Department's website gov.ie - Tree Felling Licences ()</p><p>Note that under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2011 the Local Authorities have a mandatory responsibility to include objectives in the Development Plan relating to the preserving of amenities. This empowers the planning authority to make provision for tree preservation by establishing a Tree Preservation Order (TPO). No tree covered by a TPO may be felled, topped, lopped or destroyed without the consent of the planning authority.</p><p>None of the exemptions granted under Section 19 of the Forestry Act 2014 serve to remove any restriction on the felling or removal of trees under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2013 or  any other enactment.</p><p>My Department's Forestry related Circular 5 of 2021 (re Clarification regarding Ash dieback scheme and planning permission), which I attach, outlines the advice my Department received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in relation to the &ldquo;replacement of Broadleaf High Forest with conifer species&rdquo;.  The Circular outlined the situations where planning permission from the Local Authority is required when replacing Broadleaf High Forest with Conifer species and when planning permission is not required. My Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH), with the objective of removing the planning permission requirement for these cases. </p><p>My Department's Forestry Licensing Plan 2022 was published earlier this year and deals with projected licensing output and approvals for support schemes.  A key target of the plan is to refocus on the delivery on approvals from the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) (Ash Dieback). My Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH), with the objective of removing the planning permission requirement for these cases. </p></reply>

On 25th March 2022 I  announced the implementation of a Brexit Blue economy Enterprise Development Scheme which aims to assist coastal communities to overcome the impacts of Brexit and grow and diversify their local economies by promoting the growth of the wider Blue Economy. It is being funded by an allocation of &euro;25 million under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve for the years 2022 and 2023. At its launch, I signalled that this funding was intended to help to stimulate entrepreneurial activity in the blue economy and provide a post-Brexit stimulus to the economies of our coastal communities.  BIM expect to invite applications in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The focus of this scheme on community-led local development is just one strand of the Government's overall response to the challenges facing our seafood industry and our coastal communities on foot of Brexit. The Deputy will be aware of other schemes launched in recent months such as the Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme launched in January and the Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme also announced on 25th March last which target other challenges identified by the Task Force.</p>  <p>  The remaining recommendations of the Task Force are being urgently examined across Government with regard to available funds, eligibility of the recommended measures for funding under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve and with regard to State Aid rules and the Public Spending Code. I hope to be in a position to make further announcements in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of each local authority to maintain the register of dog breeding establishments in its functional area.  The Act also places an obligation on any person seeking to operate a dog breeding establishment to have the premises included on the register. Welfare standards regarding dog breeding establishments have been provided for through guidelines, which also provide for unannounced inspections by local authorities. </p>  <p>Following a review, my Department is currently developing legislative amendments to the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, with a view to inclusion in the Government legislative programme.
