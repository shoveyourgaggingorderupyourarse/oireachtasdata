    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-04a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021030400065#WRA00500"><p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not collect or store the type of detailed information requested on data centre location, or their stage in the planning process.</p><p>There may be some scope for different definitions of what could be considered a data centre or multiple data 'halls' on particular sites might be counted. Nonetheless, it is clear that the vast majority of large 'hyperscale' or 'co-location'-type data centre developments are located in the greater Dublin area, with a small number operational or planned across Cork, Limerick, Meath and elsewhere.</p><p>While not all data centres are operated by multi-national firms, IDA Ireland has further advised me that it does not maintain a register of data centre locations. IDA Ireland point out that, when dealing with potential data centre investments, it promotes regional locations for those investments in line with the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy&rsquo;. Recent examples of large data centre developments outside of Dublin include an Amazon project in Drogheda and Facebook&rsquo;s project in Meath.</p><p>An analysis of the data centre sector in Ireland, including existing and planned data centres, is produced quarterly by industry groups BitPower and 'Host in Ireland'. The Deputy may find this a useful resource: </p><p>In terms of full-time permanent employment in the data centres themselves, it is estimated that data  centres require between 30 and 50 well paid and secure direct jobs each in areas such as management, IT and systems engineers, mechanical and electrical maintenance and repair management. However around 20,000 direct jobs in the Irish economy are supported by those who operate large data centre infrastructure here. The wider technology sector in Ireland employs in excess of 150,000 people. </p><p>Data centres are an increasingly important part of the digital and communications sectors and are core infrastructure in the remote working and digital services economy. The transition to a digital economy is well underway. It is impacting all sectors of the economy, and Ireland is well positioned as a digital gateway to Europe. Data centres and the services they provide act as a 'hook' for further investment and job creation. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-04a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021030400065#WRA00800"><p>Ireland has one of Europe&rsquo;s largest clusters of data centres as a stable energy grid, temperate climate and significant skills base makes Ireland an attractive country for this form of investment. Data centres are an increasingly important part of the digital and communications sectors and are core infrastructure in the remote working and digital services economy. The 2018 Government Statement on Data Centres sets out the strategic importance of data centres to Ireland&rsquo;s overarching enterprise policy and their role in attracting employment and investment to Ireland within the technology sector while it also sets out the challenges posed by the increased energy demand and steps to mitigate this. </p>  <p>  The State's planning system, at local level or through An Bord Pleanala, is the mechanism used to ensure that all industrial developments are consistent with our national policy as set out in the National Planning Framework and other strategic policy documents. The planning process incorporates public consultation processes and, where appropriate, environmental impact assessment, to ensure that development is consistent with the relevant regulations and national policy more broadly. Data centres in particular require detail engagement with the electricity grid connection process, managed by Eirgrid, to ensure they are consistent with our energy systems capacity. </p>  <p>  Data centres have an economic return in that they are an increasingly important part of the digital and communications sectors and are core infrastructure in the remote working and digital services economy. They also are significant capital intensive investments that act as a hook for further investment and job creation. Around 20,000 direct jobs in the Irish economy are supported by those who operate large data centre infrastructure here. The wider technology sector in Ireland employs in excess of 150,000 people.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate that it is one of the industries worst affected and for the longest and know that as we enter a second year of restrictions many in the sector must be fearing for their future.  </p>  <p>  The financial support the Government is providing businesses and workers affected by the pandemic is unprecedented. Almost a million people of working age are now in receipt of weekly payments including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Employment Wage Subsidy and Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance. Support for business includes the weekly CRSS payment for businesses forced to close their doors to the public, reduced VAT rates, a commercial rates holiday, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme as well as low-cost loans. </p>  <p>  The three main schemes, the CRSS, EWSS and PUP compare favourably with any other packages on offer in other countries.  The new Business Aid Scheme I announced recently will provide funding of up to &euro;8,000 for those businesses that are in receipt of a rates bill from their local authority. While the grant is modest, it will help smaller businesses in particular to cover these costs &ndash; rent, insurance, utilities, security. </p>  <p>  To date, I have not met with representatives from the wedding industry sector but I have met with representatives of the hospitality sector through the Tourism and Hospitality Forum.</p>  <p>  The Government is very much open to hearing proposals from the wedding sector as to how we can help further. Government schemes to support businesses are generally designed to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided, and it is not possible to provide compensation for loss of personal income or profits.</p>  <p>  My colleagues, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht and Minister Charlie McConalogue, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be able to provide more specific details on the events and hospitality industry and details on supports for the food sector respectively.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate that it is one of the industries worst affected and for the longest and know that as we enter a second year of restrictions many in the sector must be fearing for their future. I do hope that once the pandemic is over the wedding sector will have a number of good years with so many weddings postponed. In the meantime, the Government wants to make sure as many businesses as possible survive to see that day.</p>  <p>  The financial support the Government is providing businesses and workers affected by the pandemic is unprecedented. Almost a million people of working age are now in receipt of weekly payments including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), Employment Wage Subsidy (EWSS) and Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance. Support for business includes the weekly CRSS payment for businesses forced to close their doors to the public, reduced VAT rates, a commercial rates holiday, the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme as well as low cost loans.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the &euro;7 billion July Stimulus of enterprise measures, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst self-employed. We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses.</p>  <p>  As announced in the July Stimulus, the Enterprise Support Grant was extended to assist eligible self-employed, including sole traders, who exit the PUP or jobseekers schemes, to re-start their business. Further information is available at www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  On the 9th of December, following engagement with the Arts sector and other self-employed sectors my colleague Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Social Protection, announced the doubling of the PUP threshold from the current &euro;480 over four weeks to &euro;960 over an eight-week period effective immediately. This measure is to assist those who are trying to restart their businesses and will allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs without losing their entitlement to the PUP.</p>  <p>  The Government also announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector in Budget 2021. This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country. The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders. It will also be informed by the pilot live performance scheme in 2020 which is being rolled out now.</p>  <p>  The three main schemes, the CRSS, EWSS and PUP compare favourably with any other packages on offer in other countries. The new Business Aid Scheme I announced last month will provide funding of up to &euro;8,000 for those businesses that are in receipt of a rates bill from their local authority. While the grant is modest, it will help smaller businesses in particular to cover these costs &ndash; rent, insurance, utilities, security.</p>  <p>  The Government is very much open to proposals from the wedding sector as to how we can help further. However, Government schemes to support businesses are generally designed to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided and it is not possible to provide compensation for loss of personal income or profits.</p>  <p>  My colleagues, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht and Minister Charlie McConalogue, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be able to provide more specific details on the events and hospitality industry and details on supports for the food sector respectively.</p></reply>

Since 30th March, the employment permit system has been operating fully remotely and online. </p><p>Operational practices have been adjusted to replace the paper-based elements of the service to allow for a fully online process involving electronic/scanned documents and all decisions/outcomes now issue via e-mail rather than by post.  Agreement was reached with the Immigration Service Delivery in the Department of Justice and Equality on arrangements to introduce, on a temporary basis, a type of &ldquo;e-employment permit&rdquo; and a similar soft copy process to transition to permanent residence permission.</p><p>The contingency plan also states that my Department will be flexible in dealing with employment permit issues that arise for both employers and employees as a result of the pandemic and will consider such issues, including individuals who are unable to renew their passports as a result of the pandemic, on a case by case basis when brought to my Department's attention.  All such queries should be emailed to employmentpermits@enterprise.gov.ie </p><p>Finally, full details in relation to the contingency arrangements introduced by the Employment Permits Section in response to the pandemic can be accessed on my Department's website through the following link:   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-04a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021030400065#WRA02000"><p>The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is the largest loan guarantee scheme in the history of the State.   The Scheme provides &euro;2 billion in lending, for terms up to five-and-a-half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million.  It is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (business with less than 500 employees), including primary producers (businesses engaged in the farming and seafood sectors).</p>  <p>  The Scheme is currently available through commercial banks, a number of non-bank lenders and a number of credit unions. Since January, 19 Credit Unions and 3 non-bank lenders have successfully joined the scheme as finance providers and more finance providers are expected to join in the coming weeks. This long-term policy goal of diversification will add competition in the market and ensure a wide range of loan products being available.</p>  <p>  A total of 4,702 loan applications for a value of &euro;314 million have been submitted up to 18 February to all participating lenders with 3,106 loans drawn for a value of &euro;177 million.  A total of 4,556 loan applications with a value of &euro;298 million have been submitted to the three participating commercial banks (Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank) with 3,091 loans drawn for a value of &euro;175 million.  Loans take a number of working days to move from application status to drawdown or refused status. I would encourage businesses to use this scheme to obtain loans at interest rates below market rates. </p>  <p>  Where an applicant has had a loan application refused, they may wish to appeal the decision to the Credit Review Office (CRO).  The CRO helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review and the bank.</p>  <p>  While the State provides a guarantee on loans issued in case of default, all credit assessments in relation to loan applications under this scheme are carried out by participating lenders.  The Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process in relation to loans under Government schemes, which, is fully delegated to the participating lenders.  </p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that I and my officials are monitoring the Scheme and its effectiveness. Data is being published on a monthly basis on my Department&rsquo;s website regarding the level of lending through the scheme, the sectoral breakdown and the uptake on a county basis.  </p></reply>

A number of EU programmes also exist to support companies and researchers to develop new products, processes and services.  These programmes are documented by Knowledge Transfer Ireland and on the websites of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. In terms of "disruptive technologies", the main government funding is through the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (DTIF).</p>  <p>  The DTIF is a &euro;500 million fund established as part of the National Development Plan under Project Ireland 2040. It is administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  The Fund is available for collaborative projects seeking investment in the development and deployment of disruptive innovative technologies and applications, on a commercial basis, targeted at tackling national and global challenges. It is aimed at driving collaboration on industrial research projects between our world class research base and industry, as well as facilitating enterprises to compete directly for funding in support of the development and adoption of these technologies and seeding a new wave of start-ups.</p>  <p>  A particular focus of the Fund is to encourage research, development and innovation collaboration between enterprises located in Ireland, working with one or more Research Performing Organisations (RPOs), including third-level institutions such as universities and Institutes of Technology / Technological Universities. </p>  <p>  Under Calls 2 and 3 of the DTIF, collaborations were required to have at least three project partners, one of which must be a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) and at least one other enterprise &ndash; either an SME or a large enterprise. Large-scale projects seeking DTIF funding of at least &euro;1.5 million were eligible.</p>  <p>  Funding allocations have been announced under two Calls to date, with a total of &euro;140m allocated to 43 projects. Applications received under the third Call, which was launched in September 2020, are currently being evaluated by panels of international expert evaluators, with awards expected to be made by the end of March 2021.</p></reply>

Work in relation to recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme including the issue of repeat upgrade visits has been ongoing in recent months and is nearing completion.  However, a number of other significant developments in relation to the scheme have taken place over the last 6 months which will be of interest to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Firstly, funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. This funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades, making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to allow it drive the various grant programmes that it operates, including the Warmer Homes Scheme, and to ensure that level of activity envisaged under the Programme for Government is delivered. </p></reply>

An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched.

This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir for the area, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers, and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection.</p><p>The network rollout is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country. These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the eir exchanges or the metropolitan area networks (MANs) managed by Enet. It is based on an engineering design that allows NBI to get to every premises as quickly as possible working within the confines of how fibre networks are built. The deployment plan forecasts construction commenced in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>Since January 2020, NBI has mobilised the staff, subcontractors, infrastructure and material providers required to deliver the NBP and is currently providing direct and indirect employment to over 900 people. These levels will continue to increase as the roll out ramps up.  <b></b></p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 24 February 2021, over 181,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is well ahead of the target anticipated by NBI.  In Tipperary 8,643 premises have been surveyed including in the areas of Tipperary, Aherloe, Ballinalard and Bansha. Surveys are progressing in the Roscea area and surrounding townlands, Cashel, Townspark, Boherlahan, Goolds Cross, Knockavilla, Garrenroe, Camus Bridge, Golden, Shanballa, Dogstown, Racecourse Cross, Rosegreen, Knockbrett, Mayfield, Boscobell and Dualla.  Build works have commenced in Tipperary and the surrounding townlands of Aherloe, Ballinalard and Bansha and pre-build works have commenced in Clonmel.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Tipperary through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 24 February, 275 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for schools. BCP sites installed in Tipperary are Drom Community Centre, Killoscully Community Centre and Killea GAA Club.  Sites at Moyglass Community Hall, Killurney Community Centre and Aglish Community Centre are installed and connected.  Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Poulacapple National School and Killeen National School are connected as part of this initiative for educational access only. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at .</p></reply>

Motor tax is payable on an annual, half-yearly or quarterly basis.However, there is a facility in place to declare a vehicle off the road where it is not going to be in use in a public place. The Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act came into effect on 1 July 2013. The primary purpose of the Act was to replace a system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively, which was unverifiable, with a system under which a vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Act, a declaration must be made in the last month of an existing motor tax disc or renewed in the last month of a previously made declaration of non-use. The declaration can be made for any number of calendar months between 3 and 12 months i.e. it cannot be made for a period of 1 or 2 months. If a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle.</p>  <p>  Where a declaration is not made in advance, arrears of motor tax must be paid in full and motor tax paid for a minimum of 3 months before a declaration of non-use can then be made in the final month of the tax disc.</p></reply>

These services were closed during the first Covid-19 lockdown and were operating with limited capacity in the months following re-opening. During the current level 5 period, driving tests are available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work. The Driver Theory Test Service has not been deemed to be an essential service under Level 5 restrictions, and the service will remain closed for the duration of level 5 restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority has set up a dedicated webform so that essential workers can request a driving test. Anyone looking for an urgent driving test appointment and who falls into this category can apply to book a driving test using the online form.</p>  <p>  While the services are limited at present, the RSA are examining ways of creating additional capacity for after level 5. This will include a combination of additional staff and extended opening hours. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Department approved the rehire during 2020 of 36 temporary driver testers whose contracts had expired.  Subsequently, the Department has approved the hiring of an additional 40 temporary testers for 22 months.  This additional capacity will help the RSA to reduce the backlog and return gradually to the normal target of a maximum waiting time of 10 weeks for a driving test.</p>  <p>  The provision of extra testers will not on its own suffice to address the problem.  One of the difficulties is with the capacity of test centres themselves, given limits on throughput due to Covid restrictions.  It will also take time for the 40 testers to be hired and trained. </p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased. Any decision on this matter will be guided by health protocols. </p>  <p>  The RSA, together with the Driver Theory Test service provider, have also put plans in place to significantly increase capacity within the service when it is allowed to re-open. To cope with the initial four-month suspension, the service increased capacity from an average pre Covid19 capacity of 15,000 to over 25,000 monthly. A plan is being progressed to increase this capacity up to 50,000 per month when service resumes, to manage the backlog of customers and shorten waiting times.</p>  <p>  As you can appreciate, the first priority has to be public safety &ndash; we want to provide services, and we know that people are looking for services, but services can only be provided to the limit possible while preserving public health.</p>  <p>  My priority as Minister is to see that the RSA is able to deliver its services in the safest way possible. We are all in the grip of a pandemic at the moment, and I know people are frustrated, but I believe people also understand that there is no easy path through this and that we all have to be patient.</p></reply>

For a project in this category, &quot;Decision Gate 1: Preliminary Business Case&quot; is the first stage where the <i>Public Spending Code</i>stipulates that formal Government approval is required. </p><p>In the case of the DART+ investment proposal, I understand that the Preliminary Business Case is currently at an advanced stage of development and the costs of the DART+ are being considered as part of this.  In accordance with the <i>Public Spending Code's </i>requirements, once the Preliminary Business Case has been approved by the National Transport Authority (NTA) it will be submitted to my Department for review and will also be subject to a technical review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform<i>.</i>Following completion of that work, I will then bring the Preliminary Business Case to Government for its decision.</p><p>On the question of COVID-19 related delays, while there has obviously been disruption I understand that there have not been any particularly significant delays given that, essentially, the project is currently at the planning stage.  I am aware that there is a tender evaluation process underway, but would note that its ultimate finalisation is linked to the finalisation and approval of the Preliminary Business Case, as is required under the <i>Public Spending Code</i>.</p></reply>

Extending these statutory arrangements to all of Ireland&rsquo;s cities will strengthen the levels of integration between spatial planning and transport planning across the country, to the benefit of our economy and society.</p><p>It should also be highlighted that the NTA works collaboratively with local authorities outside its statutory area and statutory functions on a regular basis. It has worked successfully on an administrative, non-statutory basis to assist several local authorities across Ireland in preparing transport related strategies or implementing transport related projects.</p><p>While there are no current plans to extend the current statutorily-defined Greater Dublin Area to include County Louth, it is the case that the NTA has supported, and is supporting, the enhancement of sustainable mobility options in Drogheda already. These improvements include the expansion of town bus services in the town, most recently with last year&rsquo;s announcement which I know the Deputy has previously welcomed. Also the NTA is of course developing the DART+ programme with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann which has the potential to radically improve the town&rsquo;s rail connections. The NTA is also consulting with local authorities across the country in relation to a potential enhancement of more rural bus services under the <i>Connecting Ireland</i>initiative.</p><p>As the Deputy can see from the above, it is the case that County Louth, and Drogheda, has access to, and benefits from, the expertise of the NTA and I look forward to continued improvements in its sustainable mobility infrastructure and services in the years ahead. </p></reply>

At the same time, the employment may also be subject to tax in the country in which the work is carried out. In accordance with general principles of international tax, where instances of double taxation arise on the same income, relief against Irish tax may be claimed by way of a credit for any foreign tax already paid, subject to the terms of any applicable Double Taxation Agreement (DTA). Unilateral relief may also be available in certain circumstances under domestic Irish legislation.</p>  <p>  In the case of a person who lives in the State but who works in Northern Ireland, the terms of the Ireland/UK DTA provide for relief by allowing the Irish resident to claim a credit for the UK tax paid against any Irish tax that may be due on the same income.</p>  <p>  The relief referred to by the Deputy is in addition to the above, and may apply, subject to certain conditions, where a person lives in Ireland but works wholly outside of the State.</p>  <p>  I would advise the Deputy that this relief applies not only to persons with a UK based employment, but also for employments in the EU and DTA-network regions in compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s treaty obligations. It therefore has broader application beyond the Northern Ireland issues raised.</p>  <p>  The conditions for this Trans-Border relief are set out in section 825A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997. In general, in order to qualify for this relief the individual must:</p>  <p>  - Be tax resident in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - work in a country that Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement with in an employment held for a continuous period of 13 weeks in the year;</p>  <p>  -the employment duties must be wholly exercised outside of the State with none performed in the State, save for duties considered incidental to the foreign employment;</p>  <p>  - have paid tax in the other country and are not due a refund of the tax; and</p>  <p>  - be present in Ireland for at least one day for every week they work abroad.</p>  <p>  Where the Trans-Border relief applies in the case of an Irish resident who works in the UK, it operates in such a way that only UK tax is charged on the employment income and there is no charge to Irish tax on the same income. Any additional Irish tax that may be due is foregone under the domestic Irish legislation.</p>  <p>  This tax relief is not normally available for Irish residents who work from home in Ireland. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Revenue have confirmed that if employees are required to work from home in the State due to COVID-19, such days spent working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met.</p>  <p>  The flexibility being shown in the context of the pandemic does not impact the general operation of the measure which requires that a person works outside the State and pays tax in the other jurisdiction in order to qualify for the relief.</p>  <p>  I am aware that this issue has been raised specifically in relation to Irish residents who work in Northern Ireland and as I indicated at Report Stage of Finance Act 2020, I have asked my officials to look at the operation of the measure through the Tax Strategy Group 2021 process. </p>  <p>  This process will consider matters such as the equity of treatment between Irish residents in respect of employments carried out in Ireland, the competitive position of Irish employers, and concerns regarding the potential for double non-taxation and established principles of international tax.</p>  <p>  I would also note that the matter will need to be examined in the overall context of Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership, noting that it would likely not be possible for Ireland to give preferential treatment to UK based employments or Northern Ireland based employments only without also giving similar treatment to other EU Member States or DTA jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  I would also like to assure the Deputy that in circumstances where this relief does not apply, relief for foreign tax may be applicable in the normal course set out above.</p></reply>

It is therefore a matter for the lender to determine its own lending policies and the factors it considers appropriate in the context of its credit assessment.  There are no geographic restrictions in regulations as set out by the Deputy in his question.</p>  <p>  With respect to mortgage credit, there are regulatory requirements in place to ensure that lenders lend prudently.  Before providing credit or mortgage credit, lenders are required to undertake thorough creditworthiness assessments to ensure a borrower will be able to repay. This assessment must take into account the individual circumstances of the borrower, including personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  More generally there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.   </p>  <p>  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  </p></reply>

To the extent it is not reasonably practicable to hold or invest assets on this basis, assets are to be held or invested on a commercial basis with a view to seeking appropriate rates of return having regard to the risk and duration.  </p><p>In 2020, ISIF adopted a Sustainability &amp;amp; Responsible Investment Strategy (S&amp;amp;RIS) which reflects a commitment to be a responsible investor as steward of public assets by protecting and enhancing both the long-term value of the ISIF and the reputation of NTMA in how it delivers its mandate, as manager and controller of the ISIF.  In this context ISIF operates an exclusion policy which is consistent with its statutory mandate.  Exclusion is used on a limited basis, reflecting exclusions mandated by legislation (such as the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018 or the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008) and, <i>inter alia</i>, on sustainable investment grounds. </p><p>The current total number of companies excluded from ISIF&rsquo;s investment portfolio is 278, whose names are listed below. This list includes companies involved with cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines, tobacco or fossil fuel exploration, extraction and/or refinement, as explained on ISIF&rsquo;s website. It has recently been decided that the ISIF&rsquo;s exclusion policy be extended to include direct investment in companies that have been verified to be involved in the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons or critical component parts.  This divestment process is currently underway.</p><p>ISIF's fossil fuel exclusion list is detailed below: <table>    <tr>       <th>No.</th>       <th>Fossil Fuel Exclusion List</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1</td>       <td>Aboitiz Power Corp</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2</td>       <td>Adaro Energy Tbk PT</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3</td>       <td>AES Corp/VA</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4</td>       <td>AGL Energy Limited</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5</td>       <td>Aker BP ASA</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6</td>       <td>ALBERTA ENERGY CO   LTD</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7</td>       <td>Alliant Energy Corp</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8</td>       <td>Ameren Corp</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>9</td>       <td>American Electric   Power Co.

It would complement cash, not replace it.</p>  <p>  The report raised a number of questions concerning how and when a digital euro could be introduced. The Eurosystem is conducting further analysis to fully understand the challenges and benefits that could emerge from the introduction of a digital euro. The technical implementation of a digital euro needs to be thoroughly tested and legal considerations carefully examined before any decision on issuance is taken. This item was discussed at Eurogroup in November 2020.</p>  <p>  Towards mid-2021, having considered the responses received to its public consultation, the ECB will decide whether to launch a digital euro project. If a project is launched, policy decisions around the design and technical options will be reached by the Eurosystem, in consultation with European stakeholders including the European Commission.  The Central Bank of Ireland, as a member of the Eurosystem, will fully participate in this important strategic initiative and engage with national stakeholders, including the Department of Finance, at appropriate points as this work progresses.</p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Finance I have not received any representations on the issue of a digital euro to date. To be of assistance, in my role as President of the Eurogroup I have received correspondence which referenced this issue: </p>  <p>  - In October 2020 the ECB wrote in regard to the Digital Euro&rsquo;s inclusion on the subsequently published Eurogroup work programme. </p>  <p>  - In November 2020 an organisation called &lsquo;Blockchain for Europe&rsquo; sent me the findings of research they had undertaken on digital payments. </p>  <p>  - In January 2021 the ECB wrote noting that their public consultation on a digital euro had closed.</p>  <p>  I welcome more detailed analysis, more information and more discussion on the potential development of a digital euro. My Department supports the examination of this issue and officials will work with colleagues in EU institutions to ensure that this concept is examined at an appropriate pace and all aspects are considered carefully and thoroughly.</p></reply>

The FSG discussed global stablecoins at its meeting in September 2019.  The FSG maintains a watching brief on any potential financial stability issues arising from cryptocurrencies. </p>  <p>  The issue of the potential financial stability impact of cryptocurrencies is also under active consideration by European supervisory agencies and regulators. The European supervisory agencies have carried out much work on this issue over the last few years and on 24 September 2020 the European Commission released its Digital Finance Package. This contains a proposal for a new EU legislative framework for the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which aims to enable markets in crypto-assets, including asset-referenced tokens (also known as stablecoins) and utility tokens as well as the tokenisation of traditional financial assets and wider use of Distributed Ledger Technology (e.g. blockchain) in financial services.  This harmonised approach towards developing an appropriate regulatory framework for the markets in crypto-assets is welcome.</p>  <p>  In April 2020 the Central Bank issued its response to the European Commission public consultation on the Markets in Crypto-Assets, highlighting the views of the Central Bank on crypto-assets. Its analysis highlights that the risks associated with certain cryptocurrencies such as so called global stablecoins include risks to financial stability, monetary policy, consumer and investor protection, legal certainty and compliance with anti money laundering/countering-financing terrorism requirements and these are a key concern. Among the key concerns is that the issuing of currency should firmly remain under the remit of the relevant public authorities (i.e. central bank). Where the reach or other features of cryptocurrencies or so called stablecoin risk it being perceived as a currency, or operating as a quasi-currency, then it should be prohibited. </p>  <p>  At an EU level while the development of an appropriate regulatory framework continues, it is important to highlight that there is a consensus to adopt a conservative prudential approach towards crypto assets which is line with that set out in the European Banking Authority&rsquo;s January 2019 report.</p>  <p>  While the Department of Finance and the Central Bank support innovations that increase the efficiency of financial services to consumers, innovations are not supported that fail to reach the high standards and controls that protect consumers and underpin the integrity of the financial system or those which put financial stability at risk.   </p>  <p>  The potential impact of cryptocurrencies also continue to be the subject of analysis by the Financial Stability Board, and they have produced high level recommendations on the regulation, supervision and oversight of global stablecoins. The FSB intend to take stock of progress in implementing these recommendations later this year and report to the G20. </p>  <p>  In relation the impact of cryptocurrencies on the tax base, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it does not differentiate income derived from, or transactions involving, cryptocurrencies as separate from other income types or financial transactions when taxpayers are making declarations in relation to their income or profits. In this regard, the normal self-assessment taxation rules applies to taxpayers in relation to income derived from cryptocurrencies. The Revenue Commissioner operates a risk-based compliance framework that uses advanced analytics in a Risk Evaluation Analysis and Profiling (REAP) system to detect non-compliant behaviour. Risks in relation to cryptocurrencies are included in the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s compliance framework. </p></reply>

I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  The application of interest rate charges is solely a commercial matter for the board and management of each bank. </p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the Covid19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in large part it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.</p></reply>

The aim of this note is to provide high-level guidance to assist organisations in making decisions in relation to the adoption of cloud services. Organisations should no longer decide whether to move to cloud for new or existing systems. The decision to be made now is what, how and when to move to cloud, which can offer a step change in carbon efficiency, security and value for money. </p>  <p>  The document does not go into the technical and functional features of the infrastructure to supply a cloud computing environment and it does not recommend particular providers, products or solutions, either public or private. The advice is clear that while organisations may outsource their responsibility for the delivery of a service to a cloud service provider, they cannot outsource their accountability for that service.</p>  <p>  It is the Government's belief that that now is an opportune time for a more proactive and progressive approach  to embracing cloud computing and that all new government systems should be developed to exploit the opportunities presented by cloud deployment, where possible, and all existing systems will be reviewed for cloud capability for any category of public service information or system, except where such data would be classified as &lsquo;top secret&rsquo; as per Circular 39/07.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement guidance note on cloud services provides complementary help in the form of guidance on the mechanisms for procuring cloud solutions. </p>  <p>  More information on the Departments Cloud Computing Advice Note can be found on www.gov.ie.</p></reply>

In regard to tourism, these measures include:</p><p>- The first phase of  the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme was launched on 11th  February by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to help strategic tourism business survive the pandemic and drive recovery. The Scheme will contribute to the fixed costs of identified tourism businesses that are not eligible for CRSS to support their survival.  It will provide an equitable level of payment to the CRSS for qualifying businesses and the first phase will cover businesses such as tourism attractions, activity providers, and caravan and camping sites.</p><p>- A &euro;26m adaptation fund for the tourism sector to adapt their premises to meet COVID-19 safety requirements. </p><p>- In addition, the Government has introduced a number of horizontal measures that have been of assistance to the tourism sector including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), tax warehousing, and the Commercial Rates waiver.  In regard to the CRSS, as at 25 February 2021, Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; data shows that &euro;329m was paid out under CRSS, of which approximately 63% (&euro;206m) was in respect of the tourism and hospitality sector.</p><p>The measures introduced have been critical in assisting tourism businesses to survive the hugely challenging situation brought about by the pandemic. Unfortunately, the evolution of the pandemic in Ireland and elsewhere has meant that our tourism sector has remained in survival mode.  </p><p>On 23 February the Government published <i>COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 The Path Ahead</i>.  The Government also decided to support businesses, including tourism businesses, by extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the current commercial rates waiver for a further three months.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment was also extended until end-June.</p><p>The Government has also committed to publishing a National Economic Recovery Plan.  As part of the Plan the Government will consider more targeted measures to help re-boot those sectors, such as tourism, who will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens.</p><p>In regard to further information on supports for the sector in question, I have referred the Deputy's question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

A key objective of this policy is to increase access to and participation in the arts.  Primary responsibility for promoting practice of the arts, including dance, rests with the Arts Council under the Arts Act 2003. </p><p>The strategic context for the Arts Council&rsquo;s support of dance and all other artforms and areas of arts practice is set out in <i>Making Great Art Work: Arts Council Strategy (2016 &ndash;2025). </i>It describes how the Arts Council will lead the development of the arts in Ireland. The strategy has five priority areas: the artist; public engagement; investment strategy; spatial and demographic planning; and developing capacity. The Arts Council's current dance policy, <i>Dance Policy and Strategy 2018</i>,  is aligned to the key objectives and desired outcomes of <i>Making Great Art Work</i>.</p><p>Dance is a widely practised artform in Ireland and covers activities which range from highly trained professional dancers who earn their income from their art to people of all ages engaging in various forms of dance as a hobby. </p><p>The Arts Council supports dance across a number of genres through grant programmes and awards, and invests in future developments through special initiatives devised in partnership with others. The Arts Council have in place a number of schemes and initiatives for the particular support of dance and a list of dance organisations funded by the Arts Council can be viewed on the website at the following links   . The Arts Council&rsquo;s current dance policy is published on its website at this link </p><p>My Department, in the context of its overall mission to promote, nurture and develop Ireland's culture and arts, delivers further supports for dance including through Creative Ireland initiatives.  While the focus of the Programme is on creativity as a strategy, dance has featured in that regard.  Under Pillar II Enabling Creativity in Every Community (or Creative Communities), the Creative Ireland Programme partnered with each of the 31 local authorities to deploy creativity as a strategy for wellbeing, social cohesion and economic development.  In doing so, Creative Communities has enabled local authorities to support a significant number of dance-related projects across a wide range of dance forms. </p><p>In addition, my Department provides funding to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;), which is the largest organisation involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music and dance.  CC&Eacute; has hundreds of branches in every Irish county including in small towns and villages.  My Department provides annual funding to CC&Eacute; for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish dance, Irish traditional music and culture.</p><p>Culture Ireland creates and supports opportunities for Irish artists and companies to present and promote their work, including dance, at strategic international festivals and venues, and develops platforms to present outstanding Irish work to international audiences, through showcases at key global arts events, including the Edinburgh Festivals. </p><p>My Department does not have responsibility for oversight of the commercial provision of dancing in the State. </p></reply>

The construction sector had responded well to the challenges presented by COVID-19 during 2020 with effective protocols put in place. However, the trajectory of the disease was such that the Government took the decision that most construction should cease with effect from 8 January 2021.  The Regulations in place provide for certain exemptions to allow the continuation of certain essential construction activity.  The exemptions were based on decisions taken by the Government and extend beyond the remit of my own Department.</p><p>On 23 February, the Government announced that the current level 5 restrictions will remain in place until 5 April 2021, when the easing of restrictions relating to construction will be considered. </p><p>The Housing Agency is mantaining a register of projects, which have been designated as essential social housing projects under the Regulations.

My Department is currently working to establish the structures to examine the issue of defective housing in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. </p><p>I recently appointed Mr Seamus Neely, former Chief Executive of Donegal County Council, to the position of Chair to the independent working group. </p><p>In addition, I brought a Memorandum for the Information of the Government to Cabinet recently to note the establishment of a working group with the appropriate expertise to examine the issue of defective housing. It is intended to hold the inaugural plenary working group meeting shortly. </p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others.</p><p>Separately, Government is supporting homeowners of dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave and defective concrete blocks through the Pyrite Remediation Scheme and the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme. Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;40 million to fund both initiatives.</p><p>In addition, the ongoing building control reform agenda, with its many initiatives, already provides a comprehensive roadmap for embedding a culture of real compliance within the construction industry. The reform agenda includes:</p><p>- Amendments made to the Building Control Regulations;</p><p>- Establishment of the National Building Control Office; and</p><p>- The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (ConstructionIndustryRegister Ireland) Bill.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-04a.207.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021030400068#WRD04800"><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) was established on an interim basis in September 2018, by way of an Establishment Order made under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, pending the enactment of the Land Development Agency Bill. </p><p>On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. As most sites are currently at the pre-planning stage, the exact delivery potential for each site will only be finalised as final plans are put in place and planning permission is sought. The sites concerned are as follows:</p><p>1. Central Mental Hospital Site, Dundrum </p><p>2. Hampton, Balbriggan</p><p>3. Hacketstown, Skerries </p><p>4. Devoy Barracks, Naas</p><p>5. Former Meath Hospital, Dublin City Centre</p><p>6. St. Kevin's Hospital, Cork</p><p>7. Columb Barracks, Mullingar</p><p>8. Dyke Road, Galway</p><p>Seven of these sites will be developed directly by the LDA while Dyke Road will be developed in partnership with the relevant authority.  It is currently envisaged that ownership of these seven sites will not transfer to the LDA until the LDA Bill is enacted. The Bill was recently published and is currently going through Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p><p>The absence of the primary legislation is not preventing the LDA from progressing these sites.  In addition, because the sites are public lands, rather than lands in private ownership, the issue of ownership and transfer is not an obstacle to early progress. The LDA has entered into pre-sale agreements with the land owners, as appropriate, to ensure that it has full access to the sites to carry out necessary pre-construction activities. Significant preparatory work is already underway in relation to the sites, with feasibility, planning and other preparatory works already initiated. </p><p>For example, the LDA has secured planning permission for 597 units at Shanganagh in conjunction with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and has submitted a Strategic Housing Development application for the St. Kevin&rsquo;s Hospital site in Cork City in December 2020. The LDA intends to submit planning applications for other sites in 2021. </p><p>The LDA is also working in partnership with other local authorities around the country. It is running a design review of the Sandy Road Regeneration Project in Galway which has the potential for up to 1,000 homes, and it is also working with Limerick City and County Council on a site near Colbert Station, funding a masterplan of the site. A Cork Docklands Delivery Office was also established by Cork City Council in partnership with the LDA. The focus of this office is on supporting and catalysing the Cork Docklands area. In conjunction with Dublin City Council the LDA has recently opened an early stage consultation on a site at St. Teresa's Gardens with potential for 700 housing units.

This national-level planning policy is implemented at the regional level through statutory Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) for each of the three Regional Assembly areas.</p>  <p>  Subsequent to the NPF, a RSES was accordingly prepared by the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly (EMRA) and formally adopted in June 2019.  Section 25A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended requires relevant specified public bodies, and each local authority within the Regional Assembly area, to prepare and submit a report to the Regional Assembly every 2 years, setting out progress made in supporting the objectives set out in the Strategy that are relevant to that body.  </p>  <p>  Further to this, the Regional Assembly must prepare a monitoring report every 2 years to report on progress made in implementing its RSES, including in relation to actions specific to the relevant public bodies, and submit the report to the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC).  Following consideration of the monitoring report, the Commission may make recommendations to the Minister in relation to relevant measures to further support the implementation of the RSES.</p>  <p>  The first EMRA RSES monitoring report is currently being prepared by the Regional Assembly for publication in June 2021. Following the finalisation of the RSESs, all local authorities have commenced, or are shortly to commence, the statutory review of their County or City Development Plan and this process will be ongoing in 2022.  In accordance with Section 12 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, it is a statutory obligation of each local authority to ensure that the County Development Plan is consistent with the national and regional development objectives of the NPF and the relevant RSES.  Since April 2019, the assessment of all statutory local authority development plans, including variations to development plans and local area plans, is undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR).  The statutory oversight role of the OPR includes ensuring that local authority plans are consistent with relevant national and regional policies.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is sufficient in-built scope in the current statutory processes, including biannual reporting between the regional assemblies and relevant public bodies and local authorities in monitoring progress in relation to the implementation of the RSES, and the interaction between the county development plans and RSES, to take account of any changes that may be required to reflect and maintain appropriate planning and sustainable principles over the lifetime of the RSES.</p></reply>

This provides that a local authority may take measures or engage in activities that it considers necessary to promote the interests of the local community in relation to matters such as general recreational and leisure activities, including the provision of parks and open spaces. </p>  <p>  In the context of proposed new development, the preparation of statutory development plans is a central function of a planning authority undertaken in accordance with sections 9-13 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 (as amended). The zoning of land for particular uses, including for open amenity space, is a reserved function of the planning authority.  In preparing development plans, consideration and decisions on the zoning of particular lands is therefore a matter for the elected members and is required to be consistent with established statutory national and regional planning policy and legislation, including the National Planning Framework, Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) and statutory Ministerial planning guidelines as appropriate.  In this regard, guidance in relation to amenity and quality of life issues, including, inter alia, public open spaces and area-wide green space strategies, is set out in the Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas &ndash; Guidelines for Planning Authorities published by my Department in 2009.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, in line with their statutory role as outlined above, decisions in relation to auditing public green space and engagement with the HSE/Public Health on related issues are matters for individual local authorities.</p></reply>

In addition, Section 48 of the Act makes provision for development contribution schemes, which may establish the requirement for the payment of a financial contribution as a condition of planning permission for development, for public infrastructure and facilities.  This may be for the purposes of land acquisition and/or the provision of open spaces and recreational facilities, as follows - Section 48(17):-</p><p>&ldquo;In this section&mdash; &ldquo;public infrastructure and facilities&rdquo; means&mdash;</p><p>(a)the acquisition of land,</p><p>(b)the provision of open spaces, recreational and community facilities and</p> <blockquote> 	  	 <blockquote> 	amenities and landscaping works,<br /><br />(c)the provision of roads, car parks, car parking places, surface water sewers<br /><br />and flood relief work, and ancillary infrastructure,<br /><br />(d)the provision of bus corridors and lanes, bus interchange facilities (including <blockquote> 	car parks for those facilities), infrastructure to facilitate public transport,<br /><br />cycle and pedestrian facilities, and traffic calming measures, </blockquote>(e)the refurbishment, upgrading, enlargement or replacement of <blockquote> 	roads, car parks, car parking places, surface water sewers, flood relief work<br /><br />and ancillary infrastructure, </blockquote>(f)the provision of high-capacity telecommunications infrastructure, such as<br /><br />broadband,<br /><br />(g)the provision of school sites, and<br /><br />(h)any matters ancillary to paragraphs (a) to (g). </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>I am satisfied that there are adequate policy and legislative measures available to address the issues raised in the question, both in terms of existing settlements and in forward planning for new development.</p></reply>

We are ambitious to ramp up the delivery at local authority level and we are committed to developing housing on public land.</p><p>My Department provides both capital and current funding to local authorities across a range of funding initiatives to assist them in providing homes for families and individuals on their social housing waiting lists.  To provide transparency on the new social housing projects being advanced, my Department publishes a Social Housing Construction Status Report each quarter with details of all social housing developments completed or under construction in each local authority area. The report for Quarter 3 of 2020 is available at the following link: - the Quarter 4 report for 2020 will be published shortly.

The major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build social homes, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes, in addition to 800 acquisitions and 2,450 homes to be delivered through leasing programmes.

While Kildare County Council already has a social housing construction programme in train, I am keen that they are proactive in adding to this pipeline and, working with the Approved Housing Bodies, in advancing their existing projects as speedily as possible. The quarterly publication of the Social Housing Construction Status Report can also give Councillors and public representatives the opportunity to work with the local authority officials to press the advancement of these social housing delivery projects.</p></reply>

The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk.</p><p>Responsibility for management and maintenance of historical buildings and sites in State ownership and management of related visitor facilities, rests with the Office of Public Works (OPW) which also maintains a significant ongoing programme of conservation works. My Department will allocate funding to the OPW for the maintenance of certain historic buildings and sites over the course of the year as works begin to progress again. </p><p>With regard to the safeguarding of protected structures, Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 gives primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage by including particular structures on their respective Records of Protected Structures (RPS). Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with any development proposals affecting them.</p><p>My Department provides financial support, however, for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through two grant schemes which are, in the main, administered by the local authorities. These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF). Last year some 450 heritage projects across every county in the country were allocated funding from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under these schemes and an extra &euro;1m in funding was secured for built heritage projects under the July Jobs Stimulus Package 2020, which aimed to offset some of the effects of Covid-19. </p><p>The BHIS and HSF for 2021 were launched in November 2020, with a combined allocation of &euro;6m, an increase of nearly 40%. Due to Level 5 Covid-19 restriction the deadline for applications by local authorities, and direct applicants to the Department, has been extended to Friday 12 March 2021. Intending applicants are advised to contact their relevant local authority for details of local deadlines. Full details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on the website of each local authority. </p><p>My Department also announced a call for projects in September 2020 under the Community Monuments Fund (CMF) for investment in our archaeological heritage, which was being funded under the July Jobs Stimulus Package 2020. The CMF is prioritised for local authorities, private owners and custodians, and community groups for the care, maintenance, protection and promotion of local monuments and historic sites and the provision of any required measures to ensure safe access during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 38 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 4,000 more affordable homes.</p><p>Details of 35 SSF projects which received approval in principle under the two SSF calls are available on the Rebuilding Ireland's website as follows;</p><p>Call 1 </p><p>Call 2 </p><p>In addition to these projects, approval in principle has also been given to three further applications for SSF funding &ndash; details are provided in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Local       Authority</th>       <th>Name     of   Project</th>       <th>Number     of   affordable homes</th>       <th>SSF     Funding</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin     City   Council</td>       <td>Emmet     Road</td>       <td>375   &ndash;   all   Cost Rental</td>       <td>&euro;18.75m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin   City     Council</td>       <td>Oscar       Traynor Road</td>       <td>172   &ndash;     Affordable Purchase</td>       <td>&euro;8.7m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown   County Council</td>       <td>Shanganagh</td>       <td>397; 306 Cost Rental and   91 Affordable Purchase</td>       <td>&euro;19.85m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;47.3m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It is important to note that SSF is provided to support the cost of facilitating infrastructure which will lead to development of new affordable purchase and cost rental homes on local authority lands.  The timeframe for the delivery of such projects must accommodate detailed design, the consultation process, planning, procurement and construction. As with all large projects of this type, the nature and scale of the developments will generally evolve as plans are progressed by local authorities.</p><p>In making an application for SSF, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question and a viability to deliver homes with a reduction of at least 10% on open market values.</p><p>As you are aware, the Programme for Government has committed in outline to the development of a Town Centre First (TCF) policy. In accordance with this commitment, a TCF inter-Departmental Group (IDG) has now been established to consider the regeneration of our towns and villages.  Both my Department and the Department of Community and Rural Development have formulated this joint approach involving both the IDG and a wider Advisory Group of stakeholders, chaired by Minister of State Peter Burke, in advancing an initial scoping of the policy proposals. As part of this, measures and proposals to support more serviced sites closer to urban settlements such as towns and villages will be examined, within the broader context of the issues effecting such places as already outlined. It is anticipated that any recommendations forthcoming from the TCF approach will be developed over the coming months.</p><p>Consideration will also need to be given to the expansion of towns and villages in a sustainable manner.  Such development will be incremental, small scale, walkable (including to and from the town/village centre) and will occur on sites that have access adequate water supply and provision for disposal of domestic effluent.  Such extensions should also be guided by responsive design principles so that they appear as a natural extensions to the town/village with a close visual relationship to the prevailing vernacular.  My Department is addressing this in the context the development of proposed &lsquo;sustainable settlement guidance&rsquo;.</p></reply>

Most recently, on 6 October 2020, Ireland was one of 39 countries to support a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee which reiterates our grave concern regarding the situation in Xinjiang and recalls the exceptional letter of concern issued by 50 UN Special Procedures mandate holders, which called on China to respect human rights and allow, immediate, meaningful, and unfettered access to Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  Ireland also raised this matter during our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 25 September 2020, where we urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also previously supported a number of statements at the UN Human Rights Council, in June 2020 and July 2019, and at the UN Third Committee in October 2019. These statements, among other things, urged China to urgently implement the eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, and to uphold its international obligations and respect human rights in Xinjiang. They also called on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide regular information on the situation in the region, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed under international law. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s approach on the Security Council is informed by our record as a country with a consistent, principled and independent foreign policy. We put forward our perspectives on all issues on the Council agenda, and engage with all Council members, including China, while listening carefully to the views of other Council members.  </p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy. Although the treatment of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang is not on the Security Council agenda, the Government will continue to monitor and assess the situation and engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora to address our concerns.</p></reply>

The new UK controls will impact on exporters of all products of animal origin, including all meat, dairy, fish and composite products incorporating products of animal origin, as well as regulated plants and plant products.  These changes will also apply to such goods moving via the UK landbridge. In addition, from 1 April, the UK will no longer provide for the import from the EU of fresh meat preparations such as mincemeat and sausages, unless frozen.</p><p>These changes mean that, on top of the existing customs formalities, Irish exporters exporting to or through Great Britain, will need to comply with a number of new UK requirements from 1 April including pre-notification to the UK authorities and obtaining the appropriate Health Certificate(s) from the Irish authorities. The Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland means that no new checks and controls apply to trade between the EU, including Ireland, and Northern Ireland.</p><p>Departments and agencies have been in ongoing engagement with their UK counterparts to understand the BOM&rsquo;s requirement.  A major national communications campaign to make exporters aware of these additional Brexit-related changes is underway.  This is complemented by outreach by Ministers and more detailed stakeholder engagement by Departments and State Agencies.  Indeed, the new requirements was one of the topics discussed at the recent Brexit Stakeholders Forum which I chair.  A number of webinars for exporters are taking place throughout February and March 2021 including joint webinars from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Revenue Commissioners and webinars together with their UK counterparts (DEFRA, HMRC).  Sector-specific information and training are also being provided by Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Offices, Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</p><p>While I understand many businesses may still be working through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and earlier Brexit changes, it is crucial that exporters fully understand these new UK requirements.  Exporters must ensure everyone in the supply chain, including the importer and logistics provider, is clear on their roles and responsibilities and can meet them.  I would urge all exporters to avail of the range of Government supports that are available, including training and grants. Further information on these and other supports is set out at Gov.ie/Brexit.</p></reply>

We call for the results of the November 2020 democratic elections to be respected and the legitimate civilian Government restored.  </p>  <p>  The coup is a reversal of progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar that have taken years to establish, and does nothing to tackle the public health, security or economic issues faced by the people of Myanmar.</p>  <p>  Ireland deplores the killing of innocent civilians. The escalating use of force by the Myanmar military, the killing of protesters, the wounding of others and the use of live ammunition is totally unacceptable. We are deeply saddened by the deaths and critical injuries sustained by peaceful protesters. </p>  <p>  Ireland, the EU and UN, including the Security Council, have taken various steps to address the situation in Myanmar since February 1st. </p>  <p>  Ireland set out its concerns in a discussion at the UN Security Council on 2 February. The Security Council issued a Press Statement on 4 February reflecting the concerns of all 15 members. Given the events of the past weekend, the matter may come again to the Council in the coming days. </p>  <p>  An informal meeting of the General Assembly was convened on 26 February to hear a briefing from the Special Envoy on Myanmar and discuss developments. Ireland aligned with a strong and comprehensive EU statement at that session. </p>  <p>  Military rule opens significant scope for further human rights abuses in Myanmar and Ireland is voicing its concern at sessions of the Human Rights Council and we welcome the unanimous resolution agreed at the special session of the Human Rights Council on 12 February.   </p>  <p>  In my statement of 11 February I called for a firm response from the international community, including sanctions that target the perpetrators of the coup. On 22 February, EU Foreign Ministers agreed to devise targeted sanctions on the leaders of the coup. In taking such decisions, Ireland is committed to ensuring that any course of action is appropriate, works to restore the democratic path in Myanmar and does not negatively affect developmental gains or exacerbate the humanitarian situation in Myanmar. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work with our partners in the EU, with other members of the UN Security Council and with countries in the region to ensure an effective, appropriate, and sustainable outcome to this crisis.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to ensuring that the UN is capable of continuous reform to adapt to emerging as well as to traditional global challenges such as preventing conflict and defending human rights. Ireland&rsquo;s financial contributions across a number of UN organisations are an essential part of our engagement on human rights, and not least our contribution to the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (&euro;1.865 million in 2020).  </p>  <p>In my address at the current Human Rights Council session on 24th   February, I reiterated that &ldquo;Ireland is a long standing champion of civic space, in Geneva, in New York and in communities worldwide&rdquo;, and that, &ldquo;we remain gravely concerned by the unacceptable pressures being experienced by civil society around the world, including human rights defenders, LGBTI defenders, journalists and media workers&rdquo;. I highlighted the unacceptable detention of human rights defenders in Myanmar and Belarus, while also underlining our concerns around human rights concerns in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; Syria; Yemen and Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs works closely with the UN Treaty Bodies and also with the UN Special Rapporteurs including the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, Ms Mary Lawlor who presents her report to the Council on the 4th March. Ireland strongly supports the work of the EU Special Representative on Human Rights, former T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore, and we work closely with the EU to strengthen UN human rights resolutions and procedures to protect human rights defenders across the globe.</p>  <p>  In conclusion I wish to assure the Deputy that the protection of Human Rights Defenders remains a key priority for the Government. Furthermore, once current restrictions are relaxed, I invite him to visit the memorial to global human rights defenders which I had the privilege to unveil with Front Line Defenders in the grounds of Iveagh House in December of last year.</p></reply>

The Court was established in 2002 with the entry into force of the Rome Statute.  By its very existence, the Court promotes and upholds not only the rule of law but also provides a means to bring to account the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. In this way it contributes in a most fundamental way to the cause of international peace and justice.</p><p>While the ICC is central to the overall framework for international criminal justice, it is a court of last resort. The ICC does not substitute for national judicial systems. States bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes. </p><p>Referrals to the International Criminal Court may only be made with respect to crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court namely: the crime of aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  The Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction is limited to the territory or nationals of States Parties to the Rome Statute or States that have accepted the Court&rsquo;s jurisdiction on an ad hoc basis and situations referred to it by the Security Council of the United Nations. This jurisdiction must be triggered in one of three ways: a situation may be referred to the Court by a State Party to the Rome Statute; a situation may be referred to the Court by the United Nations Security Council; or the Prosecutor may initiate a <i>propio motu</i>investigation into crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court (an investigation on the Prosecutor&rsquo;s own initiative). Referrals by the United Nations Security Council are pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, and must receive nine affirmative votes at the Council without one of the five permanent Council Members (P5) vetoing the referral.  </p><p>The Office of the Prosecutor is currently engaged in 13 investigations and 14 preliminary examinations across 25 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. As a result of the Prosecutor&rsquo;s investigations, there are currently 20 cases against 25 individuals active before the International Criminal Court.</p><p>Ireland, together with its EU partners has been, and continues to be, a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court. Furthermore, ensuring accountability is one of the key principles underpinning our engagement on the United Nations Security Council. We will support and defend the Court throughout our two-year term on the Council, which started on 1 January 2021.</p></reply>

Over six years of conflict have left over 24 million in need of humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply concerned at the ongoing conduct of this conflict. I spoke this morning with the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, about the situation.  There have been numerous reports of acts which are contrary to international law, including damage and destruction to civilian infrastructure, targeting of journalists, mistreatment of prisoners, the recruitment of child soldiers, and conflict-related sexual violence. </p>  <p>  International humanitarian law is clear; parties to a conflict are obliged to do everything possible to protect civilians. Ireland has consistently called on all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law.</p>  <p>  At the UN Human Rights Council in 2017, Ireland was part of a core group of countries that drove forward the adoption of a Resolution establishing a UN Group of Eminent Experts (GEE) to carry out investigations into alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict in Yemen. The most recent report of the GEE highlights a consistent record of violations of IHL and human rights law. </p>  <p>  On 25 February 2021, Ireland supported Resolution 2564 at the UN Security Council which reaffirmed the need to ensure accountability for violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports all efforts towards a sustained end to the conflict in Yemen. We call on all parties to the conflict to enact an immediate cessation of hostilities, and engage seriously in the UN led political process.</p></reply>

The conflict has had a devastating impact on the population of Tigray, and poses severe risks to the stability of the wider Horn of Africa region. </p>  <p>  Since the outbreak of hostilities in Tigray, there have been allegations of war crimes and of crimes against humanity. Ireland strongly support calls by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for independent, impartial, thorough and transparent investigations into these allegations, to ensure accountability and, where appropriate, justice.</p>  <p>  On 26th February, Amnesty International reported that hundreds of unarmed civilians were massacred in Axum last November and that these crimes were perpetrated mainly by Eritrean troops. Ireland supports the EU&rsquo;s call for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Ethiopia, whose presence remains a barrier to humanitarian access and is linked to these and other alleged atrocities. </p>  <p>  Ireland raised the Tigray situation at the UN Security Council on 3 February and again today, 4 March, expressing deep concern at the humanitarian situation in Tigray and calling for unhindered humanitarian access. Ireland also called on all parties in Tigray to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law including those related to the protection of civilians and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for an urgent response to the humanitarian situation, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict through bilateral engagement, our EU membership and also at the UN Security Council, where we remain actively engaged with other Council members on further ways to address the crisis. Minister Coveney continues to raise these issues with key interlocuters, including with his counterparts in the region. He has condemned reported atrocities and identity-based attacks, and has called for the human rights of all Ethiopians to be upheld. </p>  <p>  My Department, through Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;2.6 million to date to support the humanitarian response to the Tigray crisis. This includes &euro;1.4 million to Irish NGOs within Tigray, &euro;500,000 to the UN refugee agency to support the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, and almost &euro;750,000 towards humanitarian stocks, and supports for the protection of women and girls. </p></reply>

It is the most significant driver of humanitarian crises. The number and complexity of these crises globally has increased in recent years, as evidenced by a UN estimate that a record 239 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and protection. Each conflict is unique in its character, scale and complexity, and as such cannot be ranked by any single set of criteria of severity. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong contributor to global efforts to avoid and resolve conflict, prevent genocide, and eliminate the abuse of women and children and all vulnerable groups. Central to this is our strong and enduring commitment to effective multilateralism, particularly through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations. </p>  <p>  The EU, through implementation of its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), works globally to support the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of international security. Ireland is an active participant in and contributor to CFSP implementation and in supporting EU and UN efforts to address the root causes of conflict.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has a long tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts. Ireland has maintained a continuous presence in UN peace support operations since 1958, and has more than 570 personnel in United Nations mandated missions overseas.  The Government is committed to participation in peacekeeping operations as a tangible contribution to the development of global peace and security.  </p>  <p>  Accountability, including for crimes against humanity, is important not only as a means of pursuing justice for victims, but also as a crucial component to create stability and peace in post-conflict situations. A strong international criminal justice system is central to fighting impunity. While states bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes, Ireland regards the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of such a system. Ireland, together with its EU partners is a consistent and strong supporter of the Court. We will also support and defend the Court throughout our term on the United Nations Security Council, where ensuring accountability is one of the key principles underpinning our engagement.</p></reply>

There are currently 12 UN peacekeeping operations worldwide, with over 95,000 uniformed personnel from over 120 countries. It is a global effort to which Ireland is fully committed- with contributions from the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Ireland is present in more than half of the current UN peacekeeping operations.</p>  <p>  UN peacekeepers are increasingly deployed to complex and volatile environments, making it vital that peacekeeping operations are designed to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and focus on the protection of civilians. To this end, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres launched a peacekeeping reform initiative in 2018, known as Action for Peacekeeping. It aims to refocus peacekeeping with more targeted mandates, stronger operations, mobilised support for political solutions, and better-equipped and trained forces to strengthen protection of civilians.</p>  <p>  Ireland is fully supportive of this initiative. During our time on the Security Council, Ireland will work to ensure that the mandates for peacekeeping missions align with the needs of the people they seek to protect, and that the missions have the resources necessary to carry out their tasks. </p></reply>

We have always been, and will remain, a strong supporter of enlargement of the European Union, provided that candidate countries meet the necessary conditions for membership. In this regard, we welcome the reform agenda underway in the countries of the Western Balkans and the progress that has been made in the areas of security and rule of law.</p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring the progress individual countries in the Western Balkans are making towards meeting the criteria for EU accession, Ireland&rsquo;s embassies accredited to the Western Balkans continue to keep track of each country&rsquo;s progress and interact closely with the EU Delegations based there who provide annual comprehensive reports on the reforms within each country.</p>  <p>  The European Commission published its latest Annual Enlargement Package and country reports in October 2020. In terms of the progress of individual Western Balkan countries, Serbia and Montenegro are both currently negotiating Chapters of the Acquis with the EU. Serbia has opened negotiations on 18 Chapters, with two provisionally closed. Montenegro has opened all Chapters and provisionally closed three. The country reports for 2020 assessed both Serbia and Montenegro as having both made limited progress. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms, particularly in the areas of rule of law and justice, and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo, while Montenegro must address shortcomings in the areas of media freedom, fight against corruption and trafficking, and turn its attention to the closing of Chapters.</p>  <p>  Regarding North Macedonia and Albania, it was agreed by the European Council in March 2020 to open negotiations with both countries. It was regrettable that Member States were unable to reach agreement on the draft negotiating frameworks for both countries at the November General Affairs Council. Ireland believes the draft negotiating frameworks should be agreed at the earliest available opportunity to allow the first Intergovernmental Conferences to take place with both countries.</p>  <p>  Bosnia-Herzegovina has made limited progress over the last year and faces significant challenges to ensure implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s 2019 recommendations in the areas of democracy, rule of law, fundamental rights, and public administration reform. Progress in these areas must be seen before the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered.</p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for Membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2020 noted that the political situation in Kosovo remains challenging. Rule of law, judicial reform, public administration reform, organised crime and normalisation of the relationship with Serbia are just some of the areas that must be comprehensively addressed in order for Kosovo to advance on its European path. It will be some time before Kosovo can qualify as a candidate country.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

Ireland supports the EU, UN and other international efforts to reduce the influence of Boko Haram and Al Shabaab and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians. Ireland continues to monitor the activities of these groups and to assist populations affected by their actions.</p><p>Through Irish Aid, the Government's official aid programme, Ireland is tackling poverty, hunger and exclusion which can be a driver of support for groups such as Boko Haram and Al Shabaab, as well as responding to humanitarian need in regions affected by conflict. This includes &euro;27 million in humanitarian funding to the Lake Chad region since 2015, and also funding for those displaced by conflict in North-East Nigeria. Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;51.6 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia, including to communities displaced by conflict in Al Shabaab-held areas.  With humanitarian needs in these regions likely to remain acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p><p>The UN is active in the Lake Chad Basin areas affected by Boko Haram, through its Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission. Ireland is penholder together with Niger on the UNOWAS file at the UN Security Council, working to ensure that UNOWAS has a clear strategic direction in its work on conflict prevention and peacebuilding in West Africa. In its Presidential Statement on peace consolidation in West Africa of 3 February, the Security Council condemned attacks against civilians in Borno State on 28 November 2020, and the abduction of schoolchildren in Katsina state, claimed by Boko Haram.</p><p>The UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat Al Shabaab.  Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council.  That Committee oversees an arms embargo and other tools to encourage a more peaceful and secure Somalia, including engagement with Al Shabaab.  This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting Somalia, including the strengthening of its government institutions.  The EU provides significant development funding to Somalia, and to countries affected by Boko Haram. Ireland is a members of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and has observer status at the Sahel Alliance:  both are forum which enable donors to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin.  </p><p>The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to EUCAP Somalia, including the current Head of Mission. In the Sahel,<i></i>Ireland currently has 19 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali. Ireland also deploys one expert to the EUCAP Sahel Niger. 14 Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows us to contribute to peace and security across the Sahel, help protect human rights, and put in place conditions for its sustainable development.</p></reply>

The cessation of hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan remains intact under the November 2020 agreement. This is welcome, but important issues have yet to be addressed, including the full exchange of Prisoners of War, the removal from the region of foreign fighters, and the issue of the final status of Nagorno-Karabakh. Work to restore economic and transport ties in the region is ongoing and will be an important part of any foundation for regional peace. </p>  <p>  Access to the region remains a challenge for the international community. In December, the UN Secretary General stated that the UN is prepared to provide humanitarian assistance and we reiterate our call for all sides to allow access to UN bodies. The EU increased its contribution to humanitarian aid for the region in February by an additional &euro;3 million, bringing the total contribution since the conflict began to &euro;6.9 million. Ireland remains a strong supporter and contributor of funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which remains the major international humanitarian organisation present throughout the region. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support renewed efforts towards a negotiated, comprehensive and sustainable settlement of the conflict, particularly on the long-term status of Nagorno-Karabakh. We believe the OSCE Minsk Group is the appropriate format through which to achieve this objective. The EU stands ready to contribute to the intensification of negotiations in this format. The EU, OSCE and the Council of Europe can also play important roles in post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation efforts through confidence building measures.</p></reply>

This will allow Ireland to maintain its longstanding focus on meeting the needs of people furthest behind, such as those affected by food insecurity and conflict. It also allows for a continued emphasis on helping people cope with the impact of Covid-19 and a deepening of the Irish Aid response to climate change, targeted at those most in need.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that our resources reach those in greatest need is central to our work and our ability to do so is well-recognised. In 2020, for example, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) highlighted Ireland as "an excellent humanitarian partner", with its funding models a "useful inspiration for other DAC donors", while respected international think-tank ODI found Ireland to be the most principled donor in its index, the second successive year in which Ireland scored highest.</p>  <p>Ireland's ODA is delivered through multilateral organisations such as the UN, funding to Irish civil society organisations, as well as bilateral ODA spent through Irish Embassies abroad. Our funding is complemented by Ireland's political and diplomatic engagement, including now as a member of the UN Security Council. These complementary channels ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is directed to where it is needed most, in the most appropriate and effective way.  </p></reply>

For almost nine weeks now, the UK has been outside the EU Single Market and Customs Union and the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) has applied to our trade and cooperation with the UK. The Government has been assisting businesses as they adapt to the new trading environment, including the new requirements concerning customs and SPS checks and controls. While some businesses have experienced specific issues, more than 80% of the trucks landing in our ports from the UK are now being &lsquo;green routed&rsquo; to leave our ports directly having correctly completed the required customs formalities prior to arriving.  </p>  <p>  Government Departments, including my own, continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders, whether business representative groups, retailers and individual businesses or shipping companies, hauliers and logistics companies, to manage the issues arising from the new trading relationship with the UK.  A range of Government supports, including training and grants, are in place to assist businesses in dealing with these changes.  This includes the Ready for Customs Grant of up to &euro;9,000 per eligible employee hired, or redeployed within the business, to a dedicated customs role.  Further information on these and other supports is set out at Gov.ie/Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government is also monitoring a number of issues in relation to the implementation and outworking of the TCA, including its provisions in relation to fisheries and Rules of Origin, and will continue to provide guidance and assistance on these matters.  Given the expected impact of Brexit on our fisheries sector, the Government has been engaging with EU partners, with the fisheries sector and coastal communities regarding possible mitigation measures.</p>  <p>  A strong stakeholder engagement and communications programme continues to be a key element of our Brexit response, particularly in light of the new UK checks from 1 April.  These engagements provide a valuable platform to engage with sectors impacted by the post transition trading environment. This includes regular meetings with the hauliers and ferry companies (D/Transport) and regular engagement at the Retail Forum (D/ETE), Enterprise Forum (D/ETE), Brexit Stakeholder Consultative Committee (D/AFM), Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Consultative Committee and the Brexit Stakeholder Forum (D/FA), which I chair.</p>  <p>  We and our EU partners also continue to engage with stakeholders on the island of Ireland, including in relation to the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland.  The Protocol is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect vital all-island supply chains, and to ensure the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  Commission Vice President, Maros Sefcovic, engaged with stakeholders North and South on the week of 15 February.</p>  <p>  With the new UK checks coming into effect on certain EU imports from 1 April, the Government&rsquo;s preparedness message is being recalibrated towards exporters, particularly those moving food and other agri-products.  In addition to a nationwide advertising campaign across all platforms: print, radio and digital advertising, a number of webinars for exporters are taking place throughout February and March 2021 including joint webinars from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Revenue Commissioners and webinars together with their UK counterparts (DEFRA, HMRC).  Sector-specific information and training are also being provided by Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Offices, Bord Bia and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Further information on the steps they need to take and on the supports available are provided on Gov.ie/Brexit.</p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.</p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response. It has the authority to draw together, in a joint manner, the contribution of all of the elements of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, Reserve, etc. This was provided for in a Defence Forces Regulation signed by and under the authority of the Minister for Defence.</p><p>The Defence Forces Joint Task Force is based in McKee Barracks and its priority from the beginning has been to provide support to the HSE, while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.  The wide range of supports that the Defence Forces have provided to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force during the COVID-19 crisis include:</p><p>- operation of the COVID-19 testing centre at the Aviva stadium; </p><p>- support for contact tracing efforts;</p><p>- transportation by the Air Corps of COVID-19 tests to Germany;</p><p>- collection of PPE from more than 260 cargo flights and the ongoing storage and distribution of this PPE to various HSE sites;</p><p>- support for HSE testing efforts including through deployment of Naval Service vessels to Dublin, Cork and Galway; </p><p>- PPE training to workers at Cork and Waterford harbours by Naval service personnel;</p><p>- provision of tentage and marshalling support at various HSE testing sites around the country;</p><p>- transportation of patients for testing;</p><p>- a range of non clinical and administrative supports in a number of residential care home facilities; </p><p>- assistance with the fit out of temporary facilities for the HSE (for example, the HSE facilities at City West and the University of Limerick);</p><p>- production and assembly of PPE using 3D printing facilities; and</p><p>- the use of lands at Ballymullen Barracks as a COVID-19 testing facility and contact tracing hub.</p><p>In addition to supporting the HSE, the Defence Forces have also provided a broad range of supports to other Departments and Agencies.  Provision of this support was also coordinated by the Joint Task Force.  Examples include: </p><p>- Support has been provided to the National Ambulance Service through Defence Forces ambulance and crew supports along with tele-triage supports.</p><p>- Support to the Office of Government Procurement through assistance with storage and distribution of PPE.</p><p>- Support to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through the use of lands at Sarsfields Barracks for the location of one of the National Temporary Body Storage Facilities. The Defence Forces were also on standby to provide support if required at the Dublin based National Temporary Body Storage Facility at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.</p><p>With regard to the specific enquiry raised by the Deputy, the Defence Forces Joint Task Force received no requests through the HSE from CHO 8 for Defence Forces assistance in residential care facilities during April 2020.  </p><p>In supporting the national effort in countering Covid 19, the Defence Forces provided assistance to the HSE and the National Ambulance Service in conducting a significant number of Covid 19 tests within residential care facilities during April 2020.</p></reply>

A detailed analysis of school enrolment data and the latest data available from Census 2016, using the HP Deprivation Index, was carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group. This group contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. This group commenced a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the technical aspects and implementation of the model and are concluding work on some final elements of the model. It is envisaged that this will then provide the basis for development of a DEIS resource allocation system to match resources to identified need. Until this work is complete, I do not envisage that there will be any changes to the HSCL allocation to DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  However, in light of the need to support students who have missed on learning opportunities as a result of Covid-19 school closures, it is vital that DEIS schools catering for those students from poorer socio-economic backgrounds receive continued support. Hence I have targeted the funding available where it can best support those in need. </p>  <p>  As part of the Budget 2021 measures to tackle educational disadvantage, on 1st March 2021 I announced a one-point reduction in the staffing schedule to reduce class-size in all DEIS Urban Band 1 primary schools. Additionally to support attendance and participation of vulnerable learners and those at risk of education disadvantage in DEIS schools, I provided a 5% increase in funding for the School Completion Programme. </p></reply>

It involves an educational programme to enhance overall development, help prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage. Parental involvement is one of the core elements of the programme in recognition of the parent/guardian as the prime educator of the child and to encourage the parent/guardian to become involved in his/her child's education.</p>  <p>  Since the inception of Early Start, the early childhood education and care landscape has changed significantly with the introduction of the ECCE scheme in 2010, and the extension of the scheme to two years in 2018.  The ECCE scheme is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and officials of my Department and its agencies co-operate closely with that Department, particularly in relation to S&iacute;olta and Aistear, the national quality and curriculum frameworks for early years care and education.</p>  <p>  While the ECCE scheme is the national universal two-year pre-school programme available to all children, the Early Start programme continues to run in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage, and in the 2020/21 school year there are 905 children enrolled.</p></reply>

This class of social insurance gives contributors access to a limited range of social insurance benefits such as carer&rsquo;s benefit, guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), occupational injury benefit, parents&rsquo; benefit and widow&rsquo;s, widowers or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory)  pension.  It does not give entitlement to the State pension (contributory).  </p>  <p>  As social insurance contributions are made in accordance with the legislation in force at the time they  are made, there is no provision to retrospectively convert the class of social insurance to another class of social insurance or to facilitate contributors making additional payments in order to establish an entitlement to the State pension (contributory).  </p>  <p>  Persons under the pensionable age of 66 who cease to be covered by compulsory social insurance either as an employee or as a self-employed person may opt to become insured on a voluntary basis and pay voluntary contributions provided certain contribution conditions are satisfied.  The class of voluntary contributions that applies is based on the last class of compulsory social insurance paid prior to becoming a voluntary contributor.

The representatives outlined a range of issues that are causing concern within their schemes.   </p>  <p>  One of the issues raised by CE sponsors was the implications of an interpterion of a 2017 rule change that affected CE participants aged 55 years and older who were on CE in July 2017.  Following an examination by Departmental officials, I wish to confirm that those CE participants who were impacted by that rule change in July 2017, now have the option of remaining on CE for a maximum of six consecutive years, in accordance with the terms of the 2017 saver clause. </p>  <p>  This provision may also apply to a number of former CE participants who finished up on CE during 2020 and moved to jobseekers allowance.   Each case will be reviewed in line with the terms of the 2017 saver clause and Department staff will work with CE sponsoring authorities to identify eligible CE participants. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department has introduced a number of contingency measures, including the extension of CE participant contracts that were due to finish during Level-5 periods of public health restrictions.  The current contract end date has recently been extended further until 2nd July, 2021.    These latest extensions is of direct benefit to approximately 7,000 of  employment support scheme participants whose contracts were due to end since last October.  These extensions also directly benefited the cohort  CE participants mentioned in the question by the Deputy.  Under the terms of these contract extensions, in place since last October,  CE participants did not exit schemes and should not therefore have moved onto jobseekers payments. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p></reply>

It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay redundancy payments to all eligible employees at this minimum rate as provided for under the Act.  Policy responsibility for the schemes transferred to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 14th October 2020.  While employers are required to notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the potential for collective redundancies, employers are not required to submit a notification of actual redundancies that have occurred. As a consequence, there is no central record of redundancies each year and consequently no potential to identify levels of PRSI paid by these employers into the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).</p><p>Under the Redundancy Payment Scheme, it is only where an employer is unable to pay statutory redundancy due to financial difficulties that an application may be submitted to the Department of Social Protection for the payment of statutory redundancy entitlements from the SIF.  Details of the number of applications received since 2010 and the associated costs under the Redundancy Payments Scheme is shown below. </p><p>When a redundancy payment is made from the SIF, the employer is notified of the amount owed and a debt is recorded for recovery from the employer as provided for under Sections 32 and 43 of the Redundancy Payments Act.  A recovery plan takes into account the current financial situation of the employer and their capacity to repay the outstanding debt with each case dealt with on its own merits.  This includes agreeing arrangements whereby the debt can be recovered by way of instalments over a period of time. The Department of Social Protection has not commenced any enforcement action, nor attempted to take possession of any family home as part of in order to recover outstanding debts to the Social Insurance Fund as a result of payments made under the Redundancy Payments Scheme.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Applications received under the Redundancy Payments Scheme</th>       <th>Redundancy Payments Scheme Expenditure</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010</td>       <td>58,731</td>       <td>&euro;40.86m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>49,762</td>       <td>&euro;41.48m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>33,072</td>       <td>&euro;134.32m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>14,088</td>       <td>&euro;76.59m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>6,883</td>       <td>&euro;58.51m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>4,333</td>       <td>&euro;32.76m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>4,372</td>       <td>&euro;30.99m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>3,056</td>       <td>&euro;23.49m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2,845</td>       <td>&euro;18.91m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2,446</td>       <td>&euro;26.82m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>4,157</td>       <td>&euro;37.1m* *Estimated Expenditure. 2020 Account not finalised </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Note: Applications received from 2010-2013 include applications under the rebate scheme which was discontinued in 2013.

For example, if a person paid social insurance at Class A in their last employment and is eligible for credits, they will protect the person's entitlement to Class A social insurance benefits.

It is intended to support early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services that are very reliant on parental fees to remain sustainable during the period of high level Covid-19 restrictions, while meeting the condition of not charging fees for families whose children are not attending the service during this period of restricted opening. It is not intended to replace foregone parental fees. </p>  <p>  Given the very short time-period for which it will apply, the COSP was designed to support ease of administration, with a very simple application process. Eligibility for the COSP was determined on the basis of transparent, objective criteria, which were selected on the basis that they were likely to identify those services that are most reliant on parental fees.</p>  <p>  The criteria reflect the continued availability of the enhanced Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) rates (which are estimated to meet 80% of payroll costs or 50% of operating costs), up to 100% continued funding of schemes operated by my Department, and receipt of parental fees for children attending services that are open. Closed services have reduced operating costs.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that some services that are reliant on parental fees may not meet the criteria &ndash; it is open to such services to apply for sustainability funding if the service has sustainability concerns as a result of the current restrictions. On 26 February my Department announced the details of the Covid-19 Impact Support, which will be available throughout 2021 for eligible ELC and SAC services that require further financial assistance in addition to current support measures available and others that may be announced throughout the year. The application process for COVID-19 Impact Support began on Monday 1 March.</p></reply>

The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme.

This includes the consideration of issues around work placements for students. The national co-ordination group for further and higher education is also meeting on a regular basis, and is closely monitoring the impact that Covid-19 is having on third level institutions and their students.</p>  <p>  The government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business and Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021, Plan for Living with COVID-19, combined with the HSA Return to Work Protocols and ongoing Public Health advice, provide the over-arching framework for all sectors of society for the operation of their facilities and premises in keeping with public health advice.</p>  <p>  Specific to further and higher education, the government has also published &ldquo;Guidance for Further and Higher Education for returning to on-site activity in 2020: Roadmap and COVID-19 Adaptation Framework for returning to on-site activity in autumn 2020&rdquo; accompanied by &ldquo;Implementation Guidelines for Public Health Measures in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)&rdquo; and outbreaks protocols developed in collaboration with experts within the higher education sector and with the Department of Health. This suite of guidance provides robust advice to higher and further educational facilities on COVID-19 prevention measures, implementation of which will minimise the risk of infection for all students and staff. Further and Higher Education Institutes should adapt and customise these recommendations for their own particular settings, adhering at all times to the overarching Public Health principles on which the guidance is predicated.</p>  <p>  Level 5 measures designate higher and further education as essential insofar as onsite presence is required and such education activities cannot be held remotely. The priority activities which can continue - subject to the appropriate protective measures, guidelines and local assessment- include practical tuition, workshops and skills-based learning (including in relation to apprenticeships) and engagement with vulnerable learners.  Local assessment will focus on activities that are not capable of being delivered through alternative means, and are time-critical for students and learners during this period. </p>  <p>  As Higher Education Institutions are autonomous, and as such are academically independent and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes, including in relation to placement arrangements, and as there are a wide range of courses with work placement options, students are encouraged to approach their institutions directly if they have any queries in relation to their work placements. Reflecting the scale and diversity of third-level provision, higher education institution themselves are best equipped to determine where onsite presence is required. </p></reply>

Craft apprenticeships consist of seven phases of training, three of which are off-the-job and delivered by Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities across the country. </p>  <p>  Start and end dates for an apprenticeship are defined respectively by the date the apprentice is registered with SOLAS and when a Results Approval Panel confirms to SOLAS that an apprentice has successfully met the required standard by completion of all on and off the job elements of their apprenticeship. For craft apprentices, this process is generally completed by 208 weeks, while noting that this may not always be the case. For example there could be a delay in either the on or off the job elements for a variety of reasons.  </p>  <p>  The impacts of COVID-19 closures have had a significant impact on craft apprenticeship off the job training.  When permissible, on-site practical training is operating at approximately 50% normal capacity to ensure adherence to public health guidance. The Government have allocated additional funding for 2021 to fund 2,000 apprenticeship places required to catch up on the lost provision in 2020 and to mitigate against the effect of smaller apprenticeship class sizes.</p>  <p>  To date, SOLAS designed and implemented an alternative assessment strategy for approximately 2,100 craft apprentices in June 2020 to address immediate continuity of training and assessments issues at that time.  Since January 11th training facilities have again been closed however theoretical training aspects of the craft apprenticeship courses have been delivered online for apprentices who are due to attend off-the-job training during this period. Intensive work is underway to agree a phased basis return to onsite training for apprentices who have had their training interrupted or who were close to assessment before the January shutdown. The onsite training and assessment is now time critical and apprenticeship stakeholders are working on this plan as a priority. </p>  <p>  In addition to the urgent work on returning apprentices to onsite training, SOLAS and the HEA are exploring the development of additional training capacity across education and training providers with the objective of tackling the waiting lists and ensuring that apprentices complete their training as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each higher and further education provider to determine which individual students should be prioritised to receive a device, on a needs basis and within the terms and conditions of the grant. </p>  <p>  Students, including mature students, who consider they may be eligible to apply for a device should contact the relevant HEI or ETB for further information.   </p></reply>

A provision of &euro;11.27 million has been made for GSOC in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  I am informed that GSOC is currently putting in place a comprehensive Learning and Development (L&amp;D) Strategy to identify its key learning and development needs, including the need for appropriate accreditation and continuous professional development, for all its staff.  This is a particular imperative for GSOC in light of new personnel joining the organisation, advances in investigative techniques, the increasing complexity of the policing environment in Ireland and the nature and range of functions envisaged for GSOC under the Government&rsquo;s programme for policing reform arising from the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to determine the cost of the required training programme in advance of a detailed specification of requirements being completed by GSOC. Nevertheless, it is clear that the cost will be substantial, given that an extensive programme is required to be designed, procured and delivered over the period 2021-23 and for the ongoing provision of training and continuous professional development thereafter.  When GSOC was first established in 2007, UK services were used to provide appropriate training for its investigators. </p>  <p>It is essential to ensure that GSOC&rsquo;s staff have the appropriate skills, knowledge and expertise commensurate with carrying out their statutory oversight functions in accordance with best practice, and my Department will continue to engage with GSOC with regard to their training needs.  </p></reply>

I have no role or function in the processing or management of complaints which are made to GSOC for investigation.</p>  <p>  GSOC&rsquo;s main area of responsibility is to deal with complaints concerning Garda conduct.  While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, provides for time limits for the making of complaints, such time limits may be extended where there is good reason.  It is also the case that GSOC may investigate matters in relation to the conduct of Garda&iacute;, when it is in the public interest.  I am advised that there is nothing therefore to prohibit GSOC engaging with legacy cases where appropriate to do so.   Furthermore, the organisation of the work of GSOC is a matter for the Commission.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is a difficult and complex task.  The Stormont House Agreement sets out a comprehensive set of measures to deal with legacy issues in a way that can meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors and support closure and reconciliation for those communities most affected by the Troubles. </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the implementation of those measures and we will continue to work with the Government of the United Kingdom and the parties in Northern Ireland to give effect to them. </p></reply>

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these decisions.  </p>  <p>  Community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006).  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country. Decisions in relation to the introduction or extension of Garda CCTV systems are matters for the Garda Commissioner and not for me as Minister. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that CCTV applications are processed and reviewed by the Garda National Community Engagement Bureau prior to their consideration by the CCTV advisory Committee and a recommendation being made to the Garda Commissioner as to their suitability for authorisation. Due to the varied nature and size of applications, it is not possible to give a generic timeframe on processing an application as all applications are different.</p>  <p>  In general, delays in processing applications are mainly caused by applications which are incorrectly made, or applications missing required information. Applications received with errors or omissions cannot be considered for approval, and must be returned to the applicant to be rectified, resulting in additional delays.</p></reply>

This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources are made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.</p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2019. At the end of January 2021 there were 4,634 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,437 in January 2019.</p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of Covid-19, as well as to address waiting lists.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are continuously reviewing waiting lists with a view to ensuring that services for scheduled care are resumed as soon as it is deemed safe to do so in line with HSE clinical guidelines.</p><p>The attached document shows the number of persons on the outpatient and inpatient &amp;amp; daycase (IPDC) waiting lists for ophthalmology from 2016 through to January 2021.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department and further information is available here: .</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first. </p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. </p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link:</p><p>The ongoing review process will continue to look at the other priority groups yet to be vaccinated, along with the competing needs of those working or living in high-risk situations, carers who deliver essential services to highly dependent individuals in the home setting, and those who are socially vulnerable/disadvantaged.</p></reply>

The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be overstated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19th November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. </p><p>Data indicates that 155 nursing homes are actively dealing with a COVID-19 Outbreak. We continue to see new outbreaks being notified with on average, approximately one new outbreak per day being notified in the week up to 27<sup>th</sup>February. Noting that on 27<sup>th</sup>February approx. 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, the level of risk, including to residents of nursing homes remains high. The public health advice remains clear as noted  in the statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team on 24<sup>th</sup>February &ldquo;<i>Given the increased transmissibility of the virus now, we must continue to limit our social contacts and do all we can to starve this disease of opportunities to spread</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  </p><p>I recently wrote to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the importance of adopting a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the important role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing. The importance of ensuring that visits take place to the greatest extent possible, in line with public health guidance and risk assessments was reiterated and providers were encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone to calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead, published on 23<sup>rd</sup>February, recognises that the challenge of balancing protective health measures and normal living has been particularly important in the context of visitations to long-term residential care settings (LTRC). LTRC visiting guidance has remained under ongoing review throughout the pandemic. </p><p>In light of the advanced stage of rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in LTRCs for both residents and staff, the NPHET (the National Public Health Emergency Team) has requested that the HSE progress a process for considering the scope and application of LTRC visiting restrictions in the context of the Framework of Restrictive Measures, having regard to international and national evidence, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and the level of disease in the community. The HSE has commenced this process. </p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department and further information is available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/39038-provisional-vaccine-allocation-groups/.</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first. </p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. </p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/b44b2-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-vaccine-allocation-strategy/.</p><p>The ongoing review process will continue to look at the other priority groups yet to be vaccinated, along with the competing needs of those working or living in high-risk situations, carers who deliver essential services to highly dependent individuals in the home setting, and those who are socially vulnerable/disadvantaged.</p></reply>

A feature of those schemes was that it was not necessary to prove negligence or breach of duty for compensatory damage. Mr. Justice Meenan advised that such a scheme was not appropriate for CervicalCheck cases given the issues of liability involved. Accordingly, the format for the CervicalCheck Tribunal which gives effect to Mr. Justice Meenan&rsquo;s recommendations recognises the issues of liability involved in CervicalCheck cases and allows them to be determined by the Tribunal.</p><p>Mr. Justice Meenan&rsquo;s recommendations were accepted and have been implemented with the establishment of the CervicalCheck Tribunal on 27 October 2020, under the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019. Following a pause in the steps towards full establishment to allow for discussions with the 221+ Patient Representative Group about the Tribunal and CervicalCheck Cases generally, establishment of the Tribunal was finalised with the appointment of the nominated members to the Tribunal with effect from 1 December 2020. </p><p>The Tribunal remains the most appropriate venue to hear and determine CervicalCheck claims. It has been specifically designed for that purpose. It is, of course, entirely up to eligible women as to whether or not they use it.</p><p><b>The CervicalCheck Ex-Gratia Scheme</b> In his report on an alternative system for dealing with claims arising from CervicalCheck, Mr. Justice Meenan recognised that the issues of liability on non-disclosure may legally be of a &lsquo;less contentious nature&rsquo; and that any liability for non-disclosure appeared to rest with the State, having no involvement of third parties i.e. the laboratories.</p><p>Judge Meenan recommended that in cases where liability is not being contested, e.g. in claims relating solely to non-disclosure, such claims should be &ldquo;fast tracked&rdquo; through the statutory Tribunal which he proposed. </p><p>Following consideration of Judge Meenan&rsquo;s report, the Government recognised that setting up and establishing a statutory Tribunal would take some time and proposed an alternative process that would facilitate the women affected in addressing the non-disclosure issue without delay. On 11 March 2019 the Government agreed to the establishment of an ex-gratia scheme for those affected by the non-disclosure of the CervicalCheck audit. The Scheme is designed to provide an alternative, non-adversarial and person-centred option for those affected by the CervicalCheck non-disclosure issue. </p><p>The Independent Assessment Panel, chaired by Justice Aindrias &Oacute; Caoimh, has determined that &euro;20,000 is the appropriate amount for the ex gratia payment. All women, or their next of kin, in the 221-cohort identified from the clinical audit as having discordance in their smear test result are eligible to participate in the Scheme. </p><p>To date, 170 applications have been received and payments of &euro;20,000 have been made in 169 of those cases, amounting to a total of &euro;3,368,000.  The latest application received is currently being considered by the Panel. The scheme remains open.</p><p>As applications to the Scheme are not intended to be adversarial, it is not envisaged that the Applicant will require legal representation. Nevertheless, an applicant may wish to consult a solicitor and take legal advice and assistance in applying for payment under the Scheme. Accordingly, each individual invited to participate is advised of an allowance of &euro;1,500 plus VAT, payable on a vouched basis, for legal advice, both in connection with the decision to participate, and for on-going engagement.</p><p>The establishment of the ex-gratia scheme ensured that the women affected could have the impact of non-disclosure addressed without recourse to court. </p><p>Participation in the Scheme does not preclude the women from continuing (or indeed commencing) a claim in respect of CervicalCheck. However, any award for non-disclosure against the State should take account of the amount paid under the ex-gratia scheme. To date Court awards relating to non-disclosure have not exceeded &euro;10,000.</p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p><p>Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p><p>This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I requested a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny from the Business Committee, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il, and this waiver was granted on 4th February 2021. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. It is on the priority list for publication in the Spring legislative session. The Bill will be enacted upon completion of all stages in the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-04a.608.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021030400074#WRK03000"><p>A National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018) was launched by the Minister for Health in July 2014. This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. </p><p>Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and a Rare Disease Office.  Building on this progress, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period were agreed, with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI).  </p><p>Meetings, to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the continuing work ongoing in relation to Rare Diseases, have taken place with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office.  A number of key themes were identified for progression and agreed with the RDT &ndash; Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education &amp;amp; Training and Legislation &amp;amp; Policy. This will form the basis for work in this area in the time ahead.</p><p>In late 2020, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. So, from 01 September 2020, the NRDO became the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO is overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer, where the National Rare Disease Plan is firmly embedded.</p><p>The following benefits and schemes that can help with healthcare costs are available. </p><p>Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>The Long Term Illness Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p><p>Under the Long Term Illness Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p><p>Further information is available at .</p><p>As this question also relates to service matters, I have also asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In 2020, the Chief Inspector received over 8000 notifications of incidents, 1833 of these were NF01 notifications.

Extensive, ongoing and problem-solving collaboration between stakeholders, the HSE, the NTPF, HIQA and the Department continues. The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need for the HSE to establish a structured nursing home support system in line with NPHET recommendations in March 2020. This has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID-19. Guidance, PPE, staffing, serial testing, infection prevention and control training, accommodation and financial support have been provided to the nursing home sector, both public and private. In addition, multi-disciplinary clinical supports are in place at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams. </p>  <p>  In the context of the collaborative arrangements, through engagement with registered providers through inspections, check ins and review of notifications and other information, the Chief Inspector of HIQA notifies actual or potential risk when appropriate to the HSE for the purpose of identifying service providers that may require additional external support such as IPC and public health advice, PPE, clinical input etc. This support, where possible and appropriate, is typically provided by the HSE COVID-19 response teams.  In accordance with the regulatory framework, irrespective of the availability, or not, of additional HSE support to providers, nursing home operators retain legal responsibility for delivering safe care in accordance with regulation, and the regulatory oversight is provided by HIQA. Where the Department, including through the Ministers Office receives information regarding a nursing home requiring support, where appropriate, details are provided to the HSE and/or HIQA for appropriate follow up in line with the established structures. </p></reply>

The expansion of the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening programme remains a priority work programme for the National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC).</p><p>In July 2020, the NSAC approved the application to add ADA-SCID (adenosine deaminase deficiency-severe combined immunodeficiency) to the list of conditions screened under the programme. As Minister I approved this recommendation and the HSE are now preparing for the addition of ADA-SCID to the Programme which will bring the number of conditions that are screened for from eight to nine. The HSE 2021 National Service Plan states:</p><p>&lsquo;<i>Ensure the long-term management and implementation processes are in place to support expansion of the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme, including Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID).</i>&rsquo; </p><p>Across Europe, the approach taken with blood spot screening programmes does vary, with no consensus across countries as to what conditions should or should not be included. Significant variation exists in the number of conditions included for screening, both between countries and between regions within individual countries. For example, the United Kingdom currently screens for nine conditions while Italy recommends over 40 conditions be included in screening. My Department has noted that, historically, the expansion of blood spot screening programmes internationally has occurred following <i>ad hoc </i>consideration of conditions rather than following a structured and transparent approach. </p><p>I am committed to ensuring that any expansion of the programme will be safe, ethically robust and evidence based.  I have been informed by my Department that the NSAC are currently examining the international evidence in terms of the conditions screened for in existing blood spot screening programmes; the decision making processes that lead to the inclusion of a condition in an individual country&rsquo;s newborn bloodspot screening programme; and the role of emerging technologies in programme expansion. I am determined to see the foundations laid for the continuous expansion of the programme that maximises health outcomes for newborn babies. </p><p>I have requested that the NSAC provide an update on progress and I expect to receive this update in the near future.</p></reply>

Furthermore, their intended use is typically in symptomatic individuals in the early stages of infection, where samples are taken, and tests conducted by trained health professionals. There is limited performance data currently available for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic populations. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic individuals is much better than in asymptomatic individuals where data are available.</p><p>While rapid Antigen Detection Tests (ADTs) are described as rapid and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers and there are considerable human resource, operational, quality assurance, and clinical governance considerations in their administration. To date, validation work indicates that ADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population.</p><p>The HSE is currently putting in place deployment options for the use of ADTs for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p><p>Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p><p>I have also set up a group that is chaired by the government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, to examine the use of rapid tests in the community and I expect he will report in the coming weeks.  </p><p>On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

In particular, people in the over-75 age category presenting to EDs are more likely to have complex needs and require admission to hospital than the population generally. Nevertheless, the National Service Plan 2021 includes an expected activity target that 99% of patients aged 75 and over attending at an Emergency Department be discharged or admitted within 24 hours and any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is regrettable.</p>  <p>  This winter is particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The HSE Winter Plan, supported by an additional &euro;600m invested in health services, aims to reduce the number of patients waiting on trolleys for hospital admission and reduce Emergency Department waiting times while ensuring that patients and staff alike are protected in the Covid-19 environment.</p>  <p>  There are specific supports in the Winter Plan for those at greater risk including older people, the homeless, and people with chronic illnesses, facilitated through additional Community Healthcare Networks, Community Specialist Teams, and Frailty Intervention Therapy Teams operating within acute hospital EDs. These measures will create the foundation and organisational structure through which integrated care will be provided locally within the community at the appropriate level of complexity. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

This Government&rsquo;s priority is to improve waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment across all specialties, including Scoliosis.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of the deferral of elective scheduled care activity in March, April and May of 2020, and since 2nd January 2021.</p>  <p>  It is of note that key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as two-metre distancing, have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver all hospital services, including scoliosis procedures, and this has had a significant impact on both available capacity and operational activity levels.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, by 31st December 2020 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) had carried out 322 scoliosis procedures, a decrease in activity of 16% compared with 2019.</p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that under the current HSE guidelines, they have reduced the number of procedures to urgent and those that are time sensitive. Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that they are working with the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh to expand orthopaedic capacity. This is expected to have a positive impact on orthopaedic long waiting patients, including reductions in waiting times for children with scoliosis. CHI is also running additional orthopaedic clinics in City West, using a new active clinical triage model, which is reducing the number of children waiting the longest for appointments.</p>  <p>  Representatives of CHI, the Orthopaedic Spinal Team and the Advocacy Groups continue to meet as part of the Co-Design framework on a quarterly basis to work on providing solutions for patients in the spinal service.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised regarding the number of children currently waiting less than 4, 4 to 8 and more than 8 months, respectively in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital at the end of February 2021, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

I would like to commend marts, their staff and farmers for the resilience they have shown and the speed with which they have adapted to these circumstances.</p>  <p>  I understand tha tthere are distinct challenges regarding pedigree sales. My officials have also discussed the specific challenges involved with pedigree bull sales with the breed societies and mart organisations and, based on that, specific COVID-19 rules for pedigree bull sales were issued which enabled the sellers to lead the bulls by halter into the sales ring, while still ensuring the protection of public health.</p>  <p>  Under the current Level 5 restrictions, mart sales rings are closed in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 being spread when people are present in an area together. The proposal that sellers would remain with their bulls throughout the sales, interacting and speaking with buyers, would mean considerable numbers of people present in an area and interacting together for a lengthy period; this is simply not consistent with overall Level 5 restrictions.</p>  <p>  Livestock marts have systems in place to conduct online auctions and are continuing to operate, including the online sales of pedigree bulls. Cattle throughput from 1st January to 28th February 2021 was at 94.2% of the comparable period in 2020 (207,450 versus 220,169 head). Sheep throughput in the same period was at 98.8% of the comparable period for 2020 (135,234 versus 136,896 head). Online sales reach a much higher number of farmers and agents than in-person sales do. Farmers wishing to purchase pedigree bulls can avail of this system and pedigree bulls are being sold in this way. </p>  <p>  Last week, I launched the Marts ICT Infrastructure Scheme 2021. Livestock marts can apply to my Department for a grant to a maximum of &euro;5,000 to cover 50% of expenditure by a mart on necessary ICT infrastructure. Further information is available at gov.ie - Livestock Mart Licence Application (www.gov.ie).</p></reply>

These premises include homes, farms, community and health facilities, schools, and businesses.</p>  <p>  National Broadband Ireland (NBI) has been contracted by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to deliver the NBP in areas where connectivity is not commercially viable and, as such, responsibility for the NBP contract is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the impact of the NBP rollout will be transformational for rural Ireland in terms of supporting both local and regional economies and sustainable rural communities. As Minister for Rural and Community Development, I take an active interest in the progress of the NBP.</p>  <p>  Among the first deliverables under the NBP contract are Broadband Connection Points (BCPs). My Department, in collaboration with officials at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, are co-ordinating the roll-out of BCPs in every county in the State, including many of our off-shore islands. To date more than 120 BCPs have been declared 'live', with more sites connected every day.</p>  <p>  I met with NBI in February for an update on the progress of the NBP project. NBI outlined recent positive developments, with the first high-speed broadband connections in the State intervention area taking place in counties Cork and Cavan. NBI also outlined their plans to improve information to the public on when individual areas are likely to be connected.</p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan will have a profound impact on the future of our country and will provide new opportunities for rural areas in particular.  These include improved career opportunities for those living in rural areas, facilitating smart farming, allowing employers to access the pool of talent that resides outside our large towns and cities, and the provision of services such as eHealth and eLearning.</p></reply>
