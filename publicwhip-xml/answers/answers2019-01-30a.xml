However, I can assure the Deputy that when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na becomes aware of a potential threat to life, immediate steps are taken by Garda&iacute; to mitigate against this danger and they will be best placed to advise the individual in question how best to proceed in this specific case. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the manner in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na address potential safety threats to individuals is an operational matter for the Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no role in this regard. While I cannot comment on specific cases, I am willing to send details in relation to this case directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and request a report on the matter. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy is in a position to provide these details to me confidentially, I will instruct my officials to make contact with the Garda authorities and I will revert to you again once a full report has been received. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates a Witness Security Programme to counter attempts by criminal gangs and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including through the threat and the use of violence and the systematic intimidation of witnesses.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that by virtue of the highly confidential nature of the Witness Security Programme, and the absolute need to maintain the protection and safety of persons who receive support from it, that it is not the practice to detail the specifics of its operation. However, I am advised that the Witness Security Programme is supported by provisions in the Criminal Justice Acts which deal with the intimidation of a witness or jurors, the trial of offences and the provision of evidence by video-link and that the operation of the Witness Security Programme and the resources required for it are kept under continuous review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The Programme comprises of group interventions in three modules and allows responsive and flexible delivery of rehabilitation services which take account of individual risk, needs and capacity. </p><p>Statistics in relation to participants in the Programme are outlined in the following table and show some fluctuation but no significant decrease.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>TOTAL engaged in all or part of BBL.</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>20 (+ 1 dropout)</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>37 (+ 2 dropouts)</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>31 (+ 1 dropout)</td></tr></table></p><p>It is important to understand that, while the programme tends to be a particular focus for attention, it is only one of a number of assessment and intervention (treatment) pillars provided by the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service for people convicted of sexual violence.  Because many people convicted of sexual violence do not meet the criteria for the programme, there are various other pillars of intervention and management available. </p><p>These include the following; Individual offence focused work by Psychology/Probation Service; Probation Service engagement including risk assessment and management where the individual has a Post Release Supervision Order; the Psychology &lsquo;Pathways to Change&rsquo; group; Engagement with prison in-reach Psychiatry services for stabilisation and maintenance of mental health where a mental health diagnosis is made; Sex Offender Risk Assessment and Management (SORAM), which has been established to support the cooperation and coordination between key statutory organisations involved in managing the risk posed to the community by convicted sex offenders; and the Safer Lives Community Group Work Treatment Programme.</p><p>A significant number of those released, who do not participate in Building Better Lives Programme, are managed through one or more of these programmes.</p><p>The Building Better Lives programme is provided by a team of Psychologists and Probation Officers who have developed specific expertise in clinical practice including assessment and therapeutic work with men convicted of sexual offences. The criteria for participation in the Building Better Lives programme are informed by best practice and include: a prison sentence longer than 18 months to provide time to complete the programme, full admission of the offence and harm caused to the victim, robustness of personality to withstand the challenge of the group, stability of mental health, intellectual, social and developmental capacity and some literacy capacity.</p><p>I am informed that, where prisoners are not suitable for the Programme due to the denial of their offence/offending behaviour, the  Irish Prison Service has engaged with an international expert in relation to the ongoing challenges faced in the treatment and management of &lsquo;categorical deniers&rsquo;.  The preliminary findings from a 'deniers' programme run in another jurisdiction are positive and I understand the IPS Psychology Service sees this approach as the next critical step in the treatment and management of sexual violence in custody.</p><p>As I have stated, there are a number of reasons why sex offenders do not engage, including denial, lack of motivation, insufficient time in sentence, lack of suitability due to an appeal of their conviction and complexity of case. Approximately 75%  of the sex offender population are not suitable to engage in the Programme for these reasons. </p><p>For the reasons I have set out, and in keeping with best practice, the Irish Prison Service has no proposals to make offence-focused treatment for sex offenders mandatory. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-30a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013000068#WRA01500"><p>I can assure the Deputy that tackling cross-border crime is a high priority for this Government, the Garda&iacute; and our other law enforcement authorities. There is close cooperation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the border and the two police services work very closely together on a broad range of policing responsibilities.</p>  <p>  Considerable operational activity takes  place aimed at tackling  the priority areas across the range of criminal activities. In addition to the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; areas of focus &ndash; fuel, tobacco, alcohol and other excise frauds and drug trafficking &ndash; there has been focus on rural crime (thefts from farms, burglaries and road crimes) and on human trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation.  </p>  <p>  Excise fraud, including the illicit trade in fuel, tobacco and alcohol, is an area of serious concern to authorities north and south of the border. In February 2018, an investigation led by the Revenue Commissioners, uncovered a manufacturing cigarette factory in County Louth, which contained a full production facility for making cigarettes. This operation led to 23.5 million cigarettes and 71 tonnes of raw tobacco, along with tobacco precursor materials being seized. This find represents one of the largest illicit production facilities ever detected in Europe. </p>  <p>  Authorities on both sides of the border are also committed to tackling all forms of fuel fraud. Measures implemented by Revenue to tackle the problem include the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls and reporting requirements for fuel transactions to minimise the scope for fraud. In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015. The industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing the problem in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Further, the Revenue Commissioners and HM Revenue and Customs have recently initiated investigations into alcohol-diversion fraud and duty-suspended alcohol moving between both jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  The success of these cross border policing actions is grounded in the recognition that the best means of combatting this threat to our communities is to maintain and enhance  the excellent levels of cooperation between law enforcement agencies north and south of the border. The Garda&iacute; and PSNI, along with other agencies, have worked together closely for many years and enjoy an excellent working relationship and co-operation at all levels. Clearly, Brexit will have an impact on this relationship, but the Government is working towards ensuring that the co-operation can continue to the maximum extent possible.</p>  <p>  A crucial component of our shared strategy with our Northern Ireland colleagues in tackling cross border criminality has been the establishment of the Joint Agency Task Force, set up under the 'Fresh Start' Agreement of 2015. The Task Force brings together a wide range of experts drawn from policing, revenue and other enforcement agencies across both jurisdictions to co-ordinate strategic and operational actions against cross-border organised crime. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Oversight Group of the Task Force is chaired jointly at senior management level by the two police services in order to provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities. This group also includes senior personnel from relevant agencies.</p>  <p>  Senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland jointly chair the Operations Co-ordination Group, which brings forward operational actions in the six priority areas that have been the focus of the work of the Task Force. These are: Rural Crime; Immigration-related Crime; Excise Fraud; Drugs; Financial Crime and Human Trafficking.</p>  <p>  These cross-border policing structures provide a sound basis for future joint policing initiatives aimed at counter-acting cross-border criminality.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the general increase in recruitment and resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, additional Garda resources have been deployed to border areas in recent months to meet operational demands and this process is continuing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-30a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013000068#WRA01800"><p>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources to continue to successfully disrupt the operation of criminal groups who carry out gun crimes and who endanger the safety of our communities.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will have noted the significant progress made by Garda&iacute; in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime, particularly in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner-City.  I am advised by the Commissioner that there are currently a number of concentrated intelligence led operations targeting organised criminality.  These are concentrated in, but by no means confined to, the Dublin region.  </p>  <p>  Since the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau was established in March 2015, it has been responsible for the seizure of a total of ninety-one (91) firearms, including fifty-three (53) hand guns, nine (9) machine guns, seven (7) assault rifles, eight (8) shotguns; four (4) rifles and ten (10) stun guns. Many of these seizures have taken place in very dangerous circumstances where their use was allegedly  imminent.  A number of suspects have been arrested and in some cases have since been successfully convicted.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be familiar with Operation Hybrid which has been deployed since February 2016, as a result of an escalation in violence between organised crime gangs in the Dublin Metropolitan Region.  The strategic objective of Operation Hybrid is to have a three-pronged approach - preventative, investigative and targeted.  </p>  <p>  The preventative element incorporates high visibility Divisional checkpoints with armed support on checkpoints and patrols provided by Special Detective Unit, Emergency Response Unit, Armed Regional Support Unit, local Detective and plain clothes units. </p>  <p>  The investigative element involves cohesive investigation teams assigned to the murders and serious incidents, with technical and forensic investigative supports. As the Deputy may be aware, Interpol are facilitating international enquiries.</p>  <p>  The ongoing work to identify, profile and target organised crime groups is focused and intelligence led, and supported by detective units nationally and internationally.</p>  <p>  As of 13 January 2019, Operation Hybrid has resulted in:</p>  <p>  - 86 arrests.</p>  <p>  - 11 persons charged in relation to organised crime gang murder investigations,</p>  <p>  - 3 persons convicted of murder with life sentences imposed.</p>  <p>  - 37 firearms seized (specifically in relation to murder offences).</p>  <p>  - Approximately 290 searches.- 17,000 lines of enquiry conducted with more than 73,000 high visibility checkpoints implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that a number of arrests were made in the UK recently on foot of investigations, supported by An Garda Siochana, into the supply of drugs and firearms in Ireland and the UK. There were also a number of significant drug seizures made by An Garda Siochana in recent weeks.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the allocation of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I have no role in this matter. However, I can inform the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have confirmed that the organisation has been fully resourced to conduct this multi faceted approach to target organised crime groups within the Dublin Metropolitan Region and significant results have accrued by the organisation&rsquo;s ability to investigate this activity in a coordinated policing approach.  This has resulted in significant disruption in seizing drugs, cash and firearms from organised crime groups.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-30a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013000068#WRA02100"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for his continued interest in this important public safety issue. The Deputy will recall, on the occasion of his previous oral parliamentary question, that I undertook to update the Deputy in relation to the ongoing consultations conducted by my officials and I welcome the opportunity to do this now. </p>  <p>  My Department's main focus in the intervening months has been on the consideration of the detailed, formal legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General in November. As such, the scope of the consultation process has primarily involved bilateral consultation with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Transport) in the context of existing road traffic legislation.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise again that the exploration of potentially relevant legislation has served to highlight the complex nature of this issue, whereby a number of potential avenues could simultaneously aid and hinder Garda enforcement and public safety. I can assure the Deputy that a detailed consideration of the matter is ongoing in order to identify feasible next steps. </p>  <p>  My officials met again last week (22 January) with colleagues from the Department of Transport to consider the advices in greater detail. The consensus of both Departments, and the Office of the Attorney General, is that road traffic and public order legislation appears to provide adequate means for prosecuting offences relating to this antisocial behaviour. A further meeting to consider the matter is being arranged.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy is aware, the Garda&iacute; have experienced serious difficulties from an enforcement perspective when attempting to apprehend persons engaging in this dangerous and anti-social behaviour. Interception poses significant risks, not only to the drivers and passengers of these vehicles, but also to members of the public and local Garda&iacute; in affected communities. </p>  <p>  I would like, therefore, to take this opportunity to commend the Garda&iacute; involved in the successful operation that took place in Cabra on Christmas day last. This was a resource-intensive Garda operation, which posed considerable risk to the attending members. In total, 11 quad bikes and 2 cars were seized under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and 5 arrests were made for dangerous driving in accordance with section 53 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. </p>  <p>  I am informed that investigation files are being prepared for the Director of the National Juvenile Office in respect of these arrests. In addition, CCTV footage is being analysed to identify others who may be prosecutable for public order, endangerment and other associated offences. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has acknowledged the positive support from members of the community who provided information to Garda&iacute; during the operation and I would like to thank these members of the community for their support.</p>  <p>  A precursor to this successful operation was a proactive public awareness campaign in the Dublin Metropolitan Region West Garda Division. Community Policing Garda&iacute; visited schools in the area from November 2018, highlighting the dangers associated with the misuse of these vehicles and distributing information leaflets to parents to discourage the purchase of vehicles for their children. The Deputy will also be aware that the Road Safety Authority and Dublin local authorities launched safety campaigns in November 2018. These awareness-raising activities underscore the multi-pronged approach utilised by Garda&iacute;; positive results cannot be achieved by enforcement alone. </p>  <p>  Finally, my officials will update the South Dublin County Council taskforce, focusing on the misuse of scramblers/quad bikes, on the consultations that have taken place since the previous meeting of the taskforce on 14 November. The taskforce will meet again in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

However, when progressing a criminal investigation An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can, and do, request access to data held by the relevant body, pursuant to section 41 of the Data Protection Act 2018.  </p>  <p>  CCTV systems are also installed for the purposes of crime prevention and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access, such as town centres.  These fall into two distinct but complementary categories, namely Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.  Both these categories have as their legal basis section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, which deals with CCTV for the purpose of securing public order and safety in public places.  What is commonly referred to as &ldquo;community CCTV&rdquo; are systems established under section 38(3)(c) of the 2005 Act, to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have appropriate access and which is supported by the grant-aid scheme administered by my Department.</p>  <p>  The purpose of that scheme is to support local communities who wish to install CCTV systems in their localities, including access roads to their areas where appropriate. Under the scheme, which is being administered by my Department, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid toward the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system.   </p>  <p>   The Joint Policing Committees play an important role in the establishment of Community CCTV schemes - indeed their approval is one of the statutory requirements for establishment of any community CCTV scheme. In this regard, the Deputy may find it useful to engage with his local Joint Policing Committee regarding these issues.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Commissioner that on 31 December 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Cork City Division was 721, up from 644 as recently as 2016, and greater than at any time previously. There are also 39 Garda Reserves and 77 civilians attached to the Division.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,400 Garda recruits have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including 62 to the Cork City Division. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the manner in which Garda resources are deployed is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no direct role in this regard. To ensure that optimum use is made of resources, policing plans are put in place by Divisional Officers which address the particular needs of each Division including taking into account of seasonal factors which can have a bearing.</p>  <p>  One such initiative is the Lock up Light Up campaign, which is part of Operation Thor and encourages homeowners to protect their homes over the winter months, when burglaries traditionally tend to rise.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that intense Garda activity under Operation Thor has, as of January 2019, seen over 177,000 targeted checkpoints and more than 270,000 crime prevention patrols carried out nationwide. </p>  <p>  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 9,300 arrests and 10,600 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to bring pressure on the gangs and individuals responsible for these type of offences.  </p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda Division, including the Cork Division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream. </p>  <p>  Finally, I believe it is absolutely vital that, as elected officials, we continue to encourage all citizens to report all instances of criminality to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Only then can the crime be properly investigated by Garda&iacute;. Furthermore, these reports will allow the Garda authorities to identify any new or emerging crime trends affecting a particular community and, where necessary, allocate Garda resources in order to tackle these developments.</p></reply>

Bawnboy, County Cavan, is included in that pilot along with Ballinspittle, Co. Cork, Donard, Co. Wicklow, Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow, and Rush and Stepaside, Co. Dublin.  I am informed that the Garda authorities are continuing to engage with the OPW in relation to this project.  As the works required are different at each of the 6 former stations, it can be expected that they will reopen at different times.  I am informed that the works required at one station &ndash; Donard &ndash; have already been completed and the building has been handed over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the OPW.  I understand that implementation of the programme and reopening of all 5 remaining stations, including Bawnboy, is being pursued as a priority. I understand in that regard that the OPW expects works should be completed in each case in 2019. </p></reply>

Training is crucial in this regard. As you will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the training of the members and civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I am, however, informed by the Commissioner that a number of measures have been taken and further measures are underway to ensure frontline Garda&iacute; have a solid understanding of the new legislation.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the Domestic Violence Act 2018, which came into law on 1 January this year, a number of documents to support the introduction of the new Act were created and uploaded on to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s intranet portal, prior to the commencement of the Act. Every member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, of every rank, was emailed on how to access all of this information to ensure that all Garda&iacute; had ample time to familiarise themselves with the act prior to its introduction.  </p>  <p>  The information that was uploaded to the portal included the following:</p>  <p>  1. An extensive guidance document outlining the offences that remain in force from the previous Domestic Violence Act of 1996 but which have now been updated to reflect the changes in society, along with a number of new offences that were created including the offence of coercive control </p>  <p>  2. Guidance documents including one on the Special Sitting of the District Court as per Section 24 of the Act in order to facilitate how to obtain an order outside of office hours when the court not sitting and the second on coercive control which was developed in conjunction with the office of the Director of Public prosecution. </p>  <p>  3. Q &amp;amp; A document that anticipated questions that may be asked by members in relation to the new Act including information on the additional offences included in the new Act</p>  <p>  4. Documents were also created that covered every Garda action at a Domestic Abuse call, post incident engagement guidelines, guidelines on the prosecution of orders and a vulnerable victims advisory document.</p>  <p>  In addition, the following is also in the process of currently being implemented: </p>  <p>  - Train-the-trainers training is currently taking place to cover the area of coercive control. </p>  <p>  - As a result of the Train-the-trainers training the core Continuous Professional Development programme, which will run for the next two years and has been remodelled to reflect An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s advanced knowledge on domestic abuse and the role that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have when responding to domestic abuse incidents, will include training on the complexities of Domestic Abuse and the changes introduced in the new Act.</p>  <p>  - Since June 2018 bi-monthly seminars have been held in the Garda College for all serving members regardless of rank to cover all aspects of domestic abuse.  These seminars cover domestic abuse, data quality, legislation and multi-agency engagement.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Protective Services Bureau are also liaising with the College of Policing in the UK, Lancaster University Law School and London Metropolitan Police in order to establish international best practice in this area and training requirements on the provisions of the new Act will be kept under review by Garda management.</p></reply>

The new Tribunal will deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers and will replace the existing bodies which currently operate for that purpose and will be winding-down their existing caseloads. Members of the public will no longer make their complaints through the legal professional bodies as they do at present but directly to the Authority. Extensive preparations are underway at the Legal Services Regulatory Authority with the aim of being in a position to receive and process public complaints from 1 July 2019.</p>  <p>  This will coincide in time with the introduction of the new legal costs transparency regime set out in Part 10 of the 2015 Act including, separately, the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators which will maintain a publicly accessible Register of its legal costs determinations.  Similarly, the roll-out of new legal business models in the form of Legal Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships is due to take place in Quarter 1 of this year. </p>  <p>  The Legal Service Regulatory Authority's forthcoming actions are set out in its first Strategic Plan for 2018-2020 which I laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 May 2018 as required under the 2015 Act. The Plan, under which the Authority is set to come into substantial operational mode in the middle of this year, sets out the indicative timelines for the roll-out of the Authority's key functions. As Minister I will, of course, continue to support this in each instance with the timely commencement of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act.</p></reply>

in the case of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that is the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  It might be helpful if I outline briefly the manner in which protected disclosures made to me by members or former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are handled in my Department. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, the correspondence is assessed to determine whether it constitutes a Protected Disclosure under the Act.  Second, consideration is given to what action is required by me as Minister.  Depending on the individual case, actions may include seeking a Garda report from the Garda Commissioner (having first confirmed that the individual is agreeable to that course of action); referring matters to GSOC under powers available to me as Minister under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005; or referring matters to an external body or person for review. </p>  <p>  In December 2018, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General, I established a panel of counsel to assess disclosures made to me by members or former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The purpose of the panel is to provide independent advice to my Department on how each case should be treated.  In order to ensure an independent assessment of these matters, counsel have been instructed to assess all relevant documentation relating to the allegations, without prejudice, and to make whatever recommendations they see fit.  </p>  <p>  There is no timeframe specified in the Act for the assessment of protected disclosures.  The Deputy will appreciate that, by their very nature, this correspondence may involve varying degrees of complexity and careful consideration of each issue.  However, I am anxious that there will be no unnecessary delays in carrying out the assessment and following through on any recommended actions.</p>  <p>  With regard to the handling of disclosures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Deputy may be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published a Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda members and Garda staff have been informed of this policy.  A Protected Disclosures Manager was appointed.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are properly protected and supported.  Transparency's &ldquo;Integrity at Work&rdquo; pledge was signed by the Garda Commissioner in 2017.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Code of Ethics includes very strong commitments for each individual member in relation to 'Speaking Up and Reporting Wrongdoing'.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have previously committed to ensuring that anyone who brings forward issues or concerns will be listened to and supported whilst also ensuring that the identity of any worker making a protected disclosure in accordance with this policy is protected, save in accordance with Section 16(2) of the Protected Disclosure Act, 2014 which provides exceptions in clearly defined circumstances.  These commitments have included that the focus of this process will be on the wrongdoing rather than the person making the disclosure. </p>  <p>  The policy is a standing item on the agenda for Governance meetings between my Department and the Garda Commissioner at which assurance is provided in relation to the operation of the policy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that a review of the 2014 Act was completed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in July 2018 which concluded that no legislative amendments should be made at this time, but noted that the EU Directive on whistleblowing which is currently being negotiated is expected to result in amendments to the Act in the context of its transposition.</p>  <p>  However, while no legislative changes are currently being considered, my Department is actively engaging in a process of review initiated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform concerning the policies and procedures presently in place governing disclosures.  Any changes resulting from this review will be applied to protected disclosures made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

The Protocol also confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, &ldquo;will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits&rdquo; that come with EU citizenship. In addition, through the Protocol, the UK has confirmed its commitment to ensure &ldquo;no diminution of the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity that are set out in the Good Friday Agreement&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The Common Travel Area (CTA) is a long-standing arrangement between the UK and Ireland which means Irish citizens can move freely to live, work, and study in the UK on the same basis as UK citizens and vice versa. It provides for associated rights and privileges including access to employment, healthcare, education, social protection, and social housing, as well as the right to vote in certain elections. Both the Irish and British governments have committed that the CTA will be maintained in all circumstances, and their ability to do so is acknowledged in Article 5 of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s focus must remain on getting the Withdrawal Agreement ratified, which remains the best way to ensure an orderly UK exit, including by ensuring the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.</p>  <p>   While it is in no party&rsquo;s interest to end up with no deal, the Government, in close cooperation with the EU, will continue and intensify our work on preparedness for all possible outcomes, with increased focus on no deal preparations.</p></reply>

The accommodation services for those persons is managed within my Department by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA). </p>  <p>  There has been a sustained rise in demand for accommodation services in recent years. At the end of 2016, there were 4,425 persons resident in accommodation centres. At the end of 2017 there was 5,096 persons and at the end of 2018, there was 6,106 persons resident in accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that there is significant turnover within the population using accommodation centres as new applicants are entering the system and others are exiting the system. In 2018, there were 2,480 new applications for accommodation and 1,462 persons left their accommodation.</p>  <p>  In order to meet this increase in demand, RIA has been expanding capacity within existing centres and identifying new premises for use as accommodation centres through expressions of interest published in the national press. As a result of these efforts, there was a net gain of 757 bed spaces within the portfolio.</p>  <p>  RIA have identified two further accommodation centres in Moville, Co. Donegal and Rooskey, Co. Leitrim for opening. As the Deputy is aware, both of these premises were the subject of fires and in both instances, discussions are ongoing with the respective contractors to get the centres open.</p>  <p>  As a result of the rising demand and the delays in opening the accommodation centres in Moville and Rooskey, and in order to ensure that the State can continue to provide accommodation for all protection applicants and continue to comply with the EU Reception Directive which was transposed into Irish law in June of last year, RIA has, since September, arranged for the provision of emergency beds where the mainstream accommodation centres were at capacity.  </p>  <p>  As a result of this increased demand, my Department has had to use emergency beds on a temporary basis. Given that the accommodation is utilised on a temporary basis there is no set contract in place with each provider. </p>  <p>  As of 20 January 2019, RIA was using hotel accommodation to accommodate 337 persons in 10 hotels in Cavan, Dublin, Louth, Monaghan and Waterford. </p>  <p>  RIA is making every effort to secure sufficient capacity to meet the demand and to remove the need for protection applicants to be placed in emergency hotels. As I mentioned previously, RIA is seeking to open new accommodation centres in Moville and Rooskey. In addition, some 12% of the people currently residing in the accommodation centres (over 700 people), have permission to remain in Ireland.  The fact that people are staying in the centres for some time after they receive permission to remain is a situation that is putting increased pressure on the system as new arrivals have to be accommodated. Where an individual or family has permission to remain in Ireland they can access the mainstream housing supports and services on the same basis as nationals/European Economic Area nationals. </p>  <p>  Considerable work continues to be done to support residents with status to move out of accommodation centres and to secure long term accommodation in Ireland. A number of NGOs have been awarded monies under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) specifically to assist and support residents with international protection status move out of accommodation centres into longer term accommodation.  Additionally, the Department of Justice and Equality has also provided funding and are working with NGOs to assist those with status/permission to remain secure accommodation.</p>  <p>  In order to meet the accommodation needs of asylum seekers in the longer term, the Department has recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to persons in the protection process, by way of the independent living model, will be advertised. This process is scheduled to continue throughout 2019 and is due for completion in 2020. This will be delivered via a series of regional competitions to cover the entire State.</p></reply>

However, Brexit does increase the risk that dissidents and criminals may seek to undermine peace on the island and engage in general illegal cross border activities. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for operational matters including the distribution of personnel, which is kept under review in line with operational and security demands.  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is preparing for Brexit with a wide-ranging focus to determine operational requirements, including personnel, infrastructure, training and technology and will continue to progress their contingency preparations. They are committed to ensuring the organisation is prepared for the associated policing implications and challenges arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will provide the resources required to keep our people and our communities safe.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner has been provided with an additional &euro;100 million in 2019 bringing his total budget to almost &euro;1.8 billion.  This substantial investment will allow the accelerated recruitment programme to continue in tandem with new and leading edge technology being deployed to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work and increasing visibility in the Border Divisions.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner intends to recruit 600 trainee Garda&iacute; and 600 Garda Staff (civilians) in 2019 The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will facilitate the redeployment this year of 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline duties for which they are trained. </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing increase in Garda resources, the Commissioner has deployed a number of additional Garda&iacute; to border counties in recent months and this will continue. </p>  <p>  In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can be provided through normal deployment. These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management and detailed consideration given in due course to the medium to long-term implications.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and cross-border crime. The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.</p></reply>

The court has the power to refuse bail where there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is likely to commit a serious offence. In assessing this likelihood, the court must take into account the nature and seriousness of the offence, the accused person&rsquo;s previous offending and may also take into account the danger he or she poses to the public if bail is granted. </p><p>The Criminal Justice Act 2017 also strengthened Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail providing a power of arrest without warrant in certain circumstances, and made provisions to increase the use of curfews and to facilitate the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that given the new bail laws were only introduced in 2017, the full impact of these provisions will not yet be reflected in the official recorded crime statistics. As you will be aware, the Central Statistics (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of the official recorded crime statistics.  The table at Appendix A shows the number of crime incidents which are recorded as having at least one offender on bail for the years 2013-2017.  The figures for 2018 are not available from the CSO at this time.</p><p>It is worth noting that all statistics on recorded crimes are currently categorised as &ldquo;Under Reservation&rdquo;.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO), in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to make good progress on returning the crime figures to the higher standard expected of our national crime statistics.  I am determined that this body of work be completed as soon as possible and I welcome the continued diligence of the Policing Authority in monitoring this matter.</p><p>Appendix A</p><p>The following table shows the number of crime incidents which are recorded as having at least one offender on bail for the years 2013-2017.

The report provides us with a valuable insight into public perceptions of migrants and migration in Ireland, and it is encouraging to see the largely positive and welcoming attitudes to migrants. The report reinforces Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an open, tolerant and welcoming society, a reputation that is well established. </p>  <p>  Migration is good for the State socially, politically and economically. While EU citizens enjoy free movement, there are a number of schemes and policies to facilitate legal migration pathways into Ireland for non-EEA nationals.  Many of these people subsequently make their homes here and became naturalised as Irish citizens. Indeed since 2011, over 120,000 people, including just over 27,000 children have been naturalised. It is heartening to read that the public share the view of Government on these issues as demonstrated by our many pathways for legal migration and our supports for international protection applicants and refugees. </p>  <p>  We have seen unparalleled international population movements arising from conflict, hunger and climate change. Ireland has played its role in responding to such challenges. From the outset of the migration crisis in Europe, we have demonstrated our commitment to solidarity and to protecting the most vulnerable people.  With the approval of the Oireachtas, Ireland opted into two EU Council Decisions on the Relocation programme and we established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme under which the Government pledged to accept a total of 4,000 people into the State.  This programme has evolved in response to needs including welcoming minors from the Calais camp, and more recently the ships who have encountered humanitarian difficulties in the Mediterranean.   </p>  <p>  In addition, operating under discretionary Ministerial powers, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Humanitarian Admission Programme (IHAP) 2 provides an opportunity to Irish citizens and persons with international protection status who have immediate eligible family members from the UN's list of top 10 major source countries of refugees, to propose to the Minister for these family members to join them in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In relation to international protection generally, a proactive approach to reform has been adopted including opting into the Recast reception Conditions Directive, providing the right to work as well as the implementation of a wide range of reforms recommended by the Mc Mahon Working Group.  </p>  <p>  The Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published by Government on 7 February 2017, offers a blueprint to promote the integration of all migrants who are legally in the State, for the period to 2020.  Many of the recommendations in this report will inform the implementation of the strategy. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to operate a fair and humane immigration and protection policy.

I am informed by the Commissioner that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of resources. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 2,400 recruits have attested as members and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, including the 800 trainees who passed out from the college during 2018. </p><p>The Government has increased the budget by for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year.  The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and, in addition, it is his intention to recruit a net 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase the overall strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 Garda members will be achieved by the target date of 2021. The Government fully supports the Commissioner&rsquo;s management decision which will ensure that increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; are available for frontline duties in the prevention and detection of criminal activity in 2019 and beyond.</p><p>In keeping with Government policy, there are no plans to provide for a hard border on the island but Brexit increases the risk that dissidents and criminals may seek to undermine peace on the island and engage in general illegal cross border activities. As part of the ongoing increase in Garda resources, the Commissioner has deployed a number of additional Garda&iacute; to border counties, including Donegal, in recent months and this will continue.</p><p>In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can be provided through normal deployment. These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management and detailed consideration given in due course to the medium to long-term implications.</p><p>The Garda strength of the Donegal Division from 2009  up to 31 December 2018, as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following links.</p><p>For additional and more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link: </p></reply>

Notably, on 11 December 2018, the CSO published a third review of the quality of recorded crime statistics, based on data recorded on the PULSE database system for crimes reported to Garda&iacute; in 2017. The review concluded, inter-alia, that clear improvements had been made in the manner in which criminal incidents were being recorded on the PULSE system. </p>  <p>  While this is encouraging, it is also clear that there is more work to be done in this area and my Department, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, will continue to monitor the progress of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in ensuring that the national crime statistics are returned to the higher standard required by the CSO.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to address knife crime through education and engagement with communities. I am advised that at an operational level, Garda&iacute; pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife-related crime through the strategic deployment of Garda resources.  Areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  </p></reply>

In tandem with this the Bill will place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out this function.

In exercising this function the Garda Commissioner ensures that relevant policing developments in other jurisdictions are reviewed on an on-going basis so that international best practice can be identified and, where appropriate, applied throughout An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition when developing policy or legislative proposals on policing matters my Department would always have regard to international models. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 contains provisions to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to operate to international best practice. For example, the Act requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services, therefore, every inspection conducted by the Garda Inspectorate, and any recommendation arising therefrom, has involved examining and taking account of policing best practice internationally. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note one of the functions of the Garda Professional Standards Unit, is to promote the highest standards of practice, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services. The Unit undertakes reviews, as directed by the Garda Commissioner, into operational, administrative and management matters relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels. Arising from these reviews, measures to improve performance and promote the highest standards of practice throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are proposed. The Garda Commissioner draws on the Unit's proposals to enhance policing practices and policies</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) carries out long term strategic and short term tactical investigations into the activities of Organised Crime Gangs (OCGs) based both here and on the European Continent and has strategic partners in the United Kingdom, Spain, Holland and Belgium; countries where OCGs affecting the Irish jurisdiction tend to be the most proactive. Information and intelligence regarding drug trafficking is disseminated and procured through international agencies such as Europol and Interpol.</p>  <p>  The GNDOCB has forged an important relationship with the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre for Narcotics (MAOC-N) which seeks to intercept sailing vessels from South America carrying primarily high quality cocaine destined for the European market. The GNDOCB also liaises closely with the National Crime Agency (NCA) in the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing published its report on 18 September. With regard to combatting organised crime, the Commission recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s security and intelligence capability must be strengthened, with the ability to recruit specialist expertise. </p>  <p>  On 18 December 2018, the Government endorsed the Commission&rsquo;s report and accepted all 157 key recommendations, including the aforementioned. I also published a high level plan, &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo;, which sets out the approach to implementation over the next four years of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, which will be overseen by a dedicated programme office in the Department of the Taoiseach, as recommended in the Commission&rsquo;s Report. As set out in the implementation plan, work will commence on the identification of the requirements to strengthen An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s security and intelligence capability in 2019. </p>  <p>  As I said on publication of the implementation plan, the Government has endorsed the Commission&rsquo;s clear vision for a modern, highly professional police service. Implementation of this programme for reform will not only address current challenges in policing, but also enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet future challenges and allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to evolve in a coherent and strategic manner in accordance with international best practice.</p></reply>

Three main types of costs were identified: lost economic output, provision of services, including health, legal, social and specialised; and the personal (physical and emotional) impact on the victim. The report is structured around these types of costs, providing accounts of the investigations into the methodologies in each of these fields found in the relevant literature. </p>  <p>  The EIGE report concluded that the detailed case study it reported on would not be easy to replicate in other countries. This is largely because the data requirements are high and the field of gender-based and intimate partner violence has insufficient data collected to meet these requirements in most countries. EIGE concluded that there is currently insufficient data to robustly cost the impact of intimate partner violence separately for each EU-28 Member State.</p>  <p>  My Department has also considered this issue and concluded that methodological and data deficiencies militated against a robust cost estimation of the impact of domestic violence in Ireland. </p>  <p>  To illustrate the difficulties involved, a Council of Europe Study examined a range of estimates of the cost of gender-based violence. Depending on data and methods used, the lowest cost estimate was just 1.6% of the highest cost estimate, rendering any estimation meaningless in the context of such a broad divergence.  </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with various EIGE meetings in relation to administrative data on gender-based violence and will continue to do so.</p></reply>

In that regard, I have recently engaged in consultations with parties and political groupings on the scope of the constitutional amendment that might be proposed.</p>  <p>  The Government has agreed that the proposal on divorce to be put to the people in the May referendum will, subject to the passage of the necessary Constitution Amendment Bill by the D&aacute;il and Seanad, contain two elements.  </p>  <p>  The first proposal is an amendment to Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution to remove the minimum living apart period for spouses applying for a divorce.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to deal with the living apart period by way of ordinary legislation.  If the referendum is passed, the Government will bring forward a Bill to amend section 5(1)(a) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 to reduce the minimum living apart period specified in that Act from four years during the previous five years to two years during the previous three years.</p>  <p>  If the referendum is passed, the existing provisions in Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution which require that there be no prospect of reconciliation and that proper provision exists or will be made for spouses and children will continue in force in the Constitution. It will also remain the case that only a court can grant a divorce. </p>  <p>  The second proposal is an amendment to replace the provision on recognition of foreign divorces in Article 41.3.3º of the Constitution.  The people will be asked to approve new text to replace Article 41.3.3º with a modern, readily-understandable provision which clearly provides that the Oireachtas may legislate for the recognition of divorces obtained outside the State.</p>  <p>  The Government intends to bring forward its proposals for amendments to Articles 41.3.2º and 41.3.3º of the Constitution by way of amendments to the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Divorce) Bill 2016 (PMB), which is currently awaiting Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  With regard to the proposed referendum on Article 41.2, Minister of State Stanton and I are considering the Report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, published on 6 December 2018, on pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the 38th Amendment of the Constitution (Role of Women) Bill, with a view to making proposals to Government in due course.</p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award. </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006. </p>  <p>  B.

In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognize the brave actions of these men.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.</p></reply>

These structures and groups facilitate a whole of Government approach to Brexit preparedness and contingency planning. </p>  <p>  The Assistant Secretary Group on no deal Brexit Planning, co-chaired with the Department of the Taoiseach, meets on a very regular basis in Government buildings.

My Department does not collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy.  In addition, it should be noted that the Central Bank of Ireland does not systematically record any information on retentions or partial settlement payments in the standard returns submitted by companies, however it does get information on the aggregate amounts paid and aggregate amounts outstanding for different classes of business, but cannot tell whether the outstanding amounts relate to claims that have been partially paid or are fully outstanding.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, I have been advised that the making of interim payments, particularly in a property repair context is a standard practice by most insurers.  Different insurers may adopt different approaches to the use of interim payments and may retain different levels of the overall amount (retention), however you should be aware that this is generally a commercial contractual matter between the insured and his or her insurer and is set out in the policy document.</p><p>The use of interim payments generally arises in a situation where the full extent of the liability may not be known until works have been completed.  The intention behind this approach is to ensure that the customer can afford to meet the payments as they arise during the repair work for cash-flow reasons, notwithstanding that he or she expects to recover the full cost of the overall work from the insurer.  Retention, in this context, refers to an amount held back by the insurer until it can confirm that the works required have been completed and final invoices or receipts are available that validate the costs incurred for the repair/ reinstatement work.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Consumer Protection Code includes provisions related to insurance claims handling processes.  The practice of retention is not prohibited by law or any other regulatory requirement such as the Code. However the Central Bank expects that firms will act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers in accordance with the general principles of the Code.  To this end, it has conducted reviews in relation to retention in the past.  I am aware, for example, that in 2013, it requested insurers to make clearer to policyholders their general approach to retention at the time of the product being purchased and again when a claim is instigated.</p><p>It is also worth noting that where any consumer is dissatisfied with the service received from his or her insurance provider, including on interim payments and retention, he or she should consult the website of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman &ndash;  &ndash; which advises on the correct complaints procedure that consumers may follow should they wish to formally complain. </p><p>Finally, as the Deputy is aware this issue  of retention and interim payments has arisen on foot of negative feedback that  Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy  has received personally from policyholders of delays in claims processing in relation to recent storms.  As indicated in a previous PQ the Minister of State has asked that his concerns be further examined by members of the Cost of Insurance Working Group over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

However, a Revenue Commissioners concession allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain types of vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  Revenue has since decided to remove this concession with effect from 1 March 2019 so that all food supplements will be charged at the standard VAT rate.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products, licenced by the Health Products Regulatory Association will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated. </p>  <p>  The operation of the concession became extremely problematic as a result of efforts by certain businesses in the industry to extend the concession beyond the scope permitted. Consistent challenges to Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products gave rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  However, independent of Revenue&rsquo;s decisions on interpretation, I agreed during the recent Finance Bill to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group Paper to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements.</p></reply>

Revenue have advised me that &quot;a small number of instances&quot; refers to no more than 10-15 cases.</p><p>For the deputy's reference, 901 appeals were received by the TAC in 2016, 1,751 appeals in 2017 and 1,680 in 2018. Thus, instances where section 949AG was considered to be used inappropriately account for less than 1% of the total cases received by the TAC in the period from its establishment to year end 2018.  However the Deputy will be aware that only a minority of cases proceed to a full hearing and determination.</p><p>Legislative change in respect of section 949AG was raised by and discussed with both the Appeal Commissioners and Revenue. Both parties indicated that they had no objection to the deletion of section 949AG. Their view was that the removal of the section (as well as a consequential amendment to section 669 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to re-insert a provision which was removed when section 949AG was originally enacted) would address the concern identified while not adversely affecting the TAC's ability to require the provision of information as needed. </p><p>The current legislation provides the TAC with a wide range of other powers to require Revenue and appellants to supply information to assist the Appeal Commissioners in their adjudication and determination of an appeal. It is considered that these powers are sufficiently extensive to allow for the effective operation of the appeals process. However, the removal of section 949AG precludes any assertion that it should apply in all situations, even in those where there is no statutory requirement for the Appeal Commissioners to have regard to the same matters to which Revenue was required to have regard.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it previously provided information on the number of appeals made to the Circuit Court, and decisions given by that Court, in the years 2012 and 2013 to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. The information was provided as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Finance (Tax Appeals) Bill 2015 conducted by that Committee on 27 January 2015. After that meeting, Revenue provided some follow-up information in writing to the Committee and its letter of 13 February 2015 included the following statistics in relation to appeals to the Circuit Court:</p><p><b>Circuit Court Decisions:</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total Appealed to Circuit Court</th><th>Total Decisions</th><th>For Revenue</th><th>% of Decisions</th><th>For Taxpayer</th><th>% of Decisions</th><th>Ongoing</th><th>Settled/Withdrawn</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>28</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>86%</td><td>1</td><td>14%</td><td>13</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>33</td><td>19</td><td>17</td><td>89%</td><td>2</td><td>11%</td><td>3</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>61</td><td>26</td><td>23</td><td>88%</td><td>3</td><td>12%</td><td>16</td><td>19</td></tr></table></p><p>At the time, Revenue also estimated that the Appeal Commissioners made 110 determinations in 2012 and 118 determinations in 2013 (228 in total).  However, it is not possible to say how many cases were heard (but not determined) by the Appeal Commissioners in those years.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that Section 27(4) of the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015 preserved the right of some appellants to appeal to the Circuit Court in certain circumstances in respect of existing appeals following the establishment of the TAC.  To date one appeal has been appealed to the Circuit Court in accordance with this provision. The Circuit Court upheld the TAC&rsquo;s determination.</p></reply>

No. 482 of 2016), contains a right to open a payment account with basic features with a credit institution. This right extends to any person who is legally resident in the European Union, regardless of whether he or she has a fixed address.</p>  <p>  A payment account with basic features is similar to a regular payment account in many respects. It allows a person to place money in the account, withdraw cash from the account, and to make payments using direct debits, debit cards, or credit transfers. An important difference is that a payment account with basic features does not offer credit facilities, such as an overdraft.</p>  <p>  Regulation 16 of the European Union (Payment Accounts) Regulations 2016 permits a credit institution to refuse to open an account on one of two grounds. Those grounds are set out in the legislation, but essentially are that the applicant already holds a payment account or that refusal is necessary to comply with money laundering and terrorist financing legislation.</p>  <p>  Regulation 16 (5) stipulates that, where a relevant credit institution decides to refuse an application, it shall: </p>  <p>  &ldquo;(a) notify the applicant in writing and free of charge of the refusal and the grounds for the refusal, unless such notification would be contrary to section 49 of the Act of 2010 or objectives of national security or public policy,</p>  <p>  (b) where the refusal is on the grounds referred to in paragraph (4), take appropriate measures as required under Chapter 4 of Part 4 of the Act of 2010,</p>  <p>  (c) advise the consumer of:-</p>  <p>  (i) the procedure for submitting a complaint to it against the refusal, and</p>  <p>  (ii) the consumer&rsquo;s right to contact the Bank and the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to the refusal, including the relevant contact details.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Firms should also be mindful of provision 2.11 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code). This provides that a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it &ldquo;without prejudice to the pursuit of its legitimate commercial aims, does not, through its policies, procedures, or working practices, prevent access to basic financial services&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  If an applicant is refused an account he or she can submit a complaint against that decision to the credit institution. A consumer who has a complaint that is not resolved by the credit institution&rsquo;s internal complaints mechanism may make a complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is the designated competent authority for the purposes of the European Union (Payment Accounts) Regulations 2016.

The pay increases involved are those covering the 2018 to 2020 period under the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA), as legislated for in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. To date, those pay increases consist of: 1% of salary on 1 January 2018; 1% of salary on 1 October 2018; and, finally, 1% of salary on 1 January 2019, in respect of individuals in receipt of annual salaries of up to &euro;30,000.</p>  <p>  The principle of pay parity underlies the pension increases sanctioned in the Circular. This means that pay increases agreed as part of the PSSA are passed on to pension recipients to bring the salary on which their pension is based up to the current salary of those still serving after the pay increases are applied. It is important to note that not all pension recipients will be due these increases. This is because of protections in place (known as &lsquo;grace periods&rsquo;) for public servants retiring after the application of pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation, whereby their pensions were calculated using the higher pay rates that were in effect prior to the application of the pay cuts. </p>  <p>  As current salary rates for serving staff are being progressively restored to the pre-FEMPI cut levels, it will mean that for increasing numbers of pension recipients, the salary on which their pension is based will be overtaken by the current salary rates for serving staff, with the result that these pensioners will qualify for pension increases.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the public service pension payroll managers in the various sectors of the public service to implement Circular 02/2018. I understand that work is underway to apply the pay increases I have mentioned to those qualifying pensions in payment that have not yet benefitted from such increases, and that this will include the calculation and payment of arrears as appropriate.</p></reply>

This process, which involves the transfer of live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and closure model of the patronage divesting process, is aimed at significantly increasing patron diversity. </p><p>There are two Phases to the new process - the Identification Phase and the Implementation Phase.</p><p>The Identification Phase is currently underway in 16 initial areas nationwide, one per Education and Training Board (ETB) area. The<i></i>Identification Phase involves ETBs identifying an area where there is likely to be unmet oncoming demand for a multi or non-denominational school, and surveying pre-school parents (in partnership with the local childcare committee) to assess the level of this oncoming demand. ETBs then meet with the local majority patron (the relevant Catholic Bishop/Archbishop) to outline the results of the survey and discuss options for a reconfiguration of existing schools to meet this oncoming demand.  The response by the patron is included in a report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department, who will subsequently publish the reports.  It is envisaged that the reports from the initial areas will be published in the first half of this year.</p><p>Following the publication of the first round of reports, the Schools Reconfiguration process will move into the Implementation Phase.  It is envisaged that the Implementation Phase<i></i>will be led by the existing majority patron (the relevant Catholic Bishop/Archbishop). Central to this phase is consultation with parents as part of the school community where voluntary reassignment of patronage of a school is envisaged. Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing.</p><p>The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the process allows for any school community to directly engage their current patron, outside of the main process, and to seek a transfer of patronage to a multi-denominational patron, fast-tracking the patronage reassignment.  Already the first reconfiguration has successfully taken place, with Two-Mile Community National School in Kerry opening in September 2017 under the &quot;Early Movers&quot; provision of this new process.  I encourage any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage under the &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision to contact their school patron directly.</p><p>Separately, following agreement with the Archdiocese of Dublin and Archdiocese of Armagh last year and on foot of requests from the local communities, two former Catholic schools in Faughart, Co. Louth and Brannoxtown, Co. Kildare continued to serve their local communities under new multi-denominational patronage as Community National Schools from September 2018. </p><p>During this initial rollout of the reconfiguration process, the precise number of schools that will transfer in a two-year timeframe is difficult to predict, given that any such number will be dependent on many factors, including the results of the parental consultation in each area. </p><p>While the Schools Reconfiguration process structures are being progressed, my Department is continuing to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified as part of the 2012 and 2013 surveys under the patronage divesting process.  In this regard, from 2013 to 2018, 11 multi-denominational schools have opened under the patronage divesting process and a twelfth school has been announced to be established under this process for September 2019.<i></i>As the Deputy may be aware, the divestment model does not involve building new schools but requires the availability of school premises vacated, for example, due to amalgamation or closure.</p><p>There is no one model which will provide a universal answer to this complex issue and in the context of an expanding population and increasing demand for multi-denominational education. There is room for a number of different multi- and non-denominational patrons to respond to different parental wishes through the different process now in place, including the schools reconfiguration process and the process for establishing new schools in areas of demographic growth.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA). By way of information Co. Tipperary is split between the NEPS South-West and Mid-Munster Regions and services to schools in North and South Tipperary are provided by staff operating from its offices in  Clonmel and Limerick respectively.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. In this regard therefore NEPS psychologists engage with their allocated schools, and directly with students therein, based on the needs as presented rather than on a particular annual quantum of assessments.</p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

Mountjoy also has designated areas to facilitate family visits which include a family-friendly space, round tables/family seating and access to play materials.  In addition temporary release for access/visits to children for family occasions is regularly approved in most prisons. </p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service also provides family-friendly training to &lsquo;front of house&rsquo; staff, which aims to improve staff awareness of the effects of imprisonment on families and allows staff to appropriately support families and children visiting prisons.</p></reply>

There has been some good progress on the programme in 2018, as well as in other major projects in relation to the Garda estate, including in particular completion and entry into operational use of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters at Wexford, Galway and Kevin Street (Dublin), which collectively required funding of over &euro;100 million.

Having previously been transferred from the Department of Defence to Tipperary County Council, I am informed by the OPW that all difficulties in relation to completion of transfer of the site from Tipperary County Council to the OPW have been resolved and that the final transfer is being finalised this week. On completion, ownership of all three sites will be vested in the OPW. </p><p>The development of PPP projects is progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA).  </p><p>Work is ongoing within my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the next stage of this important project and my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are actively engaging with the NDFA with a view to progressing the matter further. My Department is also engaging with the NDFA in relation to delivery via PPP of a Courts Service project at a site in Hammond Lane, Dublin 7. </p><p>It is not possible to provide a timeframe for the completion of these projects at this point, however I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new stations at Sligo, Clonmel and Macroom through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018) to enable the Director of the Decision Support Service to progress the preparation of the codes of practice as soon as the multi-disciplinary group submits its recommendations to the Director. </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options. </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is not yet operational but every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible.  While the Decision Support Service has been working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020, the situation is being kept under review as the preparatory work on implementation moves forward. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.</p></reply>

The court has the power to refuse bail where there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is likely to commit a serious offence. In assessing this likelihood, the court must take into account the nature and seriousness of the offence, the accused person&rsquo;s previous offending and may also take into account the danger he or she poses to the public if bail is granted. The Criminal Justice Act 2017 also strengthened Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail providing a power of arrest without warrant in certain circumstances, and made provisions to increase the use of curfews and to facilitate the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances. </p>  <p>  In terms of available statistics, the Deputy will appreciate that given the new bail laws were only introduced in 2017, the full impact of these provisions will not yet be reflected in the official recorded crime statistics. It is too early to assess whether or not these changes are having the desired effect. It is important to await the evidence of the impact of this new legislation and take the time to evaluate the effect that this Act is having before we explore further changes to the law.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-30a.288.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013000072#WRE03300"><p>I can assure  the Deputy that tackling organised crime activity is a key ongoing priority for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Government, for its part, is committed to providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the necessary resources to tackle this, and all, forms of criminality in our State.</p>  <p>  Given the fluid nature of criminal groupings, it is extremely difficult to quantify the number of criminal gangs operating at any particular time. Splinter groups and new gangs can form overnight. Organised Crime is constantly evolving and new innovations in crime are continuously emerging.</p>  <p>  From time to time, the question has arisen of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts, with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have a similar permanency of organisation and structure that might pertain to a typical subversive organisation or other more fixed group.  Similarly, relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid, with shifting memberships and alliances, and a given individual's affiliation with a criminal network might itself be entirely contingent, contextual and ephemeral. </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  </p>  <p>  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence. </p>  <p>  In recent years a number of other legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime. For example, the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;; in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to order to prevent them being disposed of, and I am pleased that the provisions of this Act are being used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that a comprehensive body of legislation exists to provide for the prosecution for offences relating to organised crime and targeting the proceeds of crime. I believe that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the support of the significant additional resources provided to it by this Government, will prevail in facing down the threat of gangland violence in our communities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have faced down this type of threat in the past and will do so again. </p></reply>

It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations, including drug distribution.  </p>  <p>  The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke design process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development.</p>  <p>  I understand that proposals for a Greentown Programme intervention model are expected to be finalised early in 2019. I am also advised that it is intended to commence a trial of the Greentown Programme approach, on a pilot basis, in one locality during 2019. </p>  <p>  In addition to this An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to confront drug-related crime utilising intelligence-led operations and multi-disciplinary approaches to target organised crime groups and individuals involved in crime. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that tackling organised crime activity and those involved in it is an ongoing priority for the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that the necessary resources will continue to be made available to address this issue.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme<b></b>2016-2021 is based on agreed Garda priorities in relation to their accommodation needs nationwide.  It involves over &euro;60 million exchequer funding spread across both the OPW and Garda Votes as well as a major PPP.

Engagement in such programmes offers purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences and encourages offenders to lead law-abiding lives on release. These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services, including first-time offenders. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish Prison Service has contracted the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) to provide two prison-based operational services, the Training &amp;amp; Employment Officer Service and the Resettlement Coordinator Service, both of which are aimed at assisting in reintegration and reducing reoffending. </p>  <p>   The Training &amp;amp; Employment Officer and the individual prisoner work together to identify an improved pathway in life, away from a life of offending. This includes working to identify and remove any barriers that stand in the way of positive change, and setting out the necessary steps to achieving a new way of life. In practical terms, this means guiding people into employment or training and educational programmes that help the person realise their ultimate goals.  This service is available in the Mountjoy Campus, the West Dublin Campus, Portlaoise, Midlands, Castlerea, and Shelton Abbey Open Centre.</p>  <p>   In 2018, the prison-based Training &amp;amp; Employment Officers worked with prisoners and other services to place 114 prisoners in work or work experience, 195 prisoners in training or further education, and completed guidance and group work with another 106 prisoners. In 2018, the Training &amp;amp; Employment Officers engaged with 873 referred prisoners. </p>  <p>   In addition the Irish Prison Service has contracted the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) to provide resettlement coordinators in each of our closed prisons to act as a central point of reference for prisoners and external agencies in the process of identifying suitable accommodation options prior to release. An additional post-release coordinator is provided to Cork Prison by the Cork Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force.</p>  <p>  Resettlement coordinators take a case-management approach to intervening with a prisoner 9 to 12 months pre-release to commence planning for post-release supports, including amongst other functions, working with the individual in custody to submit housing, welfare and medical card applications well in advance of release. </p>  <p>  While specific statistics are not available, evidence shows that addressing such factors as education, employment, housing, drug and alcohol misuse, attitudes and self control, institutionalisation and life skills contributes to reduced reoffending.</p>  <p>  The latest data in relation to recidivism rates for offenders who were given a custodial sentence or community sanction is contained in the fourth set of recidivism studies published by the Central Statistics Office in November 2016. </p>  <p>  There has been a continued reduction in the recidivism level for the cohort of prisoners released in 2010, these are the latest figures available on the Central Statistics Office website. The Prison Recidivism Studies for 2007, 2008 and 2009 showed a recidivism rate of 55%, 51% and 47.5% respectively. The overall figure for 2010 is 45.1% which represents a reduction of 10% since these studies commenced.  </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office are currently working on the studies for the cohort of people released in 2011 and 2012 and it is anticipated that these reports will be published in the next 6 months.</p></reply>

Changing patterns in drug use that have become evident include a significant shift in use from cannabis resin to cannabis herb. Other notable trends in drug use are the increasing prevalence of poly drug use, often involving a combination of alcohol, traditionally controlled substances and/or new psychoactive substances, and an increasing illicit use of prescription medicines. Crack Cocaine has been noted as present in the Irish drug market for over a decade. Usually associated with people with problematic heroin use, it is becoming a larger problem in some communities recently. </p>  <p>  The expansion of online markets for drugs represents a new and potentially growing challenge, as do changes in synthetic drug and cannabis production. The internet facilitates movement of products, money and information across global borders. Medicines and other substances, including controlled drugs, can be sourced through the darknet and the surface net.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, in partnership with its European counterparts, monitors the sale of all drugs via the internet to identify emerging trends and patterns. In tackling online trade in drugs, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau maintains a liaison with the Enforcement Section of the Health Products Regulatory Authority and with the Customs authorities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the manner in which the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are deployed is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no direct role in this regard. However, I am informed by the Commissioner that the resources coming on stream since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014 has enabled him to assign additional resources to the specialist units that come within the ambit of Special Crime Operations, including the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p>  <p>  I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those within society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities they serve. All Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity, whether it be in the area of drug offence crime or otherwise.  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime. </p>  <p>  The Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for 2019, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year.  The Commissioner has informed me that he intends to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; along with a net 600 Garda Staff (civilian).  The recruitment of these additional Garda Staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy this year a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to the frontline policing duties for which they were trained.   The Government fully supports the Commissioner&rsquo;s management decision which will ensure that increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; are available for frontline duties in the prevention and detection of criminal activity, whether it be in the area of drug offence crime or otherwise, in 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

Garda numbers reached the target of 14,000 by the end of 2018 are on track to reach 15,000 by 2021.  </p><p>The Commissioner has this year been provided with an additional &euro;100 million bringing his budget to almost &euro;1.8 billion which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; next year.  </p><p>The Commissioner has informed me that he intends to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 while in tandem it is his intention to recruit a net 600 Garda Staff (civilians).

The strength of the Reserve as of 31 December 2018 was 530.  However, both the Government and the Garda Commissioner remain committed to increasing the strength of the Garda Reserve and to that end I have been informed by the Commissioner that a training class of approximately 100 Garda Reserves, who successfully applied under previous recruitment drives will commence training in the first quarter of 2019. </p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link: </p></reply>

This compares favourably with 3,130 or 21.7% of the total strength on 31 December 2008.  While this is broadly in line with other police services in England and Wales, there is clearly plenty of scope for improvement.</p><p>In the course of its work the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI) held semi-structured focus group discussions with female Garda members to explore the experiences of female Garda personnel regarding their careers, training and development and future prospects.  Among the recommendations made in the CoFPI report, which the Government adopted in December 2018, is the reform of the current roster and greater flexibility of work practices which would enhance the attractiveness and job satisfaction of a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>In addition, the report also recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society, not only in gender and ethnicity, but also in terms of socio-economic, educational and geographical backgrounds and that they would need to develop recruitment strategies which reach a more diverse intake.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is developing a Garda Diversity and Inclusion Strategy which is at an advanced stage and recognises the importance of recruiting from a wide cross-section of the population so that the organisation provides a policing service that reflects the growing diversity of Irish society. </p><p>A concerted effort is being made to encourage women and minority communities to consider a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that its membership reflects the community that it serves. Recent recruitment campaigns have made a significant effort through on-line videos and other media to attract candidates from minority communities and diverse social groups. In the most recent recruitment campaign a series of videos and text were produced in multiple languages including English, Irish, French, Spanish, Italian and Arabic. They were published on the Garda Facebook page which has more than 180,000 followers.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have attached in tabular form, as requested, the number of women by rank on the 31 December 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available, as supplied by the Commissioner.<table><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Male</th><th>Female </th><th>Female as % of Total</th></tr><tr><td>Commissioner</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Deputy Commissioner</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Commissioner</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>Chief Superintendent</td><td>45</td><td>7</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>Superintendent</td><td>165</td><td>17</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Inspector</td><td>297</td><td>46</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>Sergeant</td><td>1996</td><td>402</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Garda</td><td>11518</td><td>3285</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>14032</td><td>3759</td><td>27%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Very significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021; and investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet over the same period.</p>  <p>  Considerable capital investment is also being made in the Garda estate. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. </p>  <p>  The Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious 5-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities, which continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country, underpinned by over &euro;60 million Exchequer funding as well as a major Public Private Partnership (PPP).  There has been some good progress on the programme in 2018, as well as in other major projects in relation to the Garda estate, including in particular completion and entry into operational use of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters at Wexford, Galway and Kevin Street Dublin, which collectively required funding of over &euro;100 million.

I understand that the designs prepared in that regard by the OPW are currently under consideration by Garda management.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is engaging with the OPW in relation to potential upgrade works at a number of Garda stations in the Kildare Division, including Kildare town, Naas, Newbridge and Kilcock.

This report entitled &ldquo;Review, Evaluation and Analysis of the Operation of the present Irish Prison Service Complaints Procedure&rdquo; is available on my Department's website - .  </p><p>Two of the key recommendations in the Inspector's report are that the complaints category system above be simplified and that prisoners&rsquo; complaints should be subject to review by the Ombudsman, who would also be able to deal with complaints directly in the case of undue delay.  The recommendations in the report were accepted and my officials and officials from the Irish Prison Service have been in advanced discussions with the Ombudsman's office with the aim of establishing an effective complaints system for prisoners. </p><p>In these discussions with the Ombudsman, it has been agreed that his engagement with the process will begin after the new complaints procedure has been introduced and bedded down as an internal IPS process in the first instance.  This IPS process requires administrative supports such as additional personnel, changes to the Prison Rules, drafting of new policy documents and a new ICT system.  Work is well advanced on all of these measures and the IPS expect to introduce the new prisoner complaints system by the third quarter of 2019.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland (EI), has approved funding to enable community groups throughout the country to develop the entrepreneurial talent in their area and support innovative business ideas to create jobs. </p><p>In 2016 Enterprise Ireland awarded &euro;3 million to 32 projects under the Community Enterprise Fund. The goal of this initiative was to stimulate and support enterprise and job creation throughout the country at local, community and regional level.</p><p>Under the current Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), the Government, through EI, awarded &euro;60 million to 42 projects in across all regions to build enterprise capability. This competitive fund had four funding streams, one of which was targeted specifically at local and community enterprise. Under this initiative 7 projects were funded. </p><p>EI funding has also supported the development of a national network of business innovation centres and specialist bio-incubation facilities under the Campus Innovation Programme.  Incubators now exist on every university and Institute of technology Campus in the country.  Such facilities are an important element of public assistance for technology-intensive start-ups, and also an important driver of regional development. The majority of companies who participate in the programme remain in their region after they have completed their incubation period.  </p><p>The centres provide critical space for research-driven start-up companies and make available a wide range of support services and business mentoring.  </p><p>In 2016 EI approved further funding for extensions to three existing Incubation Centres (Athlone Institute of Technology, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology).</p><p>At present there are 1,748 people employed in companies in Enterprise Ireland funded incubation centres.  There are 3 incubation centres in the Border region: </p><p>- IT Sligo (Innovation Centre): currently has 22 companies employing 75 people.</p><p>- Letterkenny IT (CoLab): currently has 32 companies employing 124 people.</p><p>- Dundalk IT (Regional Development Centre): currently has 15 companies employing 87 people.  </p><p>EI has co-funded, with local enterprise development groups, 157 Community Enterprise Centres across the country totaling &euro;64 million. There is now a Community Enterprise Centre located in every county. The agency has also provided &euro;2m, via competitive funding, to support the role of  46 Business Development Function/Managers in Community Enterprise Centres. These centers collectively employ approximately 6,000 people across 1,200 companies and are key hubs of enterprise activity in many areas.</p></reply>

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that programme includes plans for an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU) at Knockaconny, County Monaghan. The IDA are currently in the process of procuring a design and delivery team for this facility.</p>  <p>  More broadly, I want to emphasise that creating jobs in the regions is a priority for both the IDA and my Department. I am focused on doing everything I can to deliver the most even possible spread of investment across the country. The resources we have invested into regional growth is, as the evidence illustrates, producing results. In 2018, for example, the IDA delivered 113 regional investments with 56% of net new jobs created outside Dublin. The last four years have seen over 44,000 new foreign direct investment-supported jobs created outside the capital. We will continue to do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland, including Monaghan, in the time ahead. </p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>   The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>   In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Screening tests are a balance of sensitivity and specificity and therefore include both false negative and false positive results which could affect the screening outcome and treatment of a person who may or who may not have a disease. False negatives are those samples where the slide was originally reported as negative but on review abnormal cells are found.  As outlined in the report of the Scoping Inquiry, some screening programmes divide those false negatives into one of two groups:</p>  <p>  1. Abnormalities that most screeners would not have detected;</p>  <p>  2. Abnormalities that most screeners would have detected.</p>  <p>  It is often a matter for professional judgement and discussion into which of these two groups any single false negative will fit.  Following the Government decision on 8 May, I established an independent Expert Panel Review of Cervical Screening as part of the investigation into issues relating to the CervicalCheck Screening Programme.  The review will be carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) with expertise also sourced through the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the review is to provide women who participated in the national CervicalCheck screening programme and who developed invasive cervical cancer with independent clinical assurance about the timing of their diagnosis and treatment. The panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage and will prepare individual written summary reports for those affected, setting out the facts and their expert and independent assessment of those facts.</p></reply>

The HPV test is a more accurate testing mechanism than liquid-based cytology, which is the current testing mechanism, and its use will result in fewer false negative results, though it will not eliminate them completely. Its introduction is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally. </p>  <p>  The introduction of HPV testing as the primary screening mechanism for CervicalCheck, with cytology as a reflex test, will require a reconfiguration of the laboratory work involved. A tendering process will be required for work to be carried out outside the public sector, and detailed capacity planning is ongoing to determine requirements. </p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the issues which emerged last year have resulted in operational challenges for the HSE and the Screening Service, and that stabilisation of the programme in 2019 is an important element in supporting the switch to HPV testing. Accordingly, the HSE is working very actively to manage these challenges while progressing this major development as a priority.  </p>  <p>  Funding to implement the switch to HPV screening has been allocated in Budget 2019, along with funding to implement the recommendations of Dr Gabriel Scally&rsquo;s inquiry in to the CervicalCheck Screening Programme and the extension of HPV vaccination to boys, illustrating the Government&rsquo;s commitment to these essential projects.</p></reply>

My officials are working closely with colleagues in other Departments and agencies across the public service to develop a joint approach in relation to the implementation at ports and airports of import controls on products coming from the UK. In July 2018, and again in September 2018, a number of decisions were made at Cabinet relating to Brexit preparedness and contingency planning, including the phased recruitment of staff, as required. The Government has already sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  The aforementioned requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. The Department has carried out an extensive analysis exercise, based on examination of trade and container movement data, together with close consultation with stakeholder organisations and individual companies, to establish as best we can the likely volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This has been a difficult exercise, given the lack of detailed data as a result of the UK&rsquo;s participation in the Single Market up to this point, but we have based our assumptions and planning on what we believe are reasonable estimates of the likely volumes.</p>  <p>  On staffing, we have used this data analysis exercise to guide our planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required to carry out the range of controls needed. These controls are carried out by a combination of portal inspectorate staff and where necessary, the appropriate veterinary and technical supervision, as well as administrative staff not located at the ports. The Department is working closely with Customs and others to provide the resources needed to apply the necessary controls.  </p>  <p>  In general, the Department will look to recruit and redeploy as well as engage temporary flexible solutions where appropriate and as necessary. Veterinary supervision will be provided with respect to products of animal origin by a combination of: veterinary inspectors currently on recruitment panels, where we are in the process of engaging with 37 remaining on current panels; new recruitment competitions; redeployment within the department on a temporary basis if necessary and the possible engagement of contracted service arrangements as required.</p>  <p>  The Department is also drawing from a pool of applicants for Portal Inspector posts and from redeployed volunteers from within the Department to conduct some of the necessary checks. Candidates for these roles will be interviewed in February to provide capacity in Dublin Port and Rosslare for the engagement of 70 Clerical Portal Inspectors, and a significant pool of additional applicants is available for interview as needed.</p>  <p>  The Department can also draw from a pool of applicants for Technical Agricultural Officers for plant health checks. The Department continue to engage with PAS re the aforementioned options as well as other required grades such as Assistant Agricultural Officers as well as back up administrative staff in traditional administrative civil service grades.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am confident that the State will be in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

Irish fur farmers are, in this regard, subject to the same animal welfare legislation as other livestock farmers. </p><p>A review of all aspects of fur farming in Ireland was commissioned in November 2011. The Terms of Reference of the Review Group were:</p><p>(i) To review fur farming in Ireland taking into account existing legislative provisions for the licensing of mink farming;  </p><p>(ii) To comment on the economic benefits of the sector; </p><p>(iii) To consider the effectiveness of existing welfare controls, and </p><p>(iv) To make appropriate recommendations </p><p>The Review Group invited submissions from the public and interested parties and considered over four hundred submissions which were received.</p><p>The Group concluded that it did not find the arguments in favour of banning the farming of fur animals in Ireland compelling and recommended that instead, fur farming be allowed continue under licence and subject to official control. I accept the findings of the review group and its recommendations.</p><p>On foot of the Review Group&rsquo;s deliberations, my Department introduced more rigorous controls on licence holders in the areas of animal welfare, animal accommodation, security and nutrient management. Licensees are subject to regular inspections, including unannounced inspections by Department officials. </p><p>Notwithstanding the position in other countries, given the recommendations from the review group, there are no plans to introduce a ban on fur farming. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 135,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.</p>  <p>  The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding, focusing eligibility to those in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, such as the Fuel Allowance, and limiting each home to one visit for an energy efficiency upgrade. Last year, the scheme was expanded. Subject to survey by SEAI and assessment of potential for improved energy performance, the scheme can, in certain circumstances, include internal or external wall insulation. This will permit the upgrade of more property types such as homes with solid walls, and also increase the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve and will also enable future fuel switching.</p>  <p>  Demand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting the shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these type of works and the delivery capacity of SEAI&rsquo;s contractor panel. The construction market is currently under pressure to deliver new homes as well. </p>  <p>  The measures offered under the scheme are currently being reviewed again in light of new Building Regulations coming into force later this year. Any works carried out under the scheme will need to comply with the requirements set out under those regulations, while also taking account of the budget available to the scheme.</p>  <p>  While homes that previously received works under the scheme are not currently eligible for a second visit, consideration will be given to revisiting these properties later in 2019, where feasible and appropriate.</p></reply>

This Directive provides for sharing of information on road traffic offences between EU Member States.  Under the Directive, law enforcement authorities in each Member State may use vehicle registrations to check for records of offences in other Member States.  </p>  <p>  Ireland transposed the Directive in question by means of the European Union (Facilitation of Cross-Border Exchange of Information on Road-Safety-Related Traffic Offences) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 371 of 2017).  Furthermore, my Department, in conjunction with EU authorities, put in place the necessary IT connections to enable the operation of exchanges of data under the Directive.  </p>  <p>  The actual making of outgoing requests is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that of making incoming requests is, obviously, a matter for law-enforcement in other Member States.</p>  <p>  The question of possible infringement relates to the formal submission to the EU Commission of a report on exchanges that have taken place under the Directive, rather than to compliance with any of the substantive requirements of the Directive.

In these cases the only exercise the Adoption Authority could carry out was to ascertain if an adoption record existed and to carry out a cross referencing exercise with the GRO. Based on this process there was a suspicion of illegal birth registrations, but it was not possible for the Adoption Authority of Ireland to carry out the same rigorous process as Tusla to be as sure as possible that these individuals' births were in fact illegally registered.</p><p>I  understand that a detailed review of these suspected cases is still ongoing and there are some data protection concerns which are being addressed in this regard. Part of the exercise will be to cross reference the cases against the already confirmed cases<b>. </b></p><p>However there is no guarantee that in these cases any records exist and if they do, that the required level of evidence exists that will allow a definitive conclusion that an illegal registration has taken place.  </p><p>To clarify, it was only when the records of the former Adoption Society St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild (SPG) were transferred to Tusla that it identified evidence of the practice of illegal birth registrations on index cards created and maintained by SPG.  If the marker &lsquo;adopted from birth&rsquo; had not been present on the index cards it would have been extremely difficult to identify even the cases that have been found so far.</p><p>When Tusla confirmed to the Department that it had identified 126 cases where births were illegally registered from the SPG records, it had been in a position to complete a rigorous process using these records to be as sure as possible that these individuals' births were in fact illegally registered.</p><p>Given the potentially life changing implications of notifying people that they have been the subject of an illegal birth registration, the State must have a high level of certainty that an illegal registration has in fact occurred, before informing them.  This threshold was reached in the case of the 126 SPG files.</p></reply>

Projects funded by the Department are far below the threshold of a major project with, for example, the public spending code requiring cost benefit assessment or cost effectiveness assessment for capital projects valued at over &euro;20 million.

All jobseekers in receipt of a Jobseeker's payment from my Department are required to be available for and seeking full time employment. </p>  <p>  In the case of clients already in part-time employment, the JobPath service will focus on any options or opportunities to increase the level of employment in their current role, or look at possibilities in other areas, which could involve some training, but would provide a more sustainable income and a move away from a jobseeker's payment. It is important therefore that these jobseekers continue to engage with their JobPath provider. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the JobPath service can arrange job search activities and meetings with personal advisors to take account of work schedules, jobseekers are advised to inform their personal advisor on an ongoing basis of their work commitments and the JobPath contractors are required to be flexible in the provision of the service in that respect.  </p>  <p>  In regard to the individual case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned was referred to the JobPath Service on 23/3/18 and was in part time employment at that time.  He was unable to attend a number of meetings with his personal advisor in October 2018 and as the JobPath contractor had not been provided with details of his work schedule for those weeks, they notified the Department of his non-attendance.  </p>  <p>  All decisions regarding the application of sanctions for failure to engage with activation services are a matter for the Department and in this case a penalty rate was applied to his payment for two weeks from 17th October to 30th October 2018.  In order to review the application of the sanction in this case, an official from the Intreo Centre will make contact with the jobseeker shortly to determine the facts and will also answer any queries he may have regarding part time work and engagement with the JobPath service. </p></reply>

Many of the provisions contained within the Directive will support positive reform of the Irish occupational pension sector.  The Directive provides for a range of new requirements concerning governance, management standards in schemes, safekeeping of assets, the need for clear and relevant information to members, the removal of obstacles to cross-border provision of pension services and the facilitation of cross border transfer of schemes.  There are also provisions that will enhance the powers of the Pensions Authority for effective supervision of occupational pensions.   </p>  <p>  The IORP II Directive was the result of almost three years of discussion and negotiation and came into force on 12 January 2017.  Officials in my Department, supported by the Pensions Authority, are managing the transposition process of the IORP II Directive.  This is a substantial Directive and preparation of regulations to transpose the Directive are at an advanced stage.  It is expected that transposition into Irish law will be achieved later this quarter.  This timeframe is in keeping with many other EU countries.  National transposition measures communicated by the Member States to the Commission concerning the Directive are available online on one of the Commission's web sites and the list is updated weekly.  No such notifications were published on that website when Parliamentary Question No. 648 was responded to.  Since then, and as of 28th January 2019, ten countries have been reported as notifying the Commission of transposing measures.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Work is continuing on the draft guidance, which is expected to be submitted for finalisation to the MoP by the ad hoc working group in December 2020. The progress of the ad hoc working group on this matter will be discussed at the upcoming Intermediary Session of the MoP in February 2019.</p>  <p>  As it is not yet clear whether lifetime extensions of nuclear power plants engage the requirements of the Espoo Convention, I have no function in relation to the public consultation concerned, which is for the French public and not a transboundary consultation with other States or Parties to the Convention. My Department has therefore consulted with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) on this matter as responsibility at national level for nuclear policy and radiological protection is within the remit of DCCAE.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's established position is that, while not a nuclear energy producing country, we acknowledge the right of States to determine their own energy mix. However, we expect that, where a State chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this will be done in line with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection.  </p>  <p>  The issue of ageing nuclear power plant infrastructure is closely monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the general regulatory requirements to be applied by national competent authorities in relation to the approval and operation of nuclear power plants within the EU is set out in the EU Nuclear Safety Directive.</p>  <p>  Officials from both my Department and from DCCAE will attend the upcoming Intermediary Session of the Espoo Convention MoP in February 2019.</p></reply>
