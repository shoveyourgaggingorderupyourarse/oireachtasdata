It is this system which generates the data which is used by NOAC in its performance reports. </p>  <p>  The objective of the MapRoad pavement management system and the NOAC reports is to provide the data needed for evidence-based prioritisation and management of road work programmes by each road authority.  Work is continuing to improve the system.</p>  <p>  Thirdly, my Department&rsquo;s Road Inspectorate has been strengthened significantly over the last year which means that there is now more extensive engagement with road authorities, enhancing oversight of the regional and local road investment programme. </p></reply>

Over 11,500 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.</p>  <p>  The 2018 round of the programme opened for applications on 7th September and all applications must be submitted by the 19th of October. Officials from my Department are always willing to discuss existing grants or potential applications with sports clubs and groups. Organisations who receive a grant and subsequently wish to use the funding awarded for a different purpose can be accommodated so long as the revised purpose is consistent with the original application and the general terms and conditions of the SCP. Numerous such requests have been accommodated in the past across all counties. Any club considering changing the purpose of a grant should contact the SCP division of my Department in the first instance. </p>  <p>  It is also open to any organisation with an existing grant to apply for funding under the 2018 round of the SCP for new sports capital works or sports equipment.  While the amount of funding received in the past is factored into the score obtained at assessment stage, applicants with an existing SCP grant do not need to have any approval from the Department prior to making a new application.</p></reply>

The review was conducted as a direct response to the Air Accident Investigation Unit interim statement of March last which called on me to carry out a thorough review of SAR aviation operations in Ireland to ensure that there are appropriate processes, resources and personnel in place to provide effective, continuous, comprehensive and independent oversight of all aspects of these operations.  The report has been prepared by a team of external, international experts in this area. The review has also benefitted from a peer review by other jurisdictions including Australia, Finland, Iceland and Spain. I have considered the report and I accept in full the 12 recommendations contained in it.  </p>  <p>  The review process was completed in August. As this review is part of the AAIU&rsquo;s wider investigative process, I submitted the report to the AAIU, together with a series of actions to ensure full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. While I am keen to publish the report as soon as possible, I have also been conscious that its publication could have unintended implications for other aspects of the AAIU&rsquo;s on-going investigation and therefore I have been careful not to do anything to jeopardise their work in any way.  </p>  <p>  This process is now almost complete, subject to a small number of clarifications sought from the Review Team.  </p>  <p>  As a direct follow-up, I have instructed all parties involved &ndash; both within my Department and the IAA - that all necessary steps be taken without delay to ensure speedy implementation of all of the recommendations.   </p>  <p>  I am more than happy to arrange for Deputy Troy and Deputy Munster, who I appreciate have been consistent in their demands for a full and comprehensive response to all matters arising from the tragedy that is R116, to be briefed by my Department on the full details of the Report and the plan to implement its recommendations once it is published.</p></reply>

This programme will provide safe alternative active travel routes that will help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure. Details of individual projects are managed by the National Transport Authority. </p>  <p>  Turning to the specific query raised by the Deputy concerning the provision of the greenway between Naas, Sallins and Ardclough, I am advised by the NTA that it has allocated funding to Kildare County Council (KCC) to progress 3 cycle schemes through the design phase, including the Naas-Sallins cycleway project first. This project proposes to provide a pedestrian and cycle route from Newbridge Road to Naas Harbour to Sallins train station. The project is at the Preliminary Design stage and the NTA awaits KCC and their Consultant to deliver that design for approval, prior to public consultation.</p>  <p>  Beyond this, the Deputy may be aware that currently the Grand Canal has a dedicated cycling and walking route along the canal from Inchicore to the R120; South Dublin County Council (SDCC) has commenced  feasibility work (with their consultant) to extend the cycleway from the R120 to the Hazelhatch Road (where collaboration with KCC will be required).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-19a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091900063#WRA02200"><p>Recent reports show that approximately 70% of people travelling into Dublin city each morning do so by sustainable transport. Well over half of all the public transport trips are by bus; some 136 million passenger journeys annually.  It is no surprise then that Bus is the main component of the planned approach to addressing our current congestion problem and to meeting our future transport needs. </p>  <p>  As those numbers grow, and as congestion worsens, it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate a reliable bus system with sufficient capacity to cater for the needs of the region. On the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are currently only in place for less than one third of the corridor.  This means that for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.</p>  <p>  Against this context, the NTA are progressing the roll-out of BusConnects commencing in Dublin. BusConnects Dublin provides the foundation to this overall transport system, with the revised bus system projected to carry the majority of passengers across the region and provide key linkages to serve the needs of Dublin into the future.</p>  <p>  BusConnects Dublin aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by:</p>  <p>  - building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus routes to make bus journeys for passengers faster, predictable and reliable;</p>  <p>  - completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide passengers with a more efficient network, connecting more places and carrying more people;</p>  <p>  - developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit and debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and making payment much more convenient for the travelling public;</p>  <p>  - implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up passenger boarding times;</p>  <p>  - revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure;</p>  <p>  - allowing seamless movement for passengers between different public transport services, without financial penalty;</p>  <p>  - implementing a new bus livery providing a modern look and feel to the new bus system;</p>  <p>  - rolling out new bus stops with better signage and passenger information, and increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and</p>  <p>  - transitioning - starting now - to a new bus fleet using  low-emission vehicle technologies.  </p>  <p>  NTA are aware that maximising the potential of the BusConnects project means enabling more people to use the bus services instead of private cars. For those travelling longer distances, the optimum strategy is a park and ride arrangement, where they can make part of the journey by car, then leave the car in a dedicated car park and complete the journey by bus. For people travelling longer distances, often the optimum strategy can be a park and ride arrangement, where they can make part of the journey by car, then leave the car in a dedicated car park and complete the journey by public transport.  Bus-based Park and Ride needs careful siting of the car parks, coupled with a high frequency of bus service, to operate successfully. Ideally, the location of the parking facilities should be just outside the area of congestion and conveniently located for car users on the particular corridor</p>  <p>  As part of BusConnects, a network of park and ride facilities will be developed at key locations along the radial road network. Indicative locations were published in 2017 on the basis that these would be subject to more detailed assessment as part of the project&rsquo;s delivery and may change and that additional locations may be added. In June, the National Transport Authority published the Core Bus Corridors Project report setting out the outline of 16 radial routes, together with 200km of cycling lanes, into and out of the city. In October of this year NTA expect to publish the detailed and considered proposals for each of the 16 corridors. At that stage a full public consultation process will commence. This will allow people to provide feedback and their thoughts on the proposals and the NTA will fully engage with people along the corridors and surrounding areas. Once this phase is complete and the design finalised, NTA will turn their attention to confirming the detail of network of park and ride facilities will be developed at key locations along the radial road network.</p>  <p>  To conclude, it is envisaged that BusConnects will deliver a bus system, fully integrated with Park and Ride facilities to ensure a seamless connection between the parking facility and the bus system,  that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.</p></reply>

This has included the provision of cross-city services, increased frequency on existing services and new services linking residential areas to places of employment and education. Further investment has been made in the city bus fleet which is 100% fully accessible and an increase in capacity through the purchase and deployment of double deck buses.</p>  <p>  In relation to the area raised by the Deputy, Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that in conjunction with the NTA, they are in the final stages of producing a wide range of significant services enhancements on the Ballingcollig - City Centre - Carragaline Corridor in Cork City and its environs.  These changes will see significant increases in service frequency and hours of operation across a number of routes including Route 220 and Route 220X which operates from Ballincollig - City Centre - Carragaline.  These planned changes will see the current 3 buses per hour from Ballincollig &amp;amp; Carragaline increase to 5 buses per hour - an increase of 66% in hourly departures. These changes will be supplemented by the deployment of additional double deck buses along the route to further increase service capacity.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new range of local services will also be introduced that will ensure that Passage/Monkstown are linked to Carragline and Passage/Monkstown and Fountainstown are linked directly to the Carragaline Primary Care Centre.  Carragaline will be linked to both Ringaskiddy &amp;amp; Cork Airport for the first time.  I am advised that the timetables for these local services are currently being finalised with the NTA.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Regarding Route 223 I am advised that this route will be fully reviewed once the significant changes in relation to the other routes are implemented.</p></reply>

They are both in listening mode to people who have suggestions as to how these plans can be made even better.  The public consultation process will run until 28th September and presents a great opportunity for people to have their say before the plans are finalised by the NTA. The NTA expect to publish the finding from the public consultation phase before the year end. </p>  <p>  As part of the consultation process, I am advised that the NTA has also engaged with disability groups, facilitated by the National Disability Authority, with regard to the BusConnects proposals. The NTA understand that the issue of interchange is more difficult for elderly people and people with disabilities.  Accordingly, it intends to make changes between services as seamless as possible and they are planning that each key interchange location will have a bus shelter, seating, lighting and passenger information.  Where bus routes intersect at a junction, the bus stops will be moved as close as possible to the junction to minimise any walking required during the bus interchange, and pedestrian crossings will be added where necessary.</p>  <p>  Recent reports show that approximately 70% of people travelling into Dublin city each morning do so by sustainable transport. Well over half of all the public transport trips are by bus; some 136 million passenger journeys annually.  It is no surprise then that Bus is the main component of the planned approach to addressing our current congestion problem and to meeting our future transport needs. </p>  <p>  As those numbers grow, and as congestion worsens, it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate a reliable bus system with sufficient capacity to cater for the needs of the region. On the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are only in place for less than one third of the corridor.  This means that for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.</p>  <p>  BusConnects Dublin aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by:</p>  <p>  - building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus routes to make bus journeys for passengers faster, predictable and reliable;</p>  <p>  - completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide passengers with a more efficient network, connecting more places and carrying more people;</p>  <p>  - developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit and debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and making payment much more convenient for the travelling public;</p>  <p>  - implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up passenger boarding times;</p>  <p>  - revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure;</p>  <p>  - allowing seamless movement for passengers between different public transport services, without financial penalty;</p>  <p>  - implementing a new bus livery providing a modern look and feel to the new bus system;</p>  <p>  - rolling out new bus stops with better signage and passenger information, and increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and</p>  <p>  - transitioning - starting now - to a new bus fleet using low-emission vehicle technologies.</p>  <p>  Last month the National Transport Authority (NTA) published the &ldquo;Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign Public Consultation Report&rdquo;. This report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin is very complex, is designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes taking people into the city centre, but with very few orbital routes. Recent improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to the bus services to exploit their full potential. Finally the city is growing and changing as are the bus journeys people are taking.</p>  <p>  The report identifies 4 key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals and grow suburban feeder networks. </p>  <p>  While there will be concerns with any change, these strategies will deliver many benefits for the customer; much simpler city services; much simpler fare structure; provide more frequent all day services through new and frequent orbital services interchanging with local services and high frequency radial spines. </p>  <p>  Under these proposals, an overall increase in services of 27% is expected, which as far as customers are concerned, can only be a good thing. The NTA estimate that  of people who currently have a direct service to the city centre about 92% will continue to have a direct service under the new bus proposals.  </p>  <p>  To conclude, it is envisaged that BusConnects will deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, support the elderly and people with disabilities in their travel,  and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.</p></reply>

The NTA understand that the issue of interchange is more difficult for elderly people and people with disabilities.  Accordingly, it intends to make changes between services as seamless as possible.  NTA are planning that each key interchange location will have a bus shelter, seating, lighting and passenger information.  Where bus routes intersect at a junction, the bus stops will be moved as close as possible to the junction to minimise any walking required during the bus interchange, and pedestrian crossings will be added where necessary.</p>  <p>  While the proposed network is a significant opportunity to continue the growth of bus services, it will be a huge change for everyone in the city. However, the objective of the proposals is to provide a bus service that is easier to use, understand and more attractive to customers and to potential customers - to make the network more efficient, with frequent services and access to more places.  While there will be concerns with any change, these strategies will deliver many benefits for the customer; much simpler city services; much simpler fare structure; provide more frequent all day services through new and frequent orbital services interchanging with local services and high frequency radial spines. </p>  <p>  I am aware of concerns raised by people at the Information roadshows and at local meetings. Area specific issues raised at public consultation will be looked at again by both the NTA and Dublin Bus when the consultation period is over. While the proposed network is a significant opportunity to continue the growth of bus services, it will be a huge change for everyone in the city. However, the objective of the proposals is to provide a bus service that is easier to use, understand and more attractive to customers and to potential customers - to make the network more efficient, with frequent services and access to more places. </p>  <p>  To conclude, it is envisaged that BusConnects will deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.</p></reply>

Over 300 submissions were received in response to that consultation process. </p>  <p>  A report of those submissions has been submitted to my Department by the NTA and I intend to bring the report to Government for consideration.</p>  <p>  It is my intention that the NTA's report on the consultation would be published by the NTA following consideration by Government. In advance of that, no decisions have been taken regarding matters such as the future of individual rail lines.</p>  <p>  I have stated previously that there are no plans for the closure of any parts of the rail network. The Taoiseach has also given assurances in the D&aacute;il in recent months that there are no plans in this regard. </p>  <p>  Regarding the financial performance of the company, according to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's most recently published financial statements the company incurred a deficit of &euro;1.1 million in 2017, which was lower than the deficit of &euro;2.9 million that was incurred in the previous year. The continued recovery of our national economy has resulted in increased passenger journeys and consequent growth in passenger revenue for Irish Rail.</p>  <p>  All debt (in the form of external third party borrowings) within the CI&Eacute; group of companies is held by CI&Eacute; holding company. As Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is a wholly owned subsidiary of CI&Eacute; holding company, there is no debt (in the form of external third party borrowings) currently held by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's query on safety, the strong record of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in this regard is acknowledged by the European Union Agency for Railways' review of safety performance and by the Commission for Railway Regulation.</p>  <p>  The Commission's most recent Railway Safety Performance in Ireland report, in December 2017, stated that "The safety performance of our principal railway organisations in 2016 was, on the whole, positive, particularly given the backdrop of increased passenger numbers on both Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and on the Luas." </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the National Development Plan identifies a number of key investment priorities for the inter-urban rail network.  These include, for example, the ongoing programme of investment to protect that investment already made in the national rail system through maintenance and renewal activities, including such projects as the National Train Control Centre and the City Centre Resignalling Project.</p>  <p>  The Infrastructure Multi Annual Manager Contract (IMMAC) is the contractual arrangement between my Department and Irish Rail for the channelling of Exchequer funds for investment in railway infrastructure, safety, asset renewal and maintenance in order to protect the quality of service and investments already made.  &euro;160m of Exchequer funding is allocated this year to Irish Rail under the IMMAC contract.</p></reply>

This was particularly the case when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in terms of its ability to fund infrastructure directly, given their use of private finance, on an off-balance sheet basis. This enabled projects to proceed which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of Exchequer funding alone.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future and given the significant increase in planned Exchequer capital investment over the coming years, which will see public investment in Ireland as a share of national income moving to among the highest in the EU, the PPP review concluded that PPPs can play a very important role in the delivery of public capital investment projects contained in the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  Noting the benefits that PPPs can deliver, the review recommended that PPPs remain as an effective procurement option for appropriate public capital investment projects within the suite of capital investment mechanisms available to Departments. It is important that PPPs should be assessed on a level-playing field basis as compared to traditional procurement. All large-scale projects included in the new National Development Plan should, therefore, continue to be assessed in terms of suitability for procurement by PPP and/or alternative financing, in particular projects which involve user charges or which offer the potential to generate significant third party income. </p>  <p>  It is essential that these projects continue to be judged on their merits and if PPPs offer better value-for-money than traditional procurement, I would encourage that they are considered and selected on that basis.</p></reply>

Over the period leading up to 2027, the NDP will deliver the new Metrolink, the DART Expansion Programme, and BusConnects Dublin. </p>  <p>  The NDP also includes maintenance of the current Public Transport network, fleet renewal, maintaining and upgrading heavy rail infrastructure, the appraisal and design of extending the Luas network for when and where it is needed, investment in cycling and walking facilities, accessibility upgrades, and the roll out of next generation ticketing systems. </p>  <p>  The delivery of increased capacity, improved service quality, and greater choice in terms of Public Transport, as well as making it easier and safer for people to walk and cycle, will reduce the need for commuters to drive as their primary form of transport. Providing an attractive alternative to drivers is one of the main ways that traffic congestion in Dublin can be relieved.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority meets regularly with the relevant local authorities and public transport service providers to monitor and react to traffic issues in the city and its environs, and to identify and implement service improvements. Improvements in traffic congestion require a combination of some short term measures together with a substantial programme of medium and longer term projects that will deliver sustainable alternative transport options and increased capacity.</p>  <p>  The traveling public should see the initial benefits of the bus service redesign as part of BusConnects early in 2020.  The first benefits of the DART Expansion Programme will be seen by 2022, when the fully-electrified DART line will be extended to Balbriggan, unlocking potential for increased high-frequency and higher-speed services. </p>  <p>  The M1 corridor will significantly benefit from these investments. Though the full BusConnects programme is currently at the public consultation stage, it is expected that a core bus corridor will be developed between Swords and the city centre, to allow for faster and more efficient bus travel. The emerging preferred route of Metrolink, which is also at the public consultation stage, would see the north-south urban railway service run between Swords and Sandyford, connecting key destinations including Dublin Airport. It will deliver 25 minute journeys from Swords to the city centre, and 20 minute journeys from Dublin Airport to the city centre. Meanwhile, the DART Expansion Programme will see the DART extend to Balbriggan by 2022 and onwards to Drogheda in the following years. A series of strategically-positioned park and ride facilities will be developed alongside these investments, to open up their benefits to a wider geographical area. </p></reply>

Accessibility features, such as wheelchair access, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage. </p>  <p>  The increase in funding for the retro-fit programme will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet. </p>  <p>  I intend to improve upon that under the National Development Plan (NDP) over the next ten years and beyond. Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated, accessible and sustainable national public transport system. A number of key new major public transport programmes are proposed to be delivered under the NDP over the period to 2027 and these will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. In addition, there will be continued investment in the retro-fit programme under the NDP.</p></reply>

While Ireland is in favour of the UK remaining on this Corridor and part of TEN-T, if that is not possible, we support the Commission&rsquo;s preparations as this will ensure that the integrity of the Corridor is maintained, and that Ireland is not geographically isolated from the rest of the Corridor post Brexit.

Well over half of all the public transport trips are by bus; some 136 million passenger journeys annually.  It is no surprise then that Bus is the main component of the planned approach to addressing our current congestion problem and to meeting our future transport needs. </p>  <p>  As those numbers grow, and as congestion worsens, it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate a reliable bus system with sufficient capacity to cater for the needs of the region. On the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are only in place for less than one third of the corridor.  This means that for most of the journey, buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.</p>  <p>  Against this context, the NTA are progressing the roll-out of BusConnects commencing in Dublin. BusConnects Dublin provides the foundation to this overall transport system, with the revised bus system projected to carry the majority of passengers across the region and provide key linkages to serve the needs of Dublin into the future.</p>  <p>  BusConnects Dublin aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by: </p>  <p>  - building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus routes to make bus journeys for passengers faster, predictable and reliable; </p>  <p>  - completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide passengers with a more efficient network, connecting more places and carrying more people;</p>  <p>  - developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit and debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and making payment much more convenient for the travelling public;</p>  <p>  - implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up passenger boarding times;</p>  <p>  - revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure;</p>  <p>  - allowing seamless movement for passengers between different public transport services, without financial penalty;</p>  <p>  - implementing a new bus livery providing a modern look and feel to the new bus system;</p>  <p>  - rolling out new bus stops with better signage and passenger information and increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and</p>  <p>  - transitioning - starting now - to a new bus fleet using low-emission vehicle technologies.</p>  <p>  As well as providing many benefits to exisiting and future bus customers, BusConnects Dublin is calculated to also provide over 200km of cycle lanes as an integral element of the scheme.</p>  <p>   In July the National Transport Authority (NTA) published the &ldquo;Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign Public Consultation Report&rdquo;. This report notes that the existing bus network in Dublin is very complex, is designed primarily around overlapping and long radial routes taking people into the city centre, but with very few orbital routes. Recent improvements to the rail and tram networks require changes to the bus services to exploit their full potential. Finally the city is growing and changing as are the bus journeys people are taking.</p>  <p>  The report identifies 4 key strategies to address the issues with the current network: standardise service categories; simplify radial services; build frequent orbitals and grow suburban feeder networks. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the NTA supported by Dublin Bus have embarked on a process of full public consultation  on these bus proposals involving local brochures, local face to face events organised at various locations around the city, digital imaging of the network, on-line surveys and consultation with user groups. They are both  listening to people who have suggestions as to how these plans can be made even better.  The public consultation process will run until 28th September and presents a great opportunity for people to have their say before the plans are finalised by the NTA. The NTA expect to publish the finding from the public consultation phase before the year end. </p>  <p>  As part of the consultation process, I am advised that the NTA has also engaged with disability groups, facilitated by the National Disability Authority, with regard to the BusConnects proposals. The NTA understand that the issue of interchange is more difficult for elderly people and people with disabilities.  Accordingly, it intends to make changes between services as seamless as possible.  NTA are planning that each key interchange location will have a bus shelter, seating, lighting and passenger information.  Where bus routes intersect at a junction, the bus stops will be moved as close as possible to the junction to minimise any walking required during the bus interchange, and pedestrian crossings will be added where necessary.</p>  <p>   I understand an overall increase in services of 27% is expected, which as far as customers are concerned, can only be a good thing.  The NTA estimate that, of people who currently have a direct service to the city centre, 92% will continue to have such a service under the new proposals. </p>  <p>  I am well aware of concerns raised by people at the Information roadshows and at local meetings. Area specific issues raised at public consultation will be looked at again by both the NTA and Dublin Bus when the consultation period is over. While the proposed network is a significant opportunity to continue the growth of bus services, it will be a huge change for everyone in the city. However, the objective of the proposals is to provide a bus service that is easier to use, understand and more attractive to customers and to potential customers - to make the network more efficient, with frequent services and access to more places.</p>  <p>  To conclude, BusConnects is an innovative proposal that is getting people to think about how they travel.  I am satisfied  that BusConnects will deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme taking available grant funding and its own resources into account. I always stress to Councils the importance of prioritising roads when allocating their own resources.</p>  <p>  Grant allocations for 2019 will be decided after the 2019 Estimates process is concluded. Within the budget available to the Department, the approach taken is to allocate funding on as fair and equitable basis as possible.

Issues raised in relation to the risk assessment were then clarified at meetings that took place between the relevant officials after that date.</p>  <p>  I gave my consent to the transfer on 11 July and Minister/PER (as a Shareholder) gave his consent on 17 July and signed the Order for transfer.  The Order was sent to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in mid-July.</p></reply>

Contingency planning for a no-deal outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, was identified as an early priority and is now well advanced.  Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome.  It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. </p>  <p>  This work has provided baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations.  This is enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement, including a transitional arrangement, is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  On 18 July I presented a detailed Memorandum to the Government on Brexit Preparedness and Contingency Planning.  The Memorandum included elements aimed at moving from planning to implementation in a number of key areas and the Government requested detailed follow-up proposals, including in regard to the recruitment of customs officers and staff responsible for sanitary and phytosanitary checks.  I presented a further update to Government on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning on 18 September.</p>  <p>  Relevant Departments have now been tasked by the Government, on the basis of existing work, to rollout detailed Action Plans with a view to advancing, as appropriate, the mitigating measures which have been identified in the areas of their responsibility from the planning to the implementation phase.  </p>  <p>  All of this work is in addition to measures that have already been put in place to get Ireland Brexit ready.  Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector.  Capital expenditure of &euro;116bn over the coming decade under Project Ireland 2040 will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead.  There was also increased funding provided to my Department in Budget 2018 for the opening of six new diplomatic missions.  The first two of these have commenced operations in recent weeks.  A further seven new Missions will be opened as part of the next phase of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint.  These thirteen new Missions will be located in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania and will contribute to helping develop new markets for Ireland&rsquo;s exports.</p>  <p>  Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit - making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.  In total 51 reports analysing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments.  All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work at home, we are engaging actively with the European Commission&rsquo;s Article 50 Taskforce and its Brexit Preparedness Unit on areas where the lead policy role lies with the EU. </p></reply>

I hope that the inquest will proceed without any further delay and provide the families with the answers that they are still seeking after forty-seven years. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the documentaries on the killings that took place in Ballymurphy in August 1971, which are an important contribution to remembrance and understanding of those terrible events.</p>  <p>  I have directed my Department to monitor developments with the case and my officials to remain in regular contact with the families. </p>  <p>  There are many other victims&rsquo; families that are also still seeking truth and justice, often decades after their loss. </p>  <p>  Dealing with outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the Troubles is of the utmost importance to the Government, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p>  <p>  Regarding legacy inquests in Northern Ireland, I have consistently emphasised in my discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the political parties the need to ensure proper resourcing of these inquests, and I continue to raise this matter with the Secretary of State.  I have urged all those with responsibilities in relation to legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible with the implementation of the proposals made by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland in this regard.  The Government is continuing to seek urgent progress on this matter.</p>  <p>  I have also engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with all of the political parties to support a way forward on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework.  Secretary of State Bradley and I are agreed on the imperative of now moving ahead with the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework.</p>  <p>  On 11 May, I welcomed the launch of a public consultation by the British Government on their draft legislation to establish the legacy bodies provided for in the Stormont House Agreement.  This is an important step in the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement.  While that consultation is about UK legislation to establish the institutions, legislation will also be required in this jurisdiction to provide for cooperation with the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies.  The drafting of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and Oireachtas is advancing, led by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Comprehensive progress on legacy issues from the Troubles is crucial in order to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors and to contribute to broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process.  The Government will continue to engage in support of that, consistent with our role and responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

We believe that all states should support the work of the ICC.</p>  <p>  Since January 2015, following Palestine's accession to the Rome Statute on 2 January 2015 and its declaration of 1 January 2015, lodged under article 12(3) of the Statute accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC over alleged crimes committed "in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014&rdquo;, the situation in Palestine has been subject to a preliminary examination conducted by the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC in order to ascertain whether the criteria set out in the Statute for opening an investigation have been met.  In May 2018, the Prosecutor received a referral from Palestine which &ldquo;requests the Prosecutor to investigate, in accordance with the temporal jurisdiction of the Court, past, ongoing and future crimes within the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction, committed in all parts of the territory of the State of Palestine&rdquo;.  The question of proceeding with an investigation is therefore under consideration by the Office of the Prosecutor.</p></reply>

In that case, Ireland will have an exclusive taxing right.</p>  <p>  Article 18(2) reads: "(a) Any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority, in the discharge of functions of a governmental nature, shall be taxable only in that State.  (b)However, such pension shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that State."</p>  <p>  Remuneration and pensions paid out of public funds for work carried out in educational institutions have the consideration of a Government service in application of Article 18(3) of the Convention as amended by the Protocol of 1998, which reads: "Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall respectively apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration of an individual employed in an educational institution and to any pension in respect of such employment of an individual formerly so employed, paid directly by, or wholly or mainly from funds provided by, a Contracting State&hellip;  "</p>  <p>  If the pension is received by an individual who worked as a teacher, but the salary did not arise from public funds, then Article 17 (Pensions) of the Convention determines that the taxing right corresponds exclusively to the State of residence, in this case, Ireland.</p>  <p>  Article 17 reads: "Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 18, pensions and other similar remuneration paid in consideration of past employment to a resident of a Contracting State and any annuity paid to such a resident shall be taxable only in that State."</p>  <p>  Any possible double taxation that may occur would be relieved with the application of Article 21(2) of the Convention, which reads: "Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof)&mdash; (a) Irish tax payable under the laws of Ireland and in accordance with this Convention... shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Irish tax is computed."</p>  <p>  The form of operation of the provision above is a matter for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p>  <p>  Given the complexities set out above, it would be best for the individual concerned to make contact with Revenue directly to get the full clarity sought.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible. Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. </p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>The NCSE works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at <i>. </i></p><p>My officials have informed me that the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy took an appeal against the decision of a school to expel their son. The appeal which took place on 22/2/2018 was not upheld. Home Tuition was sanctioned as an interim measure from 19/2/2018 to 23/3/2018 and again from 23/4/2018 to 1/6/2018.</p><p>In circumstances, where there is no school placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department will provide the Home Tuition grant towards the provision of 20 hours tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available.</p><p>My officials have informed me that the Home Tuition Grant was approved for the child referred to by the Deputy on 7 September 2018, as an interim measure until a school placement becomes available.  </p><p>The NCSE has advised that the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) is continuing to liaise with the parents of the child and has identified a suitable school placement in which they may enrol their child.</p></reply>

Similarly, the deployment of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  With regard to the incident referred to by the Deputy, I am advised by the Garda authorities that a removal was conducted on behalf of the property&rsquo;s owner, and was the subject of a High Court order directing people who had been occupying the premises to vacate it. The removal of individuals from the property was not conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but by a private firm acting for the owner of the premises on foot of this High Court Order. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that the role of the Garda&iacute; who were in attendance at the scene that evening was to facilitate the High Court order being carried out safely, to ensure public order and to facilitate peaceful protest. I understand that Community Garda&iacute; were deployed initially and were later supported by a Garda Public Order Unit.</p>  <p>  The execution of High Court orders is not a matter which falls within the remit of the Private Security Authority. The law and procedures governing the execution of Court Orders are contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts and the Rules of Court made under them, and any dispute in relation to the enforcement of a Court Order is solely a matter for the Courts. </p>  <p>  I note Commissioner Harris&rsquo;s recent statement in relation to the protest and he has requested a report from the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), to see what lessons can be learned from the event. I understand that this review will include an examination of a particular vehicle involved in the removal of the persons from the premises, as well as any other associated Road Traffic Act offences that might have occurred. I also note that the Policing Authority will be pursuing this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too. </p>  <p>  The right to protest is a fundamental one in any democracy, and one which must be protected and facilitated.  However, it is also a right that must be exercised peacefully and with respect for the rights of others. In this context, we must not lose sight of the fact that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were enforcing the law of the land in what were very difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has pointed out, there has been some disquiet about members of the Public Order Unit wearing hoods.  The Commissioner has said they should have been worn in conjunction with helmets and you will be familiar with public order police around the world wearing helmets in the course of their policing duties.</p>  <p>  It is a sad fact and a worrying development that Garda&iacute;, and particularly those who undertake public order policing, are frequently personally targeted and subjected to vile abuse and threats, particularly online.  At the protest itself, the Garda&iacute; were subject to sustained abuse, including in one incident, racist abuse and I condemn that behaviour. Where behaviour crosses the line into criminality, it may be investigated but it would be preferable if the crime did not occur at all. I would appeal to people to recognise that Garda&iacute; simply doing their jobs should not be targeted in this way.</p></reply>

It is regrettable that there has been a substantial reduction in the strength of the Reserve in recent years from a peak of 1,164 in 2013. The fall-off arises from a range of factors, not least the lifting in 2014 of the moratorium on recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute; which has affected Reserve numbers in two ways: firstly, since 2014, 276 serving Reserves have successfully applied to become trainee Garda&iacute;, and secondly, both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) have been focused on delivering an accelerated programme of recruitment of full time members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree, notwithstanding the very valuable contribution of Reserve members throughout the country, that it was the right decision, with finite resources, to prioritise running recruitment campaigns to replenish the full-time ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the last three years. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing , while recognising the value of a Garda Reserve, has recommended that recruitment to the Garda Reserve should be paused, pending the outcome of the Strategic Review. I have indicated my intention to seek Government&rsquo;s approval for a High Level Implementation Plan following further detailed consideration of the Report and discussions with the Garda Commissioner, relevant Government Departments and Agencies. Future plans for the Garda Reserve will be taken forward in that context.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link.</p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link:</p></reply>

The removal of individuals from the property was conducted by a private firm acting for the owner of the premises on foot of this High Court Order. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that the role of the Garda&iacute; who were in attendance at the scene that evening was to facilitate the High Court&rsquo;s order being carried out safely, to ensure public order and to facilitate peaceful protest. The Deputy will appreciate that the manner in which any Garda operation is conducted is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no role in this regard. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the execution of such orders is not a matter which falls within the remit of the Private Security Authority. The law and procedures governing the execution of Court Orders are contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts and the Rules of Court made under them, and any dispute in relation to the enforcement of a Court Order is solely a matter for the Courts. Accordingly, the persons involved in the execution of the High Court order are not licensable by the Private Security Authority.</p>  <p>  I note Commissioner Harris&rsquo;s recent statement in relation to the protest and he has requested a report from the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), to see what lessons can be learned from the event. I understand that this review will include an examination of a particular vehicle involved in the removal of the persons from the premises, as well as any other associated Road Traffic Act offences that might have occurred. I also note that the Policing Authority will be pursuing this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too. </p>  <p>  The right to protest is a fundamental one in any democracy and one which must be protected and facilitated.  However, it is also a right that must be exercised peacefully and with respect for the rights of others. In this context, we must not lose sight of the fact that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were enforcing the law of the land in what were very difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  It is a sad fact and a worrying development that Garda&iacute;, and particularly those who undertake public order policing, are frequently personally targeted and subjected to vile abuse and threats, particularly online.  At the protest itself, the Garda&iacute; were subject to sustained abuse, including in one incident, racist abuse and I condemn that behaviour. Where behaviour crosses the line into criminality, it may be investigated, but it would be preferable if the crime did not occur at all. I would appeal to people to recognise that Garda&iacute; simply doing their jobs should not be targeted in this way.</p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

Officials' access to the report was for the purposes of seeking the advice of the Attorney General, and of preparing a Memorandum for Government. Those receiving the report were advised in writing as to its confidentiality and that they were not permitted to copy the report. </p>  <p>  At this point, in accordance with Dr Scally's report, there are two priority tasks.

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. The Minister for Health does not have any statutory power or function in relation to reimbursement of medicines</p>  <p>  Under the 2013 Act, if a company wishes to have a medicine reimbursed through the community drugs schemes, it must first submit an application to the HSE to have the medicine added to the Reimbursement List. The HSE deals directly with the applicant during this statutory process and not representative bodies, such as the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention. </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.

Under Statutory Instrument No. 8 of 2017, which transposes the Directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health is the competent authority for the assessment of psychology qualifications and I am advised on applications by the Psychological Society of Ireland. The process is administered by the Validation Unit on my behalf.  </p>  <p>  Directive 2005/36/EC provides a mechanism under which non-Irish professional qualifications can be considered for recognition but it is considered to be a very complicated piece of legislation.

For this reason, applicants are advised not to apply for positions until their qualifications have been recognised.</p>  <p>  As the applicant was advised in the Validation Unit's letter of 26 June 2018, decisions on applications must be made within four months of acknowledgement of a complete application; accordingly, the applicant will receive a decision on this application before 26 October 2018.  </p>  <p>  While I appreciate that the applicant is anxious to receive a decision on her application, I trust, however, that the applicant will understand that, in the interest of fairness, applications are dealt with in the order in which they are received. </p></reply>

The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focused on electric vehicles, is currently nearing completion. The second phase, which will commence this month, will look at other alternative fuels including compressed natural gas. This will include the examination of what supports are needed to incentivise investment in compressed natural gas refuelling infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In July I launched the first Call for Applications for the Climate Action Fund. This is one of the four funds established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project Ireland 2040. It will provide at least &euro;500 million to support initiatives that contribute to the achievement of Ireland's climate and energy targets over the next decade. Alternative fuels infrastructure projects, such as compressed natural gas refuelling infrastructure, are eligible to apply.  Further information can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In addition, Gas Networks Ireland are currently developing 14 publicly accessible compressed natural gas refilling stations. The first of these, at Dublin Port, is due to open later this year. </p>  <p>  Although there are currently no specific supports for the installation of compressed natural gas refuelling infrastructure, there is a commitment set out in the National Policy Framework for Alternative Fuels Infrastructure in Ireland 2017-2030 to introduce a new accelerated capital allowance tax incentive for companies.</p>  <p>  The aim of this incentive is to encourage investment in refuelling infrastructure and equipment for compressed natural gas. Such an incentive would allow companies to write off 100% of the purchase value of qualifying vehicles and refuelling equipment, including compressed natural gas compression refuelling infrastructure, against their profit in the year of purchase. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, taxation matters ultimately fall under the remit of the Minister of Finance, who must assess the merit of proposed new incentives and consider the need to balance the investment of public resources and monies with the effective contribution towards achieving our decarbonisation objectives.</p></reply>

As a consequence, no passenger licences have been issued which include Inishmurray on their plying limits. It was recommended that no such licences be issued until such time as the appropriate landing facility has been provided. No passenger boat licences have been revoked due to this issue and those passenger boats which have the appropriate licences may approach the island so that passengers may see the island and take photographs. </p>  <p>  It was brought to the attention of the MSO that certain boats were advertising trips to the island and as such may have been operating outside the terms of their passenger boat licences. As safety regulator, the MSO has a responsibility to ensure the safety of passengers and officials of the MSO contacted the owners of these vessels to remind them of their obligations.</p>  <p>  Further to my response to Parliamentary No 464 on 3 July 2018, I wish to make clear that this issue relates to the issuing of passenger boat licences. A passenger boat is defined in the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 and includes a boat carrying up to 12 passengers for reward or while carrying up to 12 persons to or from their place of work. It would not include persons using a boat by themselves or while carrying friends or family as non-fare paying passengers. Such vessels may be considered to be recreational craft which do not require passenger boat licences but may still be subject to other regulation. My Department recently updated its code of practice on the safe operation of recreational craft.</p>  <p>  The solution is the provision of an appropriately safe landing facility. This is a matter for the owner of the property on which the facility would be built and the appropriate local authority, which in this instance is Sligo County Council. Once an appropriate landing facility is provided, officials of the MSO can assess it and any passenger vessel proposing to use it with a view to granting the appropriate licence.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through the setting of mandatory speed limits.  One of the expected benefits of these new measures shall be a reduction in the impact of congestion and the level of disruption resulting from incidents on the M50 while enhancing journey time reliability.    </p>  <p>  In conjunction with TII, officials in my Department are currently working on arrangements to put this project in place.</p></reply>

Arising from the arrangements in place in relation to Local Property Tax receipts, the four Dublin Councils are largely self-funding for works on regional and local roads since 2015 and my Department no longer provides grants to these Councils under the main regional and localroad grant categories.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority's (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades. Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy. The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  The recently announced proposals for bridge enhancement and traffic diversion in Celbridge is also an NTA project, and driven by them.</p>  <p>  In light of this I have also forwarded the Deputy's requests for information to the NTA for direct reply.</p></reply>

Following consideration of the expressions of interest, and the two valid proposals for new pools, it was decided to include the proposal from South Dublin County Council (SDCC) for a new swimming pool in Lucan in the LASPP.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, there are now four swimming pool projects in the current LASPP and the priority in 2018 is on progressing these projects.</p>  <p>  In relation to the future funding of swimming pools, the National Development Plan (NDP) confirms the establishment of a new Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). An initial amount of &euro;100m has been provided in the plan for the period from 2019 to 2027.  It is intended that the Fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount currently available for individual projects under the Sports Capital Programme. The fund will initially focus on the National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities. While the detailed terms and conditions of the new scheme are currently being finalised in my Department, it is envisaged that applications for new swimming pool projects will be accepted. An announcement in relation to when applications will be accepted will be made shortly. </p></reply>

Representatives from both agencies and the reviewer have met regularly since June. The work to date has focused on agreeing the sampling methodology, in consultation with a statistician, addressing the data protection issues, identifying the specific records to be reviewed, and agreeing a template to be applied by social workers reviewing the records.</p>  <p>  There are an estimated 150,000 adoption records in existence and, of these, approximately 100,000 are currently in the custody of the State - either Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland. The review is focused on those records and a targeted sampling exercise is being carried out in the first instance, owing to the volume of records involved. This targeted review will help to establish the extent of usable information that can be found in these historical records. The review will provide information to assist me in identifying more fully the scale of illegal birth registrations and in identifying any necessary next steps.</p>  <p>  Tusla and the Adoption Authority are working hard to extract and examine the records. This is a very complex task, and issues have arisen in relation to data protection and GDPR (the General Data Protection Regulations). These issues mean that the estimated timeline for the Independent Review's Report is now mid-December.</p></reply>

The LDA will act as a new commercial State body to actively manage development land with two primary objectives.  </p>  <p>  - The first objective is to ensure the optimal usage of State lands, coordinating their regeneration and development and opening up key sites not being optimally used, especially for delivery of new homes.</p>  <p>  - The second objective is to drive strategic land assembly through mechanisms that will bring together both public and private sector interests in ensuring the timely preparation and release of strategic land for development in a counter-cyclical manner. Such counter-cyclical action will be aimed at stabilising any tendency towards volatility in development land values, securing more of the increase in such values as a result of the planning and infrastructure investment processes for the common good and thereby driving increased affordability through better and more cost-competitive land availability.</p>  <p>  The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.</p>  <p>  The LDA has been established, with three staff members initially rising to five in the weeks ahead and rising progressively thereafter, in line with the expansion of its development lands portfolio.  The expectation is that the Agency will have some 25 staff when fully operational. Staffing of the LDA will be focused on securing experienced personnel in the areas of planning, construction and development, project management, finance, procurement and law. </p>  <p>  Now that it has been established, the LDA is in the process of advancing agreements with various State bodies in relation to a range of sites, with the Housing Agency, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Defence participating in the first tranche of land agreements. A detailed business plan for the LDA is currently in development and will provide additional information on its delivery programme.</p>  <p>  Moreover, to support the work of the LDA, the Government has agreed new policies requiring that 30% of public lands coming forward for redevelopment and or disposal are to be reserved for affordable housing purposes, in addition to the statutory requirement for 10% social housing under Part V provisions, ensuring more housing supply at affordable prices and rents.</p>  <p>  My Department is advancing the preparation of primary legislation to underpin the LDA in the longer term, replacing the Order under which it has currently been established.  It is expected that a General Scheme will be published later this Autumn with a Bill being published in early 2019, ensuring that the LDA has a clear mandate and sufficient powers, including in relation to compulsory acquisition if that becomes necessary, to deliver.</p></reply>

The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders. The draft standard was published on 6 June 2018 for public consultation and ran for a period of six weeks to 18 July 2018. The Technical Committee are currently in the process of considering the submissions received with a view to publishing the standardised protocol shortly.</p><p>The draft standard, I.S. 465 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials, outlines a protocol which will be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite. Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks to help decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.</p><p>This standard:</p><p>1. establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite);</p><p>2. describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem;</p><p>3. describes the scope of any testing required; and</p><p>4. categorises buildings, in accordance with this Standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference.  Engineers Ireland has provided assurance that they will collaborate with the Department, the NSAI and others on measures to establish such a register once the standardised protocol is in place.</p><p>Last year, I visited Donegal and Mayo and met with key stakeholders, including affected homeowners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties. On 18 December 2017, I again visited Donegal and met with key stakeholders to provide an update on the progress to date.  I made a similar visit to Mayo on 26 January 2018 and again to Donegal on 13 July 2018. </p><p>I will be in a position to provide a further update following the publication of the standardized protocol in the coming weeks.</p></reply>
