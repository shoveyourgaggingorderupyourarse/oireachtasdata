    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-04a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019120400066#WRC01900"><p>The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection role in relation to wage setting is restricted to the setting of the National Minimum Wage on the basis of recommendations from the Low Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  Legislation in relation to the setting of the National Minimum Wage has existed since 2000.  The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to providing for adjustments which do not impact negatively on jobs or competitiveness.  The Commission thus takes an evidence-based approach to its recommendations, having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  </p>  <p>  The most recent figures published by Eurostat in January 2019 show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,656.2 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;2,071 per month (for comparison purposes Eurostat converts countries&rsquo; hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates).  Allowing for purchasing power standards, Ireland drops to sixth place, but still remains in the group with the highest minimum wage rates in the EU.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the problems recently faced in the Meat Industry the Government continues to assist low income earners with a number of in-work and other supports.  The Government continues its ongoing communication with all stakeholders of the sector to reach best possible outcomes.</p>  <p>  The average earnings per week for the manufacturing sector as published by the CSO for Quarter 1 in 2019 increased by 3.5% from Quarter 4 in 2018, however manufacturing, among other factors, is subject to external competition and exchange rate fluctuations.</p>  <p>  In terms of wage-setting generally, however, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through its responsibilities for industrial relations matters, has a role with regard to relations between businesses and employers and their employees, and in relation to wage-setting more particularly through mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements, Joint Labour Committees and Sectoral Employment Orders, which remain firmly in the industrial relations and wage bargaining spheres.</p></reply>

This is a service which my Department provides so that the media - both domestic and international - can easily and freely avail of photography where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated.  In 2019 these included events such as the visit in April of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi; the State Visit to Ireland in May by Their Majesties King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden;

I remain in regular and ongoing contact with Secretary of State Smith on how the two Governments can support the parties in reaching an agreement that will get all of the institutions of the Agreement up and running again.</p>  <p>  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I have confirmed that the two Governments are ready to take talks in Northern Ireland forward again immediately following the UK general election.</p>  <p>  The recent indications from each of the party leaders in Northern Ireland that they are also ready to engage again with urgency is welcome and important.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that talks will commence as soon as possible after the UK election, potentially on 16 December. This of course depends to some extent on the outcome of the election.</p>  <p>  All five political parties have engaged constructively in the talks process over the last number of months. Progress has been made across a range of important issues. However, some key outstanding issues remain and finding final agreement on these issues will require genuine and courageous dialogue and leadership by the party leaders in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  People want the devolved power-sharing institutions up and running again to represent their interests and address issues of concern in Northern Ireland at present.</p>  <p>  In this context, the political parties - in particular the two largest parties - must live up to their responsibilities and be open to fair and workable compromises on the small number of outstanding issues, to secure the overall interests of people in Northern Ireland and to protect and operate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement again.</p>  <p>  The current UK legislation under which civil servants in NI are working in the absence of Ministers expires on 13 January next and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has confirmed that a duty to call an Assembly election arises if that deadline is passed. </p>  <p>  The Governments are determined to use the time immediately ahead to work to get real power-sharing back in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland. Ultimately the challenge is for the parties to find an agreement. This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals, nor am I in a position to direct them to provide cover to such individuals. </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer mortgage protection cover and what terms to apply.  These factors can include age, health, family medical history, occupation and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the length of time such a policy may last.  In the case of mortgage protection policy, such policies tend to be over a much longer term, for example, 25 years or over the lifetime of the mortgage repayment schedule.  Furthermore, my understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and that they will price in accordance with their own past claims experience. </p>  <p>  While I have sympathy for the situation detailed, I am unable to comment on specific cases.  However, it should be noted that my officials contacted Insurance Ireland in regard to a similar case in the past. Insurance Ireland advised that applicants for any type of life assurance will be asked on the application form detailed health questions and that insurers may request one or more of the following in addition: a report from the applicant&rsquo;s GP; an independent medical examination; or other medical tests.  On the basis of the information provided, the application is considered individually and the decision on whether to offer cover and on what terms depends on the facts of that particular case. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.</p></reply>

Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the FRE review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category of FRE allowance is being examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, which provides that expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that its FRE review is ongoing but is now nearing conclusion.</p>  <p>  As I informed the House recently during the Report Stage debate on the Finance Bill, while I am aware of the effect that changes to the FRE regime will have on those who are impacted by the changes, I also need to respect the independence of Revenue. </p>  <p>  Having regard to the fact that we are coming closer to the date on which any changes on foot of the review are due to be implemented, I have, as I committed previously to do, written to Revenue seeking a factual update on the review.  Once this process of engagement with Revenue has been completed, I will be able to comment further on the matter and, conscious of the timeline involved, I anticipate that I will be able to do so very shortly.</p></reply>

It is not proposed that this position will change.  </p>  <p>  The Flat Rate Expenses regime exists as a support to that right and it provides an efficient and transparent mechanism for significant numbers of employees, who incur a similar expense in the course of their employment duties, to obtain tax relief (in respect of the expense) without having to submit annual claims to Revenue. It also provides efficiencies for Revenue by reducing the administrative cost of processing large volumes of identical claims for similar groups of employees.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the review of the FRE regime, which is in line with best practice and good corporate governance, is to ensure the expenses agreed are still justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices and are in accordance with the legislative requirement for deduction as set out in section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA).</p></reply>

These reforms aim to increase transparency around the budgetary process and facilitate stronger dialogue on key elements of the Budget and on what is being achieved with public funds. </p>  <p>  Central to this is a &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework. Rather than focusing budget discussions only around Budget Day, this refers to an ongoing consideration of budgetary priorities and the publication of a range of documents to enhance engagement throughout the year. Some of these documents include:</p>  <p>- Stability Programme Update   &ndash; the Stability Programme Update (SPU), published in April each year, is Ireland&rsquo;s national medium-term fiscal plan and includes an update of the economic and fiscal outlook.</p>  <p>- Summer Economic Statement   &ndash; the Summer Economic Statement builds on the SPU and sets out the fiscal parameters and budgetary strategy for the upcoming Budget.</p>  <p>- Mid-Year Expenditure Report   &ndash; the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, published in July each year, sets out the Departmental expenditure baseline for the medium-term, based on the strategy outlined in the SES.    </p>  <p>- Tax Strategy Group Papers   &ndash; Each year, papers exploring tax policy options are prepared by the Tax Strategy Group. In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to budgetary reform, the Tax Strategy Group papers are now published in advance of the Budget to facilitate informed discussion. </p>  <p>  Further to this, in recent year there has been a greater emphasis placed on enhancing the evaluation capacity of Government departments. In light of this, a number of additional reports and processes now support the budgetary framework including:</p>  <p>- Public Service Performance Report   - In April/early May each year, the Public Service Performance Report is published. This report presents performance information in a timely fashion, and aims to facilitate informed discussion around what is being delivered with public funds. A key objective of the Performance Budgeting Initiative is to shift focus away from the quantum of spend and towards what is being achieved through that spending. The intention of the Performance Report is to help enhance the focus on performance and delivery by presenting relevant performance  indicators in a dedicated, focused document. </p>  <p>- Equality budgeting   &ndash; The Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2018 saw the roll-out of a pilot programme of equality budgeting. For the pilot exercise, a number of diverse policy areas were selected with associated objectives and indicators. The learnings from the pilot are being used to inform the expansion of the equality budgeting initiative to further develop the gender budgeting  elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. An Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group has also been established. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance Equality Budgeting policy and progress the initiative. Most recently, an OECD "Policy Scan" Report on Equality Budgeting has been completed, and was published on Budget Day in October last, and it sets out a number of ambitious objectives about advancing this aspect of the budgetary reform agenda.      </p>  <p>- Capital Tracker   - The tracker lists a range  of projects and programmes to be delivered by Departments to 2027. Published in an Excel format, for each project, the tracker indicates the stage it is at in the project life-cycle, e.g. Stage 1 pre-appraisal,  Stage 5 Implementation. </p>  <p>- Spending Review   - The process aims to improve how public expenditure is allocated across all areas of  Government. Announced in Budget 2017, it aims to place evidence at the heart of policy making, by systematically examining existing spending programmes with a view to assessing their efficiency and effectiveness,  and to support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities. </p>  <p>Finally, building upon the commitment to budget transparency, and to further enhance the accessibility and availability of budget information tailored towards the general public, at budget time this year, a dedicated citizen&rsquo;s guide   to the budget was published in clear non-technical language. The guide is an objective, self-contained document, in a concise and accessible format. The guide seeks to foster greater understanding of the Budget process and the public finances more generally.</p></reply>

A formal Exhibition was held in May 2019 where the public were able to review the scheme design and measures and provide feedback on what is being proposed. The scheme proposals were generally well received and the lead consultants are currently reviewing the feedback received, finalising the design and all the documentation required for submission of the scheme for formal Confirmation of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. All submissions received during the public exhibition will be responded to.</p>  <p>  It is planned for the scheme to be submitted for Confirmation in early 2020.  Subject to Confirmation it is hoped to commence construction in the second half of 2020 after tendering for works contractors, with an estimated construction period of 3 years. </p>  <p>  The proposed scheme will be funded by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and I can confirm that provision for the cost of the scheme is included in the OPW's multi-annual capital framework and the allocation for flood relief in the National Development Plan 2018-2027.</p></reply>

This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings, to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, we will invest &euro;8.4 billion in primary and post primary school buildings.  The government is committed to a PE Hall build and modernisation programme, starting in the second half of the Project Ireland 2040 period. </p>  <p>  The provision of general purpose rooms and PE Halls form part of the accommodation brief for all newly established schools. These facilities may also form part of the overall accommodation brief for major capital extensions to existing schools.</p>  <p>  These measures will ensure that students in all post-primary schools can have access to state of the art facilities to support PE provision, particularly also in the context of the roll-out of PE as a Leaving Certificate subject.</p>  <p>  A new specification for examinable Leaving Certificate Physical Education (LCPE) subject and a new non-examinable Framework for Senior Cycle Physical Education (SCPE) were introduced on a phased basis from September 2018. </p>  <p>  The examinable LCPE specification is currently being delivered in 64 schools and will be examined for the first time in 2020. The national rollout of Leaving Certificate Physical Education will commence from September 2020. </p>  <p>  40 schools are participating in Phase 1 rollout of the Framework during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 school years. The Framework is available now to all schools for their consideration in planning for Senior Cycle Physical Education. From September 2020, the new Framework will replace the existing guidelines set out in the Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools, which currently form the basis for Physical Education at Senior Cycle.</p>  <p>  The Framework is designed to support teachers in planning quality learning in Physical Education for all students in Senior Cycle and will not be assessed as part of the Leaving Certificate examination. It will assist schools to design a physical education programme for senior cycle students, including students who do or do not elect to take Physical Education as a subject for their Leaving Certificate examination. The Framework is structured around six curriculum models and is designed to be taught over two or three years of Senior Cycle.  </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive on the Healthy Ireland agenda. My Department is represented on a number of groups including the National Physical Activity Plan Implementation Group and on the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group.  </p>  <p>  Healthy Lifestyles guidance issued to post primary schools in 2015 and primary schools in 2016. This guidance was drafted in consultation with the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  My Department acknowledges the commitment of schools in promoting healthy lifestyle choices for students in a number of ways - the curriculum &ndash; for example Physical Education and Social Personal Health Education (SPHE); through schools policy including healthy lunch policies and by the use of resources and programmes chosen by the school. The Active School Flag (ASF) is one such programme. Work by my Department in this area aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge to enable them to make the right choices for healthy lifestyles throughout their lives.  </p>  <p>  The primary curriculum is currently undergoing a process of review and redevelopment, which includes SPHE and the time allocated. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will publish a draft overview of a redeveloped primary curriculum in early 2020. This draft will be the basis for an extensive consultation which will feed into the overall shape and direction of a redeveloped curriculum.</p>  <p>  At post primary, SPHE is compulsory at Junior Cycle and Physical Health is an element of SPHE.  In year one, the module focuses on life-style patterns that support good physical health.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-04a.195.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019120400069#WRF03400"><p>I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools.  I have spoken to a number of staff about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p><p>In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries; schools with enrolments of 626-699 to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled, and schools of 700 or more to fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020.</p><p>Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.</p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.</p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.My Department receives informal correspondence by telephone in respect of grant-funded secretary and caretaker circulars, as regularly occurs with the publication of pay circulars.  Advice is provided on the implementation of the circular and the appropriate steps to take.  Secretaries and Caretakers who have queries regarding the application of the circular should raise queries directly with their individual employer / Board of Management.</p><p>In addition, the recent survey of Secretaries and Caretakers has identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department will be making contact with these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim. </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.</p><p>On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.</p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account. However, school authorities should, where possible, use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. The staffing schedule is available on my Department's website at</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, DEIS Plan acknowledges the allocation of teaching resources to DEIS primary schools with the highest concentrations of children at risk of educational disadvantage has served to improve learning outcomes.  It also commits to the evaluation of the level of teaching resources for schools participating in DEIS to be undertaken to inform future policy in this area.</p><p>In order to facilitate this a Class Size Working Group was established comprising representatives from the Education Partners, the Educational Research Centre and the relevant Business Units in my Department. This group has met on a number of occasions to consider class size in the context of  improved learning outcomes of those most at risk of educational disadvantage. </p><p>A report on the work of this group is currently being finalised, and will take into consideration the feedback and observations of the working group members.  It is intended that this will be finalised in the coming weeks and its findings will inform future policy direction in this area.</p></reply>

However it is important to be aware that any amendment to existing terms in the numerous Acts and Statutory Instruments involved will need to be very carefully considered, to ensure there are no unintended legal consequences for prosecutions in these important cases.  </p><p>There is no particular timeline in that regard, as the Deputy will appreciate all legislation is kept under review.</p></reply>

In addition to the general support that it provides to client firms on the investment climate in Ireland, the Agency is authorised by my Department to provide a range of particular financial supports in the form of employment, capital, research and development, environmental and training grants. While these grants are not Brexit-specific, they do represent an important means of encouraging companies to invest in regional Ireland. Last year alone, the IDA provided a total of &euro;4.3m in grant funding to client companies in the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan. </p>  <p>  More broadly, my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports to ensure that businesses nationwide are as prepared as possible for Brexit. </p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland, for example, offers a Brexit Planning Voucher that enables businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for Brexit. Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. ITI has also launched a further financial support in the form of the Brexit Implementation Voucher, which offers financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with ITI paying 50% towards implementing critical changes in relation to Brexit matters.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), meanwhile, are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business, including businesses in the border counties. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. Up to November, just under 1200 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. Last month, it was announced that over &euro;1 million of R&amp;D funding has been awarded through Co-Innovate. </p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched by my Department in March 2018. It provides relatively short-term working capital, up to three years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties. Dublin aside, the most recent quarterly report shows that the border region is the most active region in terms of eligibility applications for the scheme. Mid-November figures showed that there have been 892 eligibility applications received, of which 804 have been approved and 212 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;46.6 million. It should be noted that 159 of total applications received relate to repeat/duplicate applications, as eligibility expires after six months. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for eligibility applications in April 2019. This scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8-10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment at competitive rates. This scheme has been jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make available loans of &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for primary agriculture) to &euro;3 million, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis.  The scheme is open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has also established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.

The current level of demand is due to our economic success, growing labour market and reduced labour surplus.  </p>  <p>  Employment Permits Section is working to further reduce the current waiting times of approximately:</p>  <p>  - 3 weeks for Trusted Partners, which account for 76% of permits issued this year (down from a peak of 7 weeks).  Trusted Partners are regular users of the service.</p>  <p>  - 10 weeks for standard applications, which account for 24% of permits issued this year (down from a peak of 16 weeks).</p>  <p>  In order to further reduce processing times, the Employment Permits section has introduced a number of operational changes, streamlined processes and implemented ICT solutions.  Additional staffing resources have also been assigned to the section and a fast track training programme has been devised.   </p>  <p>  These processing timelines are good by international standards but they are not where we want them to be. I can assure the Deputy that all available resources are being deployed with the aim of reducing them. Whilst there is still room for improvement in relation to reducing processing times for standard applications, it should be noted that, overall, 76% of all employment permit applications are currently being processed in approximately 3 weeks.   </p>  <p>  The number of applications being received by my Department is currently at an 11-year high.  At end November 2019, 17,216 applications have been received, an 11% increase on the same time last year.  At the same time there has been a 24% increase in the amount of applications processed (17,535) compared to the same period last year.  In July 2019, Employment Permits Section processed more employment permit applications (1,828) than during any month in the past 11 years.  Quarter 3 of 2019 was the busiest Quarter in the last 11 years with 5,072 permit applications being processed so the changes currently being implemented within Employment Permits are resulting in higher outputs and reduced processing times.  </p>  <p>  An independent Business Process Review (BPR) is currently being carried out to identify further efficiencies that can be implemented in the short term and as a first step in the development of a new IT processing system during 2020 which will take advantage of all the new technologies available, including full digitisation.  The Review, which included engagement from key stakeholders, is close to completion with the report expected before the end of the year.  It is anticipated that the implementation of the recommendations of the Review, including the implementation of a new IT processing system, will result in further streamlined processes and reduced processing times.</p>  <p>  My officials have been proactively engaging with customers to notify them of current processing timelines through email, meetings and regular updates on the Employment Permits section of my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Applicants are advised to apply for the employment permit at least 12 weeks in advance of the expected start date so that any impact of the current extended processing timelines on recruitment timeframes is minimised.</p></reply>

The Taskforce has been established for a two year period and is meeting regularly, there have been two full meetings to date with the third scheduled for December. </p>  <p>  Membership of the Taskforce includes staff from multiple units within the Department of Health as well as representatives from the Department of Justice and Equality, the HSE, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the European Institute of Women's Health, the Institute of Public Health, and the Irish College of General Practitioners.     </p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy that while it is not possible to have a representative from every area of women's health participate directly on the Taskforce, listening to the experiences of women is central to its work.</p>  <p>  Each week, external experts in the area of women's health meet with members of the Taskforce in the Department of Health to inform its work. This initiative has been underway since the Taskforce was established.  The Endometriosis Association of Ireland recently presented to members of the Taskforce, highlighting this important issue which affects many women in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the first action of the Taskforce is to lead a 'radical listening' exercise inviting women in Ireland to share their  experiences of and solutions for the health system.  There will be multiple opportunities for anyone interested to feed into the work of the Taskforce and I would encourage them to do so.  The work of the Taskforce, as well as opportunities to engage, can be tracked on the Taskforce's webpage. </p>  <p>  This information and data, combined with the other available evidence will form the basis for future policy and action to improve women's health in Ireland.  </p></reply>

Therefore, the details requested will only be known following engagements by these financial institutions with the Commission and the EIB.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, through my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in partnership with the Department of Finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has already engaged with the EIB &amp;amp; the European Investment Fund (EIF) to develop the Future Growth Loan Scheme.  It is being delivered through participating finance providers nationally and will make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agrifood &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p>  <p>   The loans are competitively priced (an initial maximum loan interest rate of 4.5% for loans less than &euro;250,000), will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. A minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 applies up to a maximum of &euro;3,000,000 per applicant. However, considering the needs of Irish farmers, I have negotiated a specific minimum of &euro;50,000 for them.</p>  <p>   This is a financial product that was previously unavailable in Ireland, hence the involvement of the various public bodies to bring it to market. The unique characteristic of the Scheme is that loans up to &euro;500,000 are unsecured making it a viable source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p>  <p>  Food companies have identified long-term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland.  I am happy that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain from primary producer to processor.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has been open for loan eligibility applications through the SBCI website since 17th April and there has been a good level of demand from farmers. In total 2,017 loans are approved, of which 725 are farmers, and 236 are food companies. A total of 686 loans to the value of &euro;147.4m have been sanctioned. Of these, 320 loans are to farmers with a total sanction amount of &euro;38.2m and 64 are food companies with a total sanction amount of &euro;22m.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-04a.421.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019120400072#WRJ04300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190, 191, 193 and 195 together.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland. It is vital that we ensure that people of rural Ireland have the same opportunities as people in our towns and cities. </p>  <p>  The fundamental building blocks of the project, which is designed to bring fibre to the home to over 1.1 million people in the intervention area, have not changed since the procurement process commenced. The project is led by Granahan McCourt, supported by key subcontractors enet and the Kelly Group, with Nokia as the provider of electronic equipment. </p>  <p>  After appointment as the preferred bidder, the sponsors were required to finalise a number of steps before a contract could be signed. The Department was also required to carry out the necessary due diligence. </p>  <p>  These steps included: </p>  <p>  - Closing out contracts with infrastructure access providers (eir and enet), civil engineering companies and equipment providers; </p>  <p>  - concluding the contractual provision in the 3,000 page contract and </p>  <p>  - finalisation of the committed equity documents with the shareholders of the new company, National Broadband Ireland. </p>  <p>  As is standard in large projects, including PPPs, the final mix of shareholders to the project is concluded where all contractual documents have been finalised. The NBP process has been no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  The bidder proposed for contract award that McCourt Global LLC be replaced by Oak Hill. The proposed bidder change was submitted to the Department on 11 November 2019. The entity referred to by the Deputy submitted documentation, as a bidder member, as part of the submission by the lead bidder (Granahan McCourt). The due diligence was carried out against the conditions set out in the assessment process and was approved. The procurement process for the National Broadband Plan contract includes a mechanism for the Department to assess and approve, or reject, changes to the membership of bidders. This assessment is carried out by ring fenced teams with similar make up to the teams that carried out the evaluation of the final tender, and overseen by a review panel and the Procurement Board. I have no role in the assessment.</p>  <p>  The Project Information Memorandum (PIM) dated December 2015 sets out the procurement process for the NBP. Relevant documents are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  As part of the assessment of a change, the relevant bidder is required to demonstrate that it continued to meet the economic and financial standing, together with technical and professional capacity, set out in the original pre-qualification criteria. The Department could not approve a change in bidder composition unless the relevant bidder met those criteria.</p>  <p>  The fact that any modifications to shareholding made after Final Tender would be reviewed by the Department in advance of Contract Award, was set out in information provided to the Oireachtas after the appointment of NBI as preferred Bidder and this information is included in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action and Environment in relation to the NBP. </p>  <p>  The funding commitments of National Broadband Ireland (NBI), including the equity investment commitments, have been contractualised as part of the contract award. </p>  <p>  The NBP contract with NBI is very detailed and comprehensive, setting out targets for delivery and implications for under performance. The Department as the contracting authority will manage all of the elements of contract governance. The Department has a core existing team of experts, which will be augmented by specialist external services to effectively manage the contract, including technical issues, financial advisory, business consultancy, economic diversity, quality assurance, environmental and legal services. </p>  <p>  A suitably redacted version of the contract will be made available on my Department&rsquo;s website in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

My Department has lead responsibility for the implementation of this action. A study is being commissioned to understand what measures are available and suitable to address the impacts of growing transport levels in our major cities (Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford). </p>  <p>  The study is to consider a range of factors in each of the cities, including congestion levels and air quality issues, and ultimately should recommend options on how we might better manage travel demand in each area. A tender process for this study is currently underway within my Department, with a view to awarding a contract before the end of 2019. I expect the findings of the study to be published by September 2020 in line with our Climate Action Plan commitment.</p>  <p>  Traffic congestion is a growing issue in Ireland&rsquo;s cities and some towns imposing economic and social costs on residents, commuters and businesses, as well as worsening emissions that impact on air quality and the environment.  In 2017, my Department estimated that congestion could have a cost of over &euro;2 billion per annum by 2033 in the absence of appropriate intervention.  Such a cost would have a substantial impact on our competitiveness along with a social cost to our citizens. </p>  <p>  It is, furthermore, estimated that, without intervention, by 2040 commuting trips nationally could rise by as much as 35% over current levels.  As well as associated economic costs, I am aware that road transport is a source of air pollution emissions, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). It is clear that we need to encourage a movement towards fewer and cleaner vehicles entering Irish cities. We are addressing some of these issues by:</p>  <p>  - Encouraging a shift out of cars to public transport and active travel;</p>  <p>  - Promoting zero-emission electric cars;</p>  <p>  - Transitioning the urban bus fleet towards lower emitting alternatives; and</p>  <p>  - Examining ways to green the freight sector.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, a significant investment of &euro;8.6 billion has been earmarked under the National Development Plan to increase the capacity and attractiveness of sustainable mobility.  This notwithstanding, transport is a derived demand and as both our population and economic performance are projected to grow, I expect that Ireland will see many more journeys on our transport networks. Over time, this rising travel demand coupled with a scarcity of space to expand road supply will exacerbate the issues that we see in our cities today and require that demand management measures be considered, including the potential role of urban congestion charging.  The findings of the study we are undertaking will ultimately support the implementation of any measures necessary.</p></reply>

New roads comprise the construction of new road sections along a greenfield route and/or a major upgrade along an existing route (e.g. the M7 widening and new interchanges). Planned investment in public transport projects over the same timeframe will be almost &euro;2.7bn, outstripping new roads spend considerably.</p>  <p>  In 2019 alone, the increased funding now available to support new sustainable mobility measures has supported Government&rsquo;s approval of a new National Train Control Centre and the expansion of the Greater Dublin Area commuter rail fleet, while the National Transport Authority is overseeing the continued expansion of our PSO bus fleets, the arrival of tram extensions for the Luas Green Line and increased investment in active travel projects across the major cities.</p></reply>

They provide vital goods and services in communities throughout the country and contribute to the delivery of many Government policy objectives in areas such as employment activation, affordable childcare, and the green economy. </p>  <p>  However, there is limited evidence and data about the scope, prevalence and contribution of social enterprises in Ireland.  A 2013 Forf&aacute;s report estimated that, in 2009, social enterprises employed between 25,000 and 33,000 people with an annual income of around &euro;1.4 billion.  However, the report also noted that it was difficult to differentiate social enterprises from the wider non-profit sector at that time.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there is no doubt that social enterprise is a growing part of the enterprise base in Ireland and has the potential to deliver social impact, support job creation and contribute to the national economy. </p>  <p>  I published Ireland's first National Social Enterprise Policy last July.  This Policy was developed on the basis of extensive consultation with stakeholders and background research.  </p>  <p>  The Policy includes 26 Measures to support the development of social enterprise over the four year period of the Policy, 2019-2022.  These Measures include a commitment to improve data collection on the extent of social enterprises in Ireland and the areas in which they operate.  The Policy also includes a commitment to develop mechanisms to measure the social and economic impact of social enterprises. </p>  <p>  My Department is already taking steps to deliver on these commitments.  In October, I announced a Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Research Fellowship on Social Enterprise delivered in collaboration with the Irish Research Council. The main purpose of the Fellowship is to develop a methodology to measure the impact of social enterprise in Ireland in the context of the new Policy and international best practice.  This research will enable a greater understanding of social enterprise in all of its forms in an Irish context.</p></reply>

The residual income of those on age related reduced rates after paying the minimum contribution payments on rent supplement, housing assistance payment (HAP) and other local authority housing supports is significantly lower than those on the maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or supplementary welfare allowance which can lead to financial hardship.</p>  <p>  This measure, which comes into effect in January 2020, will provide that young people in these circumstances can receive the maximum rate of payment and will help young people to continue living independently and reduce the threat of financial hardship.  For those aged 18-24 this will provide a weekly increase of up to &euro;90.30 with their weekly payment increasing from &euro;112.70 to &euro;203 for jobseekers and to &euro;201 for those in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance. The estimated expenditure in a full year is &euro;1 million and the estimated number of young people who will benefit from this measure is 300.</p>  <p>  Young people who qualify for this measure will continue to be encouraged to engage with the employment support services and avail of pro-employment supports and schemes.  A range of activation measures for the under 25&rsquo;s have been developed and improved over recent years, most notably the EU-wide Youth Guarantee Programme and the Youth Employment Support Scheme which I introduced as part of Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department works with Tusla and non-Government organisations to support all vulnerable people including young people who are leaving care, at risk of, or experiencing homelessness, or in insecure situations.</p>  <p>  Protocols are in place in all Intreo Centres to ensure that payments and activation supports for young people in insecure situations such as homelessness are not interrupted and they are advised to register with the Local Authority to engage with Housing Assistance Payment and local homeless services.</p>  <p>  Supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are also available to young people to help with essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Young people who are in vulnerable situations, including homelessness are assessed to see what supports are most suitable for their individual circumstances.  As the needs of this group are complex they require assessment on an individual basis and I believe this is the most appropriate way of helping them to overcome the significant challenges they face.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it, over 50 years of working age life.</p>  <p>  While it was lower in the past when PRSI coverage was less widespread, legislation was introduced in 1997 to increase this threshold to 520 weeks, or 10 years of contributions.  A fifteen year period was allowed pass between that legislation being enacted and the threshold being raised to this level, which would have been sufficient for most people to achieve the required contributions.</p>  <p>  The social welfare system is primarily a contingency-based system, with entitlement based on a number of defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood. </p>  <p>  There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system. </p>  <p>  Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life. For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another. </p>  <p>  A person aged 66 or over with insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for a full rate State Pension (Contributory) may claim a State Pension (Non-Contributory) if they have an income need.  The current maximum weekly personal rate is &euro;237, which is over 95% of the maximum State Pension (Contributory) rate.  While it is means-tested, there are very significant disregards which are to the benefit of claimants, and a significant majority of such pensioners are paid at the full rate. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is because of a long-standing arrangement known as the Common Travel Area (CTA).  The CTA pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on it.  Both the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom are committed to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances and we signed a Memorandum of Understanding to that effect on the 8 May 2019.</p><p>As part of that commitment, the Government also entered into a Convention on Social Security with the Government of the United Kingdom signed on the 1<sup>st</sup>February 2019.Under the terms of the agreement, Irish and British citizens living in either country will maintain the right to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in either country and to access social insurance payments, such as state pension (contributory), in either country.This arrangement will be in place as required, that is, either at the end of the transition period if the UK leaves the EU on the basis of an agreement or immediately in a no deal scenario.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Applicants for illness-related schemes should provide, at the outset, all information they have in relation to medical conditions and the effect of those conditions on their capacity to work or their care needs.</p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy that claim processing is kept under active review, with all possible steps taken to improve processing times and customer service.  This includes the assignment of additional resources, where available, and the review of business processes, to ensure the efficient processing of applications.  As indicated in a reply to a previous question a recent report from the Comptroller an Auditor General notes that the Department meets or exceeds performance standards on most of its schemes.  Illness related schemes given their complexity create particular difficulties, however I am pleased to report that substantial improvements have been made in the processing of the disability /caring schemes in recent months and my department will continue to work to maintain  and embed these improvements. </p>  <p>  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the different qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision-making process.  Delays can occur if a claim is submitted and all the necessary supporting documentation is not included.  If information is required from social security organisations in other jurisdictions, this can also affect processing times.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness includes a range of measures  relating to the provision of emergency accommodation and the range of supports to be provided to households experiencing homelessness.  In addition the Plan places a strong emphasis on Homeless prevention, both for households at risk in the rented sector and home owners.</p>  <p>  The focus of Government remains on preventing homelessness to the greatest extent possible.   Budget 2020 reflects the commitment of the Government in this regard, with an allocation of &euro;166m for homeless services by local authorities this year, an increase of &euro;20m on the 2019 allocation. While much of this funding is used to address families already in homelessness, a significant portion goes towards initiatives aimed at prevention and tenancy sustainment. This funding supports services to prevent families having to enter emergency accommodation and to ensure that those families in emergency accommodation are supported to identify and secure an independent tenancy within the shortest possible timeframe. </p>  <p>  Threshold, the housing charity, already operates the Tenancy Protection Service (TPS) on a national basis.  The service provides advice and support to households living in private rented accommodation who are experiencing tenancy problems, including where a tenancy is at risk of termination. The TPS seeks to protect existing tenancies, keeping people in their home and preventing them from having to access homeless services. This service has been an important contributor to limiting the growth in homelessness.  Following a commitment in the context of Rebuilding Ireland, the Department has been supporting Threshold to deliver these services on an ongoing basis and allocated &euro;800,000 for these purposes in 2019. The Tenancy Protection Service freephone operated by Threshold has been operating nationwide since 2017.</p>  <p>  The Rental Tenancies Board (RTB) is also focusing on education and awareness amongst those living and working in the rental sector. Changes to the legislation, such as the introduction of Rent Pressure Zones, continue to feature heavily in education and information provision to landlords and tenants. The RTB continues to highlight the new requirements for tenancies located within Rent Pressure Zones, as well as promoting the role of the RTB to support tenants and landlords understand these new requirements, such as the RTB RPZ Calculator. Tenants and landlords are encouraged to contact the RTB to find out more information about Rent Pressure Zones, or to find out what to do if they believe they are being charged an incorrect rent.</p></reply>

The accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010) provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements.  </p>  <p>   The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability:</p>  <p>  -  new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;</p>  <p>  -  extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;</p>  <p>  -  material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;</p>  <p>  -  certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings where practicable; and</p>  <p>  new dwellings are visitable.</p>  <p>  Section 1.5. of Part M provides guidance on ensuring that facilities such as lecture/conference facilities in hotels or offices, educational buildings, theatres, cinemas, sports facilities in stadia and sports centres are accessible to and useable for people with a wide range of abilities, e.g. people with vision or hearing impairment, people with intellectual disabilities, people with mental impairment, ambulant disabled people, wheelchair users and people with small children (in buggies).</p>  <p>  In regard to lighting in such facilities, Part M provides that rows and seats should be clearly numbered and well lit to assist people with vision impairment.</p>  <p>  In regard to handrails, Part M provides that stepped access routes to raked seating areas should have handrails where there is an adjacent wall. Where steps lead to seating, a handrail is needed only on the wall side, so as not to obstruct access to the seating. </p>  <p>  Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p>  <p>  Guidance on how to design, build and manage buildings and spaces so that they can be readily accessed and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability  is available in 'Building for Everyone, A Universal Design Approach', a National Disability Authority (NDA) publication, which may be accessed at www.nda.ie.</p>  <p>  The Building Regulations, including Part M requirements, are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p></reply>

The grant, subject to certain conditions, assists households dependent on these supplies with the costs incurred in providing such a supply of water for domestic purposes or rectifying serious deficiencies with an existing supply. </p>  <p>  Details are available from the local authority concerned or on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/water/water-services/rural-water-programme/private-wells.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I announced details of the new Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme 2019-2021. This included an improved funding scheme for individual wells and work is at an advanced stage of development for this scheme. The changes that I have approved to the individual wells grant scheme are as follows:</p>  <p>  -  A maximum grant for rehabilitation works of &euro;3,000 (which represents an increase of 47% on the current maximum grant amount), or where the local authority agrees that the most appropriate solution is to provide a new well, a maximum grant of &euro;5,000;</p>  <p>  -  Recognising the role of the grant in improving quality, the water treatment element (typically filtration and UV filtration) will qualify for 100% funding up to a maximum of &euro;1,000;</p>  <p>  -  Up to 85% of other costs would be met, subject to the total combined maximum costs of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation or &euro;5,000 for a new well.</p>  <p>  I expect that the procedures for applying under this new scheme will be completed shortly when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place.  This will enable circular letters, terms and conditions, guidance and the application forms to issue to local authorities.</p></reply>

The Department has referred to this in the context of its Rural Water Programme and the flexibility of the scheme to cover potentially higher costs on the islands.  </p>  <p>Following consultation with the island communities over the coming months, my Department will be holding bilateral meetings, to discuss issues raised, with all of the relevant Government Departments and other stakeholders, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-12-04a.660.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019120400075#WRM06900"><p>Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas within the framework of the EU Habitats Directive. This has included the establishment of the Peatlands Council, intensive and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters.</p><p>The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme was established in 2011 for active turf cutters arising from the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation and was extended in 2014 to include natural heritage areas. This scheme is applicable to turf cutters who have been affected by the designation of raised bogs as special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas and who fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme. It is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a legal agreement payment of &euro;500. </p><p>2,569 applicants are regularly receiving annual payments under the scheme. There are other affected turf cutters, who may qualify under the scheme, who have not yet applied, and it remains open for these turf cutters to apply. </p><p>While applicants are waiting for relocation sites to be investigated, prepared and developed, they may, on an interim basis, opt for the annual payment of &euro;1,500 (index-linked) or opt to receive an annual supply of up to 15 tonnes of cut turf delivered to their homes. To date, 1,150 deliveries of turf have been made to applicants.</p><p>Of the 2,569 applicants regularly receiving annual payments under the scheme, 263 have applied for relocation to a non-designated bog </p><p>Relocation of turf cutters is a complex process. Notwithstanding this, progress in relocation has been achieved in a number of cases and 72 turf cutters from 11 raised bog designated sites have been relocated to non-designated bogs. A further 4 relocation sites in counties Galway, Roscommon and Westmeath, which will accommodate up to 54 turf cutters, have been developed by my Department and are scheduled to be operational from 2020. Relocation sites for a further 6 special areas of conservation have been identified by the Department and are at various stages of development. These could accommodate up to approximately 50 turf cutters. The Department is still investigating suitable relocation sites for a further 7 raised bog special areas of conservation.</p><p>For certain designated sites, where a suitable relocation site has not been identified or where the identified relocation site cannot accommodate all applicants who have opted for relocation, the 15 year compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme (less any annual payments or the value of turf deliveries received) has been made available to them in the form of a lump sum to enable them to source and purchase bog plots themselves. 61 turf cutters have availed of this option from 8 special areas of conservation and 3 natural heritage areas.</p><p>For a number of the protected sites, the non-designated site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there. In such cases and within the framework of the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, the Department, in consultation with turf cutter representatives, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the Habitats Directive to provide for turf cutting with certain areas of raised bog special areas of conservation. 14 sites are under consideration for the possible application of article 6 of the Directive.</p><p>Details on the number of applicants regularly receiving annual payments under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme and the number who have applied for relocation are set out in the following table.</p><p>Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Site
