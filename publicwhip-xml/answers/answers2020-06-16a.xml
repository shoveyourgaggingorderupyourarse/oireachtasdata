In particular we miss the opportunity to come together to remember those we have lost.  </p>  <p>It is not possible with these current restrictions to organise an appropriate national commemoration.  When the time is right there will be an opportunity for us nationally to remember those who died during this difficult time.

There was a particular focus on the impact of Covid-19 on CSDP Missions and Operations where key concerns have been the safety of EU personnel and appropriate support to host nations. </p>  <p>  Discussions considered topics such as solidarity, responsiveness, resilience and preparedness, capabilities and partnerships with other nations/organisations all in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.  Ministers also discussed the setting up of a Covid-19 Information Sharing Platform to facilitate the exchange of information and lessons learned between member States on military assistance provided in a national or bilateral context in support of civilian authorities' response to the crisis.</p>  <p>  There was a further informal meeting of Defence Ministers today by video conference.  The meeting commenced with a meeting of the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board where there was a stocktake on the various strands of work currently being undertaken by the EDA on behalf of the participating member States.  Among the issues discussed at the informal meeting were the current status on a range of CSDP initiatives, including PESCO Projects and the upcoming strategic Review of PESCO, the European Defence Fund and ongoing discussions on the European Peace Facility.  The meeting also discussed the impact of the Covid Crisis on CSDP missions and operations and the need to reactivate these missions as soon as circumstances and maintaining the safety of our personnel allows.  An initiative on a Strategic Compass designed to guide future work in the area of CSDP so as to deliver on the level of ambition set out in the EU Global Strategy was also discussed.  In my intervention I outlined Ireland's support for CSDP, our priorities and issues in relation to all these initiatives.</p></reply>

In line with the approach to proposals for major acquisitions and the Public Spending Code, the assessment of a proposal to acquire a large aircraft includes consideration of the overall investment rationale. The assessment would consider the demands that may be made of an aircraft and the capabilities it may be expected to be able to supply, together with the associated technical specification and requirements. These requirements would be considered against existing air-based capabilities supplied by the Air Corps and the feasible options to meet any proposed requirements. Acquisition of a large aircraft could potentially provide a range of capabilities not currently available for military use or to meet other State requirements.  This utility would have to be assessed against the significant investment of public funds, in respect of the initial investment and on-going operational costs, which will be considered alongside other spending priorities.</p>  <p>  Pending any detailed examination, it is not possible to state what the cost would be, the type of aircraft or what its range of capabilities could be.  A tender competition would be required to be carried out in accordance with EU Public Procurement legislation.</p></reply>

While the Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining  this agreed strength, the capacity of the Defence Forces to induct and train recruits has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 situation. This has resulted in the postponement of the majority of inductions in the year to date.</p><p>The Defence Forces remain committed to optimising the number of personnel inducted during 2020.  In that context, the military authorities have advised that they are currently finalising plans to re-commence General Service training and recruitment, taking public health guidelines into account. A campaign to re-enlist former members of the Permanent Defence Force, to fill certain vacancies, is also underway.</p><p>In addition, the report of the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) of 2019 contains a range of recommendations aimed at improving work-force planning, recruitment and conditions of service for members of the Defence Forces. A High Level Plan to giver effect to the recommendations of the PSPC is being implemented. </p><p>It should be noted that as the High Level Implementation Plan contains short, medium and long term measures, the full impact of these measures will take time to determine. There are also a range of external variables which impact on recruitment and retention and which can change and these will be carefully monitored to assess their effect as they arise.</p></reply>

A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. The fourth ship in the programme, L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, was commissioned into service in May 2019 reflecting an investment by the Government of over &euro;250 million in the new ships programme since 2010. The four ships are performing well in operational service.  In addition, works on the mid life refit of L&Eacute; Rois&iacute;n are underway and this will be followed by mid life refit works on L&Eacute; Niamh. </p>  <p>  Further to the Off-Shore Patrol Vessels Project, the White Paper also provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV). Planning is underway on this project and it is intended to hold a public tender competition to cover the supply of the MRV.  As with the purchase of any major defence platform and complex project, it requires the finalisation of required capabilities to enable a specification of requirements  to be defined before a tender competition can  can go to the market and work is ongoing in this regard. In addition, the timing and scope of the project will be subject to the public funding available within the overall Defence capital funding envelope The cost of the MRV will only be known once a tender competition is concluded. It is important to note that while the MRV will operate as naval asset, its role is very much a whole of defence one with the capacity to contribute to the wider maritime domain.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government. </p>  <p>  The Naval Service made a significant positive contribution to the Covid 19 crisis with its existing flotilla. It participated in Operation Fortitude in support of the Defence Forces response to Covid 19. It has supplied six ships, to support the interagency response to Covid 19 in Dublin, Cork and Galway.</p>  <p>  The six ships were</p>  <p>-   L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett</p>  <p>  - L&Eacute; James Joyce</p>  <p>  - L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats</p>  <p>  - L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw</p>  <p>  - L&Eacute; Niamh</p>  <p>  - L&Eacute; Eithne.</p></reply>

I am also deeply concerned at the underlying issues of racial inequality and racism that gave rise to protests in many cities across the United States and elsewhere in recent weeks, including here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the United States share strong ties of kinship and enjoy close diplomatic and political relations, as well as enduring economic, cultural and social connections. As a result, I and my officials hold regular and constructive discussions with US officials on a range of issues.</p>  <p>  As part of our regular dialogue, I have raised these issues on two occasions with the US Ambassador, Edward Crawford, both during an initial telephone call and during a meeting on 9 June. I set out our concerns about the circumstances surrounding the death of George Floyd and the underlying issues of racial inequality, as well as concerns about some of the policing responses to peaceful protest. We had a good exchange of views and undertook to stay in ongoing contact in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  I continue to call for a de-escalation of tensions in the US, and a deepening of engagement at the community and political level to address the underlying issues of racial inequality, which have led to such widespread protest. The disturbing events over the past weeks in the US have also sharply brought into focus the need to look hard at our own societies, in Ireland and elsewhere. I welcome the debate it has opened up in Irish society. We must listen to those speaking out about their own experience of racism and exclusion, identify the challenges in our society, and tackle these scourges head-on, collectively and pro-actively.</p></reply>

In particular, plans were put in place to ensure that we continued to provide an emergency service for the issuance of passports in cases of serious illness or death abroad.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service also assisted those whose applications were regarded as urgent. While staff were on site during the pandemic, carrying out this necessary work, they also produced approximately 6,000 additional passports. The additional passports were adult passport renewal applications received online which required minimum staff intervention.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the response to the crisis, personnel from the Passport Service have been and will continue to be redeployed into other essential public service roles, such as assisting the HSE with contact tracing and facilitating the payment of social welfare benefits for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has now started a phased return to full operation. This planning is in line with the wider Government plan to reopen in phases. The Passport Service resumed the processing of non-essential online applications on the 9 June (in Phase 2 of the Government Roadmap) and produced over 12,000 passports in the first week of operation. There are currently 32,000 applications in our system being processed. The Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand, and we believe that we are well-placed to ensure the online service will be meeting its usual turnaround times of approximately two weeks by the end of the month.</p>  <p>  We encourage all applicants to apply via the Passport Online service which has won awards for its user-friendly process, including a NALA award for the use of plain English. If an applicant is not familiar with using a computer, a friend or relative with basic computer skills can help them to apply online &ndash; the process only takes ten minutes to complete. Passport Online can also facilitate social distancing, given that a renewal application for an adult does not require the signature of a witness.</p>  <p>  Passport Online expanded in 2019 to include first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain and Europe. Irish citizens, including children, can also renew their passports online 24/7, from anywhere in the world.</p></reply>

The Government remains in close contact with the European Commission and our EU partners on this matter.</p>  <p>  Over recent weeks, I have had contacts with EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier, as well as with UK counterparts, including in respect of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland. I have stressed the importance of ensuring the full implementation of the Protocol, as agreed. </p>  <p>  It is the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland that ensures that we will avoid a hard border on this island, that the gains of the Good Friday Agreement are protected and the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland's place in it are safeguarded. Mr Barnier has been clear that the EU will continue to monitor closely implementation of the Protocol. Ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement means that the Protocol will be in place from 1 January next year regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK negotiations on the future relationship. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has set out clearly and in detail what needs to be addressed in terms of implementation of the Protocol, in its note published on 30 April. The UK has also set out its approach to implementing the protocol in a paper published on 20 May. What we need now is for the UK to provide the technical detail necessary to make the Protocol fully operational by the end of the transition period. Progress on implementation will provide certainty to citizens and to business which is of crucial importance.</p>  <p>  The Joint Committee met for the second time last Friday and Ireland once again participated as part of the EU delegation. We look forward to future early meetings of the Specialised Committee as it continues its work.</p>  <p>  Full implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol will help to create the confidence that we need across the EU as we build our future partnership with the UK.</p></reply>

These remain under consideration and include: the GDPR right to be forgotten, the possibility of other information being inferred, or inferable, as a result of publication of the names, and whether there have been incidents of members of the roster having suffered harm as a result of being identified. It will also be important to also consider any final concerns raised by individual roster members, who each have data protection and privacy rights, as well as significant other rights and freedoms. </p>  <p>  The list contains the names of persons who volunteered to join a roster without any guarantee of selection for an overseas election observation mission. While it remains my intention that this list is published, this will only happen when I am satisfied that doing so is in compliance with the GDPR and other legal obligations.</p></reply>

This includes in relation to freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture in detention. Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of Ireland's engagement and dialogue with Iran.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the two cases raised, and note with concern that there are reports that the persons in question have been tortured. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees as set out in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Mandela rules.</p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is very important in that regard, and Ireland has regularly raised human rights in Iran at that forum.</p>  <p>  At the most recent Universal Periodic Review of Iran&rsquo;s human rights record at the Human Rights Council in November 2019, Ireland raised concern about the continued harassment, arrest, and arbitrary detention of human rights defenders in Iran, and called on the Iranian Government to release all detainees, who have been imprisoned solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as guaranteed under the ICCPR. Human rights concerns are also discussed in Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral engagement with Iran, and I have raised the need to have an open dialogue on the subject with the Iranian Ambassador. </p>  <p>  The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran is mandated to monitor and investigate human rights violations, and undertake country visits to Iran. It is extremely disappointing that access to Iran has not been granted to the Special Rapporteur by the Iranian authorities to date. Senior officials in my Department raised our concerns about Iran&rsquo;s human rights violations directly with their counterparts in Tehran in February 2020, urging Iran to cooperate with the UN Special Rapporteur, and allow him access into the country. </p>  <p>  The EU consistently pursues human rights issues with Iran, including the right to due process for all, as part of our overall engagement with Iran. Since 2011, the EU has also had in place restrictive measures related to violations of human rights, which both list individuals and entities responsible for grave human rights violations, including many responsible for violations of rights of detainees; and ban the export to Iran of equipment which might be used for internal repression and of equipment for monitoring telecommunications.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU will continue to monitor developments in Iran, and to call on the Iranian Government to make progress in relation to human rights, both in direct contacts with Iranian officials, and at international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

Since the beginning of the pandemic, my Department has assisted over 6,000 citizens to return. We continue to help many other Irish citizens overseas, including approximately 1,000 who have registered an interest in returning home. In certain very exceptional cases, financial assistance can be considered for citizens who require it in order to return home safely. This assistance is in the form of a loan, repayable within 6 months. </p>  <p>  In terms of social protection available to Irish people based abroad, the level provided within each EU Member State is a matter for individual Governments and there are of course differences between EU Member States. The social protection services of EU Member States cannot discriminate between EU citizens living and working in their countries, either in the context of emergency Covid-19 payments or more generally with regard to other social protection supports. </p>  <p>  In Spain, financial supports are available through the national, regional, and local governments and can therefore vary between regions. Our Embassy in Madrid can advise on what supports Irish citizens registered as resident in the Canary Islands may apply for, such as rent relief, unemployment or furlough supports and a recently introduced minimum income scheme for low-income households.</p>  <p>  Any citizens in difficulty abroad, including in the Canary Islands, are encouraged to make contact with their nearest Irish diplomatic mission, in this case the Irish Embassy in Madrid, whereby all possible consular assistance will be made available. This includes facilitating contact with the relevant local authorities, as well as advice which takes into account their particular circumstances.</p></reply>

Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the urgent Government objective of getting assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus.  It must be accepted that the TWSS cannot be adapted to meet the particular circumstances of individual employers or employees.</p>  <p>  In the context of the compelling need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.  The key conditions of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash; </p>  <p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p>  <p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, but extended recently to 1 April 2020.</p>  <p>  The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  The wage subsidy per employee is calculated based on the net pay reported for January and February 2020. The scheme does not distinguish between ordinary wages, shift allowances, overtime, bonuses or commission or between part-time or full-time employees. Moreover, the scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, it follows that the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after that date, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, he or she does not meet the eligibility criteria with the employer as he or she would not have been on the employer&rsquo;s payroll at that date.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will be aware that the Government decided on 5 June 2020 to extend the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) until the end of August.  The intention is to continue to monitor the scheme closely in the coming period.  I expect that decisions will be taken at an appropriate time on next steps for the TWSS beyond end-August.  In this regard, I acknowledge that certain sectors will face particular challenges into the future as we re-open our economy, and this is one of many factors that will inform such future decisions.</p>  <p>  However, there are no plans at the present moment to revisit the core criteria. The TWSS is built upon historic PAYE returns made to Revenue &ndash; this is fundamental to the operational of the scheme which has given support to over 530,000 employees.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-16a.127.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061600005#WRC05500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 71 together.</p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March to support firm viability and preserve the relationship between the employer and employee insofar as is possible by subsidising a portion of the employer wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by the restrictions that have had to be introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>  <p>  When originally announced, it was expected that this economy wide measure would be in place for 12 weeks until mid-June. Having regard to the novel circumstances surrounding the re-opening of the economy as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close, the Government has decided that the TWSS will remain until the end of August.</p>  <p>  The key prescribed conditions of the scheme are that &ndash; </p>  <p>- the business is suffering significant negative  economic impact due to the pandemic and is unable to pay normal wages to employees, but wishes to continue to employ the employees and is making best efforts to continue to pay some wages to the employees, </p>  <p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, but recently extended to before the 1 April 2020.</p>  <p>  In terms of Deputy Andrews' question, employee eligibility for the scheme does not depend on that person being absent from the workplace.  Eligible employees who return to the workplace will continue to be eligible for the TWSS provided that the core criteria for qualification for the scheme continue to be met.</p>  <p>  Similarly, former employees who were on the employer's payroll on 29 February and who subsequently availed of the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) may return to that employment and be eligible for the TWSS.  A person ceases to be eligible for the PUP from the date they return to employment.</p>  <p>  I might add that the position in relation to the TWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay.  The question of an individual&rsquo;s employment entitlements following their resumption of work and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee are matters between the employee and the employer. However, the employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income as close as possible to normal net income for the duration of the Subsidy period.</p>  <p>  Finally, there is no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but for Revenue operational systems reasons the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll. </p></reply>

The system applies equally to all income earners liable to taxation in the State.  As an individual&rsquo;s income increases they move up through the various rates and bands and, as a result, while the levels of take home pay increase overall, the amount of tax paid also increases.  Total income tax receipts account for around 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual tax receipts, thereby making a significant contribution towards the cost of the various Exchequer funded State services, many of which are experiencing additional pressures at this time as a result of the necessary response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Government greatly appreciates the additional efforts of essential workers, front line staff and all those working during this difficult time.  They are making a key contribution to the State-wide response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach has been to focus available resources on initiatives which support those who are no longer in employment or who have a reduced income as well as measures aimed at support employers in retaining staff and restarting businesses as we gradually reopen our economy in line with Ireland's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or contractual terms and conditions of insurance products.</p><p>It is difficult to give a precise answer in relation to the situation mentioned in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  We are all aware that many events have been cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and that this will have a negative financial impact on contractors that would have worked at these events.  Government has brought forward a range of general measures to support businesses and individuals in terms of income support as part of a very significant financial aid package.</p><p>In terms of the specifics of the case of recouping money paid for such insurance it may well depend on the nature of the contract between the contractor and their insurer.  I understand that such insurance contracts may not be related to particular events, but provide cover over a period of time.  Therefore in some cases the contractor may benefit from the insurance taken out in terms of working at future events that may be held.  In addition, whether a contractor can make a claim in relation to the cancellation of the event against their insurance policy due to COVID-19 will also depend on the specifics of the individual policy.  I have repeatedly said  that insurers must treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally and honour those elements of the policies covered in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. However, it is important to note that neither the Government nor the Central Bank have any role in adjudicating on such matters.</p><p>Where a dispute occurs and the policyholder is dissatisfied with the service received by their insurance provider, including in relation to the situation mentioned in this question, then the appropriate channels for resolving the dispute must continue to be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The Deputy will be aware that the FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.  The FSPO can be contacted either by email at <i>info@fspo.ie</i>or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s priority in so far as the TWSS is concerned was, and is, to ensure that all employers experiencing significant negative economic disruption from COVID-19 can register for, and start to receive, payment quickly. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once that is possible. Eligibility for the scheme can be satisfied by an employer once they meet the relevant criteria.</p><p>The TWSS scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector.  This includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce.  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020.  There is no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business has closed for any defined period due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or has continued to trade with employees continuing to work full time or part time, with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income, reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the TWSS. There is, however, no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but, for Revenue operational systems reasons, the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll. If the employer makes an additional payment greater than the difference allowed by the scheme, then the subsidy value refundable to the employer will be reduced by this excess amount when the refund reconciliation is performed by Revenue in due course. The scheme is not prescriptive as regards the hours that must be worked.</p><p>Revenue published detailed guidance on employer eligibility and supporting proofs for the TWSS and it is available on the Revenue website: <i></i>.</p></reply>

The scheme builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. </p>  <p>  It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees.  The core principles of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic, that the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020 and that the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020.  The latter two requirements in particular were critical safeguards against abuse and exploitation of the scheme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I announced an extension of the TWSS until the end of August 2020 and thus, where the employer meets the eligibility conditions for the TWSS, new applications will continue to be accepted by Revenue for businesses that require access to the scheme to retain and rehire employees in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that following a review of cases since the TWSS commenced, it became apparent that a number of employers had been unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and are otherwise tax compliant.  Given the purpose and objective of the scheme, Revenue announced on 24 April 2020, under its care and management provisions, that it would allow such employers access the scheme provided: </p>  <p>  - the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, </p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and </p>  <p>  - the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.</p>  <p>  Where a business qualifies for the scheme under the revised criteria and makes the necessary declaration that it is significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, the wage subsidies under the scheme will be payable for eligible employees in respect of payroll submissions made on or after 24 April 2020, with a pay date on or after 24 April 2020.  These revised arrangements cannot be made retrospective.</p>  <p>  Where a business fails to meet the revised qualifying criteria for TWSS but wishes to further engage with Revenue on the matter, it must provide supporting evidence setting out the rationale for why it should be included in the scheme.  This supporting documentation should be provided via Revenue&rsquo;s myEnquiries system.</p>  <p>  Revenue advises that it does not propose to make any further concessions in relation to compliance with those reporting requirements for the purposes of qualification for the scheme.</p></reply>

The Act provides the Minister for Finance with powers to appoint a date for the Act to come into operation, or to appoint different days to commence different provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  At the end of January, I took the decision that the matter of when to commence the Act should be taken by the next Government.  The background to this decision was a series of meetings with the major insurers where significant concerns were expressed about the early implementation of certain aspects of the Act.  Specifically, it was indicated to me that sufficient time would be needed in relation to the implementation of Sections 8 (Pre&ndash;contractual duties of consumer and insurer) and Section 12 (Renewal of contract of insurance).  In addition, Sections 9 (Proportionate remedies for misrepresentation) and 14 (Duties of consumer and insurer at renewal) are sufficiently interrelated with Section 8 that it is reasonable to consider that the concerns expressed also apply to these sections.  Moreover, the Deputy should note that a general view was expressed by insurers that they also needed a number of months to prepare themselves for the implementation of the sections other than those referred to above.</p>  <p>  My officials have advised me that the sector has indicated to them that if insurers are not provided with sufficient time to implement the requirements necessary to fulfil the obligations of the above mentioned sections, they may be forced to withdraw certain products from the market in order to prioritise others so as to ensure that they are fully compliant with the law.  Officials understand that such a development would most likely to impact the employer/public liability part of the market.  While conscious of the sector&rsquo;s concerns, officials have emphasised to Insurance Ireland the importance of the need for ongoing preparation by the sector for the ultimate commencement of this Act, either on a phased basis or in full.</p>  <p>  Consequently, as I believe that this matter is one to be considered after the formation of the next Government, I cannot currently give any indication of a likely timeline for the commencement of this Act, on a phased basis or in full.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-16a.191.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061600006#WRD04300"><p>At the outset it should be noted that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in those policies. </p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  For example, in relation to commercial van insurance, including for couriers, factors may include those such as the age of the driver and their relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how and where it is used, the claims record, the number of drivers, and the storage and use of the vehicle.  Insurers also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and do not all use the same combination of rating factors, so as a result prices vary across the market.  While I cannot comment on the specific case referenced in the details supplied, a number of these factors may be influencing the ability of the individual courier to secure insurance at a lower price.</p>  <p>  The above said however, it is my understanding that there are a number of brokers and insurers still offering courier van insurance.  Consequently, my view is that it is now more important than ever for those operating in this sector to shop around for their insurance policies.  In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), on its website, recommends that consumers get quotes from a number of insurance companies, including their current one. </p>  <p>  With regard to steps taken by Government to create a more competitive environment in relation to insurance generally, I believe that the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) has done considerable work to reform the insurance market so as to stabilise pricing and availability of insurance.  The impact of this can be seen in particular in relation to private motor insurance, however I accept that more needs to be done in some key areas such as the personal injuries legal environment.  In this regard, the Deputy may recall the Personal Injuries Commission&rsquo;s conclusions that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.  I believe that the discrepancy in award levels is unsustainable and that these should be reduced considerably.  Completion of those recommendations related to the Judicial Council and Law Reform Commission (LRC) is therefore vital if we want to attract more insurers into the Irish market.</p>  <p>  By way of update to the Deputy, I understand that the relevant Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee (PIGC), within the Judicial Council, was established on 28 April and is due to submit its first draft Personal Injuries Guidelines to the Council within six months, as per the requirements of the legislation.  While the Government cannot interfere in the Judicial Council&rsquo;s deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, I would hope that the Guidelines will take into account the Personal Injury Commission&rsquo;s benchmarking report, and can come into operation as soon as possible following their submission to the Judicial Council.  In return for lower and more consistent award levels, I believe insurers have to significantly reduce their premium levels and broaden their risk horizons.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group is continuing to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  The cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations should include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for small businesses, like the one referenced, and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

Furthermore, officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. All the banks, Bank of Ireland included, have continued to evolve and expand the supports they have available and I would expect that this process will continue.</p><p>Bank of Ireland has introduced a wide variety of solutions designed to help both personal and business customers affected by the COVID-19 crisis including mortgage breaks, cash flow supports for businesses and banking arrangements for customers who are cocooning/self-isolating. </p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that as Minister for Finance, I am precluded from intervening in how Bank of Ireland manages its day-to-day business and relationship with any of its customers.  Decisions in this regard are solely the responsibility of the board and management of the bank which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.  The independence of the banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally.  These frameworks which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, officials in the Department have requested a comment from Bank of Ireland in relation to the manner in which it is managing its branch network during the current crisis and have received the following response:</p><p>&ldquo;Due to COVID-19 Bank of Ireland has made a number of operational changes to safeguard critical services during the pandemic, respond to a significant shift in how customers are banking, and support social distancing requirements.</p><p>&quot;To safeguard critical services we prioritised one hundred and sixty one of our larger branches nationwide, as well as our contact centres and online banking which have seen a surge in use over recent months.  One hundred and one mainly smaller locations, which had seen a sharp drop in usage, were closed.  Colleagues from these locations have been supporting our contact centres and online services manage high volumes of requests, as well as our larger branches where social distancing can be better maintained.</p><p>&quot;We're continuing to see shifts in customer behaviour towards online banking channels, and social distancing requirements remain in place.  Our focus therefore remains on protecting the prioritised services across one hundred and sixty one branches, telephone and online banking, while keeping all developments under active review.&quot;</p><p>I note that, subsequent to receiving this response from the BOI, the bank issued a press release on 8 June announcing that it was reopening the majority of the relevant branches highlighting that branches in colleges, hospitals and airports will remain closed.

In that regard, an individual&rsquo;s tax residence status is determined by reference to his or her presence in the State during a particular tax year.  For example, an individual will be considered tax resident in the State if they are present for:</p>  <p>-   183 days or more in a tax year; or</p>  <p>  - 280 days or more in a tax year and the preceding tax year when taken together, with a minimum of 30 days in each year. </p>  <p>  An individual&rsquo;s liability to Irish income tax is determined by reference to the source of his or her income and his or her Irish tax residence, ordinary residence and domicile status for a particular year. </p>  <p>  Once an individual has been tax resident in the State for three tax years, he or she will also be considered ordinarily resident from the fourth year. </p>  <p>  Domicile is a legal concept and is not defined in tax legislation.  Every person must have a domicile and a person can only have one domicile at any particular time.  An individual is born with a domicile of origin, usually the domicile of his or her father.  However, it is possible for an individual to acquire a domicile of choice, but this appears to be outside of the current question raised. </p>  <p>  An Irish resident and domiciled individual is taxable on his or her worldwide income.  Generally, non-residents are only taxable in respect of income from Irish sources.  However, individuals who are not resident but who are ordinarily resident may also be liable to Irish income tax in respect of certain non-Irish sources.  This is subject to any relief being provided by the terms of a relevant Double Taxation Agreement.</p>  <p>  An Irish resident but non-domiciled individual is liable to Irish income tax on his or her Irish source income and foreign income to the extent that it is remitted.</p>  <p>  An individual who is not resident but is ordinarily resident and not domiciled in the State will be liable to Irish tax on his or her Irish income and foreign income to the extent it is remitted.  Income from an employment, all the duties of which are performed outside the State is not liable to Irish income tax, even if remitted.</p>  <p>  An individual who is not resident, and not ordinarily resident, is liable to Irish income tax on his or her Irish source income only.  This applies regardless of his or her domicile status.</p>  <p>  A domicile levy may apply to an Irish domiciled individual where certain conditions are satisfied.  Further information on domicile and the domicile levy can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website - available here.</p>  <p>  Existing Revenue guidance states that where an individual is prevented from leaving the State on his or her intended day of departure due to extraordinary natural occurrences or an exceptional third party failure or action &ndash; none of which could reasonably have been foreseen and avoided &ndash; the individual will not be regarded as being present in the State for tax residence purposes for the day after the intended day of departure provided the individual is unavoidably present in the State on that day due only to &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; circumstances. </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; has been updated to consider those cases who as a result of COVID-19 have had a departure from the State restricted directly as a result of the emergency situation.  In any case where a taxpayer relies upon &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo;, it will be necessary for him or her to be able to appropriately support this position (i.e. information/documentation in relation to how a departure from the state has been prevented due to restrictions in place).</p>  <p>  Therefore, where an individual is present in the State in 2020, his or her tax residence position should be determined with regard to his or her presence in the State, while having regard to the &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; position.  The guidance on &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; is included on the COVID-19 section of Revenue&rsquo;s website - available here. </p></reply>

HTB was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of the &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo; and was due to terminate on 31 December 2019.  However, in Finance Act 2019, I provided for an extension of the scheme, in its present form, for a further two-year period up to 31 December 2021.  This extension aligns with the timeline envisaged for building more homes in Rebuilding Ireland. </p><p>HTB has been the subject of two independent reviews: an impact assessment (2017), and a full Cost Benefit Analysis (2018), both carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. </p><p>The report of the impact assessment was published as part of Budget 2018 documents and is available at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The report of the Cost Benefit Analysis was published on the day of Budget 2019, in the Department of Finance Report on Tax Expenditures, and is available at the following link: </p><p><i>www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2019/Documents/Tax%20Expenditures%20Report%20Budget%202019.pdf</i>.</p><p>An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis.  One of the main aims of the policy underpinning the design of HTB was to help encourage the building of additional new properties.  By restricting the scheme solely to new dwellings and new self-builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes will encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. </p><p>If the scheme were also available for second hand properties, such an extension would have little or no effect on the provision of additional supply, and would consist primarily of &lsquo;economic deadweight&rsquo; in terms of incentive effect.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost housing supply.  Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention.  Given these considerations, there are no plans at the present moment to extend the Help to Buy scheme to second hand properties.</p></reply>

From this date, all banks offering payment accounts were required to offer an account with basic features free of charge for at least one year to consumers who do not already have a bank account.  These basic features include an ATM card, direct debits and the ability to pay for goods and services online. </p>  <p>  This means that unbanked customers are able to open a basic bank account whatever their personal financial situation and I would encourage anyone who doesn't have access to a credit union account or An Post account to contact a bank about opening a basic bank account.</p>  <p>  Where retailers are accepting a limited range of payment options, consumers must be informed of the payment options available in advance of a transaction.  This can be achieved, for example, by displaying signs at the till and at the store entrance.

Under the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation the supply of building materials is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.  Member states are not permitted to apply a VAT rate lower than the standard rate to building materials.  By way of special derogation from the general rule, however, Ireland is permitted to continue to apply a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks but this reduced rate cannot be reduced below 12%. </p>  <p>  Construction services that consist of the "renovation and repairing of private dwellings, excluding materials which account for a significant part of the value of the service supplied" can benefit from the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%.  This means that where a building contractor carries out home improvements and the materials cost does not exceed two-thirds of the cost of the improvements then the reduced rate of 13.5% applies to the total construction service.  A consequence of this is that a VAT registered building contractor will generally be entitled to recover VAT at the 23% standard rate on most building materials purchased while the contractor is only liable to charge VAT at the 13.5% reduced rate on the total supply (including the materials and the labour elements of the job) to the homeowner.  The difference in rates between the 23% input VAT and the 13.5% output VAT should normally be reflected in the VAT-inclusive cost to the homeowner. </p>  <p>  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.  Tax relief in general can be a blunt instrument and in this case the grant scheme introduced by my colleague the Minister for Housing Planning and Local Government would seem to be the better approach in supporting affected homeowners to carry out the necessary remediation work.</p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p>  <p>  I refer the Deputy to my  previous responses to Parliamentary Questions  on this issue, most recently questions  9973/20 on 9 June, 8693/20 on 3 June, and 7016/20 on 20 May. </p>  <p>  The cycle to work scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, there are no records centrally available on the number of people availing of the scheme.  The Deputy may wish to note that a series of questions to individual Departments on 9 June sought the number of persons in each Department who availed of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The legislation only allows for one purchase of a bicycle in respect of an employee in a five-year period irrespective of whether the bicycle was used for the full period or not. Any deviation from the current self-administration system would involve additional administrative procedures for either or both Revenue and employers in relation to the verification of loss, theft, insurance recovery, etc. As this runs counter to the administrative simplicity of the existing provisions, it would not be appropriate to alter the existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Anyone obtaining a bicycle under the scheme would therefore be advised to ensure it is covered by insurance.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of child seats and trailers in the scheme or the extension of the scheme beyond employees would create an additional cost and that cost must be recovered elsewhere. For that reason, while the scheme is kept under review by officials, I have no plans at present for its expansion.  </p>  <p>  Finally, as Minster for Finance I do not offer any grant schemes for personal transportation. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is responsible for electrical vehicle grants and comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. </p></reply>

It is available to Irish and international film production companies that are resident in the State or in an EEA State and carry on business in the State through a branch or subsidiary. The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.</p><p>Finance Act 2018 introduced a short-term, tapered regional uplift. The regional uplift will be phased out on a tiered basis with 5% available in years 1 (2019) and 2 (2020), 3% in year 3 (2021), 2% in year 4 (2022), and reducing to 0% from year 5 on.  </p><p>The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs, to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector. The regions availing of the uplift is limited to areas in Ireland sanctioned to receive regional aid under the EU regional aid guidelines.</p><p>The Government is fully aware of the unprecedented impact that the COVID-19 is having not only on the audiovisual sector, but also on the wider economy. In this regard a range of measures have been introduced to provide supports to those who need it, including supports for the cultural sector such as: forward the payment of grants awarded this year to ensure financial commitments can be met; waiving eligibility requirements which no longer apply due to the COVID-19 crisis; and an initiative to support artistic and creative life during the COVID-19 crisis. Details of these measures may be found at the following link: <i></i></p><p>In addition to the current supports in place, my officials are examining a range of possible measures to ensure that the economy is in a position to recover while maintaining a stable tax base, including the proposal for amendments to the regional uplift.

The relief is scheduled to end on 31 July 2020 but there is provision for an extension if this is required following a review and consultation with Member States.</p>  <p>  Following a request from my Department, Revenue has also implemented, on an administrative basis, the application of the zero rate of VAT to the domestic supply of personal protection equipment, ventilators, thermometers, hand sanitisers and oxygen as necessary to combat COVID-19 when supplied to hospitals, nursing homes, GP practices and the like, for use in the delivery of COVID-19 related health care services to their patients.  This concessionary treatment will apply until 31 July, subject to review.  The scope of the relief corresponds with the relief on the importation of these goods by the bodies specified in the Commission Decision.  </p>  <p>  Any further extension of zero rating to cover supplies of medical equipment and/or personal protection equipment to dentists and other sectors and businesses would require a change in legislation at EU level; the VAT Directive would not permit a legislative measure for the application of the zero rate of VAT to such supplies and there are no grounds in the Commission Decision that would support the adoption of such a measure, even on a temporary basis. </p></reply>

In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. This general consumer protection framework continues to apply in relation to any Covid-19 related matter, or indeed in relation to any other issue which arises between a consumer and a lender and it places a number of obligations on all regulated lenders including the obligation to act honestly, fairly, transparently and professionally, taking account of the rights and interests of the consumer, at all stages of the mortgage process and including when granting mortgage credit. </p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. A loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.  The Central Bank has also indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The then Government decided to appeal the Commission&rsquo;s decision to the European Courts in November 2016. The European Commission&rsquo;s decision also required that the State recover the alleged State aid. </p><p>The &euro;8.4m in external costs have been incurred by all the State parties involved in the case namely the Department of Finance, Revenue, NTMA, Central Bank and CSSO. </p><p>The costs incurred by the State can be generally broken into two components &ndash; costs associated with the recovery of the alleged State aid and costs associated with the State&rsquo;s appeal of the European Commission&rsquo;s decision to the European Courts. </p><p>I will first provide detail on costs incurred in relation to the recovery process, in line with the specific information sought. Of the total expenditure of &euro;8.4m, approximately &euro;4m relates to the recovery process. </p><p>Individual State entities are responsible for their specific procurement activities. I understand that solicitor firms drawn from legal framework panels established following competitive tendering processes provided the external legal support in relation to the recovery process and in the case of one State entity with external legal support also provided by Senior Counsel. </p><p>In relation to the process undertaken in my Department, a competitive tender process for the appointment of a panel of legal advisors to the Department of Finance was completed in April 2014, and again in June 2018. General Agreements are in place between the successful solicitors&rsquo; firms and the Department. A further competitive tender process among the firms on the 2014 panel was run in 2016 to select a legal advisor for the Apple case, in which William Fry was successful. William Fry assisted with the design, negotiation and formulation of the bespoke and complicated escrow legal agreement with the firm concerned to provide the basis for the recovery of the alleged State aid and to provide general assistance. </p><p>The legal services agreement allows for the extension of that contract where the services of the company continue to be required by the Department. The contract has been extended on a number of occasions, most recently in June 2020.  The basis on which fees in respect of William Fry are paid is set out in the General  Agreement and are at an hourly rate. These rates are considered commercially sensitive and I am not in a position to make this information available. </p><p>Secondly, I will provide further detail on the process around costs incurred in relation to the State&rsquo;s appeal of the European Commission&rsquo;s decision to the European Courts. </p><p>As regards this aspect, the State is represented by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office (CSSO) and Counsel in the ordinary way. All external Counsel retained by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office were nominated by the Attorney General. EU procurement obligations and national tendering guidelines exclude all of the services involved. </p><p>With the exception of the specific circumstances which I outline further below, fees paid by the CSSO to Counsel were processed by the CSSO in the same manner as all Counsels&rsquo; fees &ndash; that is, according to internal CSSO procedures which includes a value for money appraisal being carried out by the CSSO and the Office of the Attorney General and, if required, sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure.</p><p>Professional fees discharged by the CSSO fall into two categories:  </p><p>a.  External Counsel </p><p>b.  Expert Witnesses  </p><p>In relation to External Counsel, the only fees agreed in advance were Counsels&rsquo; brief fee for the oral hearing before the General Court in Luxembourg which took place in September 2019. A brief fee was agreed by the CSSO and was based on an initial estimate provided.  Advice from the State Claims Agency, NTMA was provided to the CSSO prior to agreeing these fees. Advance sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure was also obtained prior to agreeing this fee. </p><p>In relation to Expert Witnesses these fees were agreed in advance. </p><p>Services provided by expert witness before the oral hearing stage were dealt with by way of an hourly rate which was advised in advance and provided to the Department of Finance on engagement. The prior sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure was obtained prior to the CSSO paying these fees.  </p><p>Expert witness fees for the oral hearing were also agreed in advance. An estimate was provided to the CSSO and the prior sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure was obtained.</p><p>The basis of calculation for Counsels&rsquo; fees paid by the CSSO is by way of an assessment on a per worked item &ndash; for example brief, opinion, drafting a pleading &ndash; not an hourly rate.</p><p>The basis of calculation for experts&rsquo; fees has been by way of an hourly rate. However, for the attendance of the experts at the oral hearing an additional fee for disbursements was paid and in respect of one expert their hourly fees for attendance at the oral hearing was capped at an agreed amount. </p><p>The appeal of the Commission&rsquo;s decision to the European Courts involved sourcing Counsel and specific experts where required for the provision of specialised and detailed legal and taxation advices given the complexity of the case. In respect of Counsel&rsquo;s fees and fees for expert witnesses, the amount paid was considered by the office of the Attorney General and the CSSO to be fair and reasonable.</p><p>Advice from the State Claims Agency, NTMA was sought in relation to Counsels&rsquo; brief fee for the oral hearing before the General Court in Luxembourg, as referred to above, and a request by counsel for a review of other fees paid in the case.</p><p>The advice of a legal cost accountant was not sought for the expert witness fees. </p></reply>

In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p>  <p>  Within the parameters of this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.  It can be noted that the FAQ indicates that lenders may extend the period of a mortgage Approval in Principle where an individual&rsquo;s circumstances have not materially changed as a result of COVID-19. The BPFI state that this will likely be for 3-6 months, but it may vary depending on the lender&rsquo;s assessment of an individual&rsquo;s circumstances. However, if a borrower's circumstances have materially changed as a result of Covid-19, the BPFI advises that lenders may keep the application open on its system for a period of time; but this again may vary depending on the lender&rsquo;s assessment of an individual&rsquo;s circumstances. After this period of time, the BPFI states that the lender will undertake a review of the application which will likely include a request for the individual to provide an update on their employment and income situation.</p>  <p>  More generally it can also be noted that the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

Those whose estimated gross income is less than &euro;25,000 for a single person, or &euro;35,000 for a couple, can apply for a deferral of 50% of the LPT charge. In addition, the gross income amounts for certain property owners with an outstanding mortgage can be increased by 80% of the amount of the mortgage interest payments. Where a deferral is in place, the outstanding liability automatically attaches as a charge on the property and must be paid before the property is sold.

It is a tax relief incentive scheme that provides tax relief for investment in certain corporate trades and is targeted at job creation and retention for firms in their first seven years of market operation or before that point. </p><p>Generally, companies older than seven years should  be in a position to raise funding without State support, either from existing investors or from financial institutions. However, such companies may still use the EII if they are expanding into a new product or market and are looking to raise more than 50% of their average annual turnover in the previous five years.  Alternatively, they may avail of EII if they are still carrying on the same activity that they originally raised funding for (for example, in the case of R&amp;amp;D which is still ongoing) or where the additional fund raising was foreseen in their original business plan (for example, the business plan foresaw Phase one, Phase two and Phase three fund raising). </p><p>In 2018, I commissioned a report on EII which confirmed that market failures continued in the provision of risk capital for start-up companies. </p><p>The report, which was carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants, may be found at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, subsequently the EII has been subject to significant changes in recent Finance Acts including a substantial redraft in Finance Act 2018 and changes aimed at:</p><p>-streamlining the application and approval process requirements; </p><p>- providing full income tax relief (40%) in the year in which the investment is made. This compares with current arrangements where 30% relief is provided upon the initial investment and a further 10% is given after Year 3 subject to certain conditions; and</p><p>- increasing the investment limit from &euro;150k to &euro;250K and to &euro;500k in the case of those who invest for a minimum period of 10 years.</p><p>As a state aid, EII operates under the EU General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER).  Article 21 of GBER allows Member States to incentivise investment in SMEs which have been in operation for less than seven years with certain exceptions.

In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p>  <p>  Within the parameters of this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. In this context, a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.  It should also be noted that the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.</p></reply>

Revenue has also acknowledged that some businesses may have difficulty in completing accurate returns due to the pandemic and in such circumstances advises that they submit a best estimate, which can be amended at a later date if necessary.

The property rental income and gains are exempt from tax within the REIT, they are taxed instead at the investor level when distributed.</p>  <p>  Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than those distributed to certain limited classes of investors such as pensions and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.  The distributions are subject to a DWT at 25% from 1 January 2020, prior to this date the rate applicable was 20%. Information in respect of dividends from shares in REITs is not separately identified from other shares. Part 25A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&ldquo;TCA 1997&rdquo;) requires that 85% of all property income profits are distributed annually to investors. Any income or gains arising to the REIT which is not in respect of the REITs property rental business is subject to corporation tax.</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2016 introduced the Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) regime. The regime provides that the profits arising to an Irish fund from Irish property remain within the charge to Irish tax. An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of the assets is derived from real estate assets in the State. Generally, where a unit holder receives value from the IREF an IREF withholding tax of 20% will apply.</p>  <p>  Foreign investors from tax treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of any DWT on REIT distributions (currently 25%) or IREF withholding tax (currently 20%) if the relevant tax treaty allows for this.  The taxation of distributions varies from treaty to treaty, but Ireland commonly retains the right to approximately 15% tax on gross dividends paid from that state.</p>  <p>  Irish resident REIT investors are required to pay tax at their marginal rate of taxation on any distributions they receive on a self-assessment basis, with a credit available for any DWT deducted. Irish resident IREF investors may be subject to exit tax at a rate of 41% which is deducted at source by the IREF.  </p>  <p>  Given the interaction with tax treaties, and because information is not available in relation to potential future REIT and IREF distributions to investors, an accurate estimate of any potential revenue from an increase in the withholding tax rates cannot be made.</p></reply>

Examination currently underway by the OECD, as part of the ongoing BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) project, of a number of potential policy approaches to international tax reform proposals, including minimum effective rates, demonstrate the complexity and challenges of designing and implementing such reform proposals.  OECD analysis suggests that there can be significantly different policy outcomes depending on the design approaches taken which in turn has implications for possible revenue yield.  Furthermore, yield predictions would be also impacted by the consequential behaviour of companies, particularly in relation to their decisions to locate and invest in Ireland, which would become clearer more in the medium to longer term than in the immediate timeframe.</p></reply>

As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax. Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. </p><p>In 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)). The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition.</p><p>During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS. The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation. The research paper, available on the ESRI website (<i></i><i><font color="#0000FF">)</font></i>, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland. A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios). In each case, the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined.  While the scenarios do not fully capture the parameters outlined in his question the Deputy may find them informative.</p><p>In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters outlined in the Deputy's question, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose. This would be a significant undertaking that would take considerable time and resources to complete. It should also be noted that the HFCS does not include specific data on the global assets for those domiciled or ordinarily resident and the domestic assets for those resident for tax purposes. As such, any estimate on the yield obtained from HFCS data would not fully capture the parameters outlined in the Deputy's question.  It is therefore not possible for me to provide the revenue estimate sought in this PQ.</p></reply>

This concept is a much more permanent one than that of residence. Every person must have a domicile and a person can only have one domicile at any particular time.  An individual is born with a domicile of origin, usually the domicile of his or her father but it is possible for an individual to acquire a domicile of choice.</p>  <p>  An Irish resident and domiciled individual is taxable on his or her worldwide income.  Generally, non-residents are only taxable in respect of income from Irish sources. However, individuals who are not resident in the State, but who are ordinarily resident in the State, may also be liable to Irish income tax in respect of certain non-Irish sources.  This is subject to any relief being provided by the terms of a relevant Double Taxation Agreement.</p>  <p>  An Irish resident but non-domiciled individual is liable to Irish income tax on his or her Irish source income and foreign income to the extent that it is remitted to the State.</p>  <p>  An individual who is not resident in the State, but who is ordinarily resident and not domiciled in the State, will be liable to Irish tax on his or her Irish income and foreign income to the extent it is remitted.  However, income from an employment, all the duties of which are performed outside the State is not liable to Irish income tax, even if it remitted to the State.</p>  <p>  An individual who is both not resident and not ordinarily resident in the State is liable to Irish income tax on his or her Irish source income only. This applies regardless of his or her domicile status.</p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question set out in question number 11449/20, the matter is quite complex but the following sets out a summary of the likely position.</p>  <p>  An individual who is tax resident under either the 183 or 280 day test and who is also domiciled in the State is chargeable to Irish tax on his or her worldwide income and capital gains.  This is subject to any provisions of a relevant Double Taxation Agreement.  Thus, an augmentation of the residence rules would not yield any additional taxes on the basis that such individuals already have an unlimited liability to tax in the State.</p>  <p>  An individual who is not tax resident under either the 183 or 280 day test and who is ordinarily resident and domiciled in the State will be taxable on their worldwide income with exceptions in relation to certain foreign source income.  This is to ensure that, as far as possible, only sources of income for which a taxing right has been allocated to the State under the terms of a Double Taxation Agreement are within the charge to Irish tax.  To the extent that such income is not within the charge to Irish tax, there is no requirement to report such amounts to Revenue. Thus, there is no way of quantifying any additional tax which might accrue to the State should the statutory residence tests be augmented as suggested by the Deputy.  Even if such an augmentation were to be given legislative effect, the individuals affected are likely to be tax resident elsewhere and there is no guarantee that the State would be allocated a taxing right on such foreign sources of income.  This could mean that no additional taxes might accrue to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Non-domiciled individuals are subject to tax on what is known as the remittance basis of taxation.  This means that they are taxable on Irish sourced income and on foreign sourced income to the extent that it is remitted to the State.  A legislative change to the tax residence rules will not change the basis of taxation for such individuals and, thus, no additional taxes would accrue to the Exchequer.  This is due to the fact that the charge to tax in such cases is driven by the individuals&rsquo; non-domicile status rather than their domestic residence position. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the abolition of the remittances basis of taxation (question number 11440/20), it is not possible to provide an estimate of the revenue that would be accrued if this treatment discontinued, as there is no statutory obligation on those availing of the remittance basis of taxation to make an annual return of his or her un-remitted income and gains. It is also important to bear in mind that if the remittance basis of taxation ceased, the State may not have an automatic taxing right on the sources of unremitted income and gains in all cases.  The provisions of any relevant Double Taxation Agreement in place between the State and either the source state or state of residence of the taxpayer would determine any such taxing right.</p></reply>

The independent Indecon Consultants report on the Taxation of Vacant Residential Property presented a detailed evidence-based assessment of vacancy rates in areas in which the demand for housing is most acute. This assessment suggests that the vacancy rate in these areas is significantly lower than the national average and has fallen in recent years. </p>  <p>  Indecon Consultants did not recommend the introduction of a residential vacant property tax, as they did not believe it would be an effective response to deal with housing shortages. Indecon&rsquo;s view was that the very low vacancy rates in the areas of greatest demand for housing, particularly in terms of medium-term vacancy, indicated that the potential for a vacant property tax to increase housing supply was very limited and could represent a distraction from the need to significantly accelerate the building of new social housing, affordable housing and the facilitation of other housing supply.</p></reply>

Of particular importance is the work of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which was formally established in April and is due to present its draft guidelines to the Judicial Council by the end of October. I expect that more consistent award levels for personal injuries will help to reduce legal costs over time as there will be less incentive to litigate. In addition, I believe that insurers recognise the need to reflect any savings that result from a reduction in award levels in lower prices and a broader risk appetite.</p></reply>

For example, your lender may spread your repayments over the remaining term of the mortgage/loan, to allow you to repay it within the original term. This means that you will have to pay higher repayments (spread out) over the remaining term of the loan. Alternatively, your lender may offer you the option to extend the term of the loan by the length of the payment break. This spreads your repayments over a longer period. Both options mean your loan will cost you more overall. Your lender should let you know what the additional costs are likely to be.&rdquo;</p><p>The full CBI Covid-19 Consumer FAQ section can be found at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, it is important that I highlight for the Deputy that as Minister for Finance, I am precluded from intervening in how PTSB manages its day-to-day business and relationship with any of its customers.  Decisions in this regard are solely the responsibility of the board and management of the bank which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of the banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p></reply>

Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed very quickly, having regard to the objective of getting financial assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p>  <p>  The TWSS applies where the employer demonstrates to Revenue&rsquo;s satisfaction that, by reason of Covid-19 and the resultant disruption to the conduct of business, commerce, there will occur in the period 14 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 at least a 25 per cent reduction either in the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or in customer orders being received by the employer.  The scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector. This includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continued to operate and employ their workforce.</p>  <p>  A key eligibility criterion for the scheme requires the employer must make a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.  In the case of an employer that is funded by Pobal, the State funding of the employer must be taken into account for the purposes of determining the turnover of the business.  If that turnover meets the &ldquo;the minimum 25% reduction test&rdquo;, then the organisation qualifies for the scheme; if it doesn&rsquo;t meet the 25% reduction test, it doesn&rsquo;t qualify.</p></reply>

However, as the Deputy may be aware given the current COVID-19 crisis on 18 March I met with the Chief Executives of the five major retail banks and the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI). The banks have assured me that they are working to ensure a wide range of credit, cash flow and supply chain supports are offered to businesses who are trying to manage the pressures arising from COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Further to this, An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar T.D. and I, along with the Minister for Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation, Heather Humphreys T.D., met with the Chief Executives of the five Irish major retail banks on 11 May. The Taoiseach emphasised the important role of the banking sector in supporting the gradual re-opening of the Irish economy by ensuring a flow of credit to businesses as they begin to trade again, in line with the government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business.</p>  <p>  We welcomed the ongoing work of the banks in helping business customers and mortgage customers impacted by COVID-19, which included the initial three month payment-breaks that allowed households and businesses to defer some of their most significant outgoings. On 30 April the members of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) announced their intention to extend these payment breaks to six months for households and businesses which require it.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers&rsquo; best interests and in line with regulatory requirements.  Payment breaks give customers the opportunity to postpone or reduce their repayments on their mortgage, personal or business loans, providing breathing space for borrowers from the severe income shock many households and businesses are experiencing.</p>  <p>  The main concern of the Government currently is to ensure that SMEs have access to sufficient liquidity, and that access to credit for SMEs is maintained. The Government has announced a range of measures to assist companies deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 restrictions, and to ensure that they have access to sufficient liquidity, including loan schemes to assist SMEs.  On 2 May I announced a &euro;2 billion Credit Guarantee Scheme to support COVID-19 affected business. This guarantee will give the participating lenders a high level of comfort and help them to continue to lend to SMEs that will be viable after this crisis passes but need access to credit during this difficult time.</p></reply>

In addition, I stress the need for insurers to recognise the need to reflect any savings that result from a reduction in the cost of claims in lower prices and a broader risk appetite.  In doing so, this should increase the availability of insurance to community and not-for-profit organisations such as the one the Deputy referred to in her question.</p></reply>

In this regard, a key change was a number of amendments to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.  In addition, one of the key achievements of the CIWG is increased coordination and cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry with regard to tackling fraud.   There has also been recent successes under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner has decided for operational reasons to have insurance fraud cases investigated at divisional level, as a general rule. It is felt that this will enable a more local focus to be brought to such cases.  This approach is aligned with a general divisional-focused Garda model and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.</p>  <p>  In summary, the key outstanding challenge to satisfactorily resolve the cost and availability of insurance issues facing businesses is a recalibration of award levels downwards.  If this is done and more moderate awards are applied consistently this should have a very positive impact on the cost of doing business.</p></reply>

However, it should be noted that the ECB&rsquo;s active asset purchase programmes also extend to the purchase of private sector assets. These purchases include covered bonds and asset-backed securities issued/originated by Irish banks, and corporate sector bonds issued by Irish non-bank corporations.</p><p>With respect to purchases of Irish sovereign debt, there are two active Eurosystem quantitative easing programmes, which involve purchases of Irish sovereign debt in the secondary market: (i) the Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP), and (ii) the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). Purchases under these programmes are conducted in a decentralised manner by the national central banks (NCBs) of the Eurosystem, with each NCB buying the sovereign bonds of its jurisdiction in a proportion reflecting its respective share in the ECB capital key[1], with the ECB also purchasing alongside each National Central Bank (NCB), but in smaller amounts[2]  .</p><p>The Securities Market Programme is a legacy asset purchase programme, but was not a quantitative easing measure, as the liquidity created through the purchases of assets was re-absorbed by the ECB via liquidity-absorbing open market operations. While purchases are no longer conducted, there remain Irish sovereign debt holdings under this programme that are being held to maturity, and as such, some detail has been included below. </p><p>Mechanism for the sharing of monetary income</p><p>Monetary Income is the income accruing to NCBs from performing Eurosystem monetary policy operations.  The amount of each NCB&rsquo;s monetary income, i.e. net income (income and expense) earned on Eurosystem monetary policy operations, is determined by measuring the actual annual income that derives from the ear-markable assets held against its liability base. </p><p>Monetary Income is shared annually, and each Eurosystem NCB receives monetary Income according to its share in the key for subscription to the ECB&rsquo;s capital i.e. each Eurosystem NCB is entitled to its share in the ECB capital key.  However, if the income actually booked was higher/lower than their ECB capital key share, the reallocation process is performed with clearing and settlement done by the ECB. </p><p>The ECB is not part of the Monetary Income reallocation scheme.  The ECB earns income on monetary policy securities held, which is distributed to NCBs via the regular profit distribution rules.</p><p>Securities Markets Programme (SMP) </p><p>Total Eurosystem SMP holdings of Irish sovereign bonds stood at &euro;3.0 billion in book value terms as at 31 December 2019, and the holdings had an average remaining maturity of 1.6 years at that time. All purchases under the SMP are held on a shared-risk basis, which also means that all income is shared via the monetary income scheme mentioned above and redistributed amongst euro area NCBs according to their ECB capital key share. In 2019, the Central Bank of Ireland earned &euro;53.5 million of interest income on holdings in the SMP portfolio.</p><p>Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP)</p><p>The securities covered by the PSPP include (i) sovereign bonds (held at own-risk) and recognised agencies, and (ii) bonds issued by international organisations and multilateral development banks located in the euro area (held with shared risk).</p><p>Total Eurosystem PSPP holdings of Irish sovereign bonds stood at &euro;33.78 billion in book value terms as at end-May 2020, and the holdings had a weighted average maturity of 8.83 years at that time. </p><p>Under the PSPP, the majority of Irish sovereign bond purchases are conducted by the Central Bank of Ireland, as per the modalities of the programme, and are held at the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s own-risk. As of end-2019, the Central Bank of Ireland held &euro;29.5 billion (market value) of Irish government bonds under the PSPP, versus total Eurosystem holdings of &euro;32.7 billion, or circa 90% of the total purchases. </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland earned &euro;208.3 million of interest income on holdings of securities in the PSPP portfolio.  The fact that the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s holdings of Irish sovereign bonds in this portfolio are held at own-risk, means that the majority of the interest income earned on this portfolio is not subject to monetary income sharing across the Eurosystem, and ultimately contributes to the overall income of the Central Bank of Ireland, the surplus of which is payable to the Exchequer. </p><p>Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP)</p><p>Total Eurosystem PEPP holdings of Irish sovereign bonds stood at &euro;3.0 billion in book value terms as at end-May 2020, and the holdings had a weighted average maturity of 7.95 years at that time. </p><p>There is no information publicly available at this point on the interest earned on purchases of public sector securities under the PEPP. However, similar to the PSPP, the majority of Irish sovereign bond purchases will be conducted by the Central Bank of Ireland, and held at own-risk.</p><p>For more information on the Asset Purchase Programmes, please see here:<i></i></p><p>For more information on the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, please see here:<i></i></p><p>[1] Eurosystem capital key, which is derived from the ESCB capital key, is used as the basis of allocation for a series of important items including monetary income, banknotes in circulation and the sharing of the ECB&rsquo;s profit/loss among Eurosystem NCBs.

Payment breaks are a significant support for borrowers and provide breathing space to help them address short-term liquidity constraints due to the impact of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  A key focus has been to ensure that regulated entities act in a way that protects the best interests of borrowers and is in line with the relevant codes and regulatory requirements. A well-established and robust consumer protection framework is in place for mortgage customers in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Through ongoing engagement with sector representatives and firms, the Central Bank are working to ensure that affected borrowers are supported through this unprecedented period of stress. To that effect, the Central Bank has published its expectations for payment breaks in credit unions, banks and other firms. These correspondences are available in full on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website. The Central Bank has clearly stated that it is essential that regulated firms take a pro-active and consumer-centric approach to all issues arising from COVID-19, an approach which I fully support. </p>  <p>  Of particular importance is ensuring that customers are provided with sufficient information to understand how the payment break operates, the impact on their loan repayments and cost of credit, and how their case will be treated when the payment break ends. The Central Bank have set out their expectation to industry that at the end of the agreed payment break, customers should be given options to repay the outstanding balance including (i) repaying the loan within the remaining term, or (ii) extending the term of the loan. This choice should apply for all loans, including mortgages, and the impact of the options on the overall cost of credit and monthly repayments should be fully explained to the customer. Customers should also be allowed to make reduced payments during the payment break where they wish to do so. This recognises that the borrower circumstances may differ. It is therefore important that borrowers are presented with the options and information to allow them to make choices which best suit their own circumstances. </p>  <p>  Where borrowers continue to experience financial difficulties at the end of the payment break, supports are available through the existing consumer protection framework, for example, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013. Due regard must be given to the fact that each case of financial difficulty is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. The Central Bank will ensure that lenders are operationally ready and prepared to engage with borrowers during, or at expiry of, the six-month payment break in order to identify whether or not the borrower requires further support, and if so, to consider appropriate and sustainable solutions, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The link to the Guidance can be found here</p><p><i></i></p><p>Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, in March of this year, a special arrangement was put in place to allow civil servants additional time to avail of their annual leave during the 2020/21 annual leave year.</p><p>The Guidance notes that although social distancing and COVID-19 is expected to continue for some time, it is important that employees are still using their annual leave entitlement. Taking a break from work is a chance to recover from the demands of work. Regular breaks from work have been shown to reduce ill health and overall absenteeism. Managers should ensure that their team members are availing of annual leave in a way that supports well-being, and also ensures that their team is supported to take their statutory minimum entitlement. </p><p>The guidance further notes that public service employers should facilitate requests for annual leave where possible so that once the crisis passes, organisations can meet increased demand without having to cater to a large volume of annual leave requests. Section 20 (1) of the Organisation of Working Time Act provides that the times at which annual leave is granted are determined by the employer. In that regard, the employer should have regard to the opportunities for rest and recreation available to the employee but also the need for the employee to reconcile work and any family responsibilities. </p><p>In addition, the guidance notes that if an employee wishes to cancel pre-booked leave (e.g. annual leave) this may be facilitated once it is in line with the normal rules applying in the relevant area of the public sector. Flexibility during this time, from both employers and employees, is advisable. This flexibility should be based on the individual circumstances of each case, with regard to balancing the needs of the business and the employees.</p></reply>

If the construction company is subsequently dissolved the property it held at the time of its dissolution may vest in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the State Property Act, 1954. </p>  <p>  The Minister has limited powers under the Act, but one of those powers is a waiver of his interests in the property. The exercise of this power can only be considered after it has been demonstrated that title to the property was held, at the time of dissolution, by the dissolved company. In addition, Section 28 of the Act states that property held in trust for another does not vest in the Minister.  </p>  <p>  The advice of the CSSO has been requested and the matter will be considered to see what next steps are possible and appropriate.</p></reply>

This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts, which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme.  This will involve, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared by the Commissioners and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to the MPER as part of the formal confirmation process.  </p>  <p>  In order to assist the MPER in making an informed decision to consent to the scheme, the EIA will require appropriate assessment, as required under the 2019 regulations, public consultation for a period of 30 days and a detailed technical review of the scheme by environmental consultants appointed by the MPER.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the current position on the confirmation process is that a request for tender of services for environmental consultants is currently being progressed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). The public consultation phase is also due to be commenced by DPER shortly.   DPER will progress the formal confirmation process, having due regard to the detailed requirements of the 2019 regulations. It is not possible at this point in the process to provide specific dates as requested, given that there is always a possibility that further information/revision of the scheme&rsquo;s design may be required, as provided for under the confirmation process. It should be noted that DPER is also progressing confirmation of two other significant flood defence schemes for the Glashaboy and Bride Rivers in Co. Cork, both of which were submitted prior to the Enniscorthy scheme.</p></reply>

However, as many training providers required some lead in time to make the necessary arrangements the majority of providers will commence offering Safe Pass courses from 15 June. </p>  <p>  Anyone wishing to book a Safe Pass training course should contact their local Safe Pass training provider.

Working in this way broadens the reach of the service to individual children.  It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and the Department of Health and HSE provide a range of services to support those students. These services include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.</p></reply>

This guidance will provide a framework for individual schools, including special schools, to develop plans for the re-opening of school in accordance with their own circumstances and context and the needs of their staff and students.</p><p>A range of support and guidance has been provided for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period.</p><p>I am aware of concerns that the closure of schools has impacted hardest upon families who have children with complex needs whose well-being and engagement with learning depend very much on the routine of school and their relationships with other students, teachers and Special Needs Assistants. They have also lost out on specialist supports during this closure period.</p><p>My Department has taken a number of initiatives to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures. </p><p>These include &ndash;</p><p>- Guidance issued to all schools to support the ongoing learning of children with special educational needs and children who are at risk of disadvantage;</p><p>- Guidance and resources developed by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) on supporting children with special educational needs</p><p>- &euro;10m in ICT grant funding to schools towards the purchase of technology and devices to support students at risk of educational disadvantage.</p><p>- Continued funding of Home Tuition or, where this is not possible, flexibility to bank hours for use at a later time in the year</p><p>- - Resources to support good mental health and well-being amongst students produced by the National  Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) </p><p>- To help schools plan for the new academic year, schools have been informed that their SNA allocation is being frozen at this year&rsquo;s level and there is provision for additionality where this might be required. No school will therefore have a lower allocation for the next school year.</p><p>- The Middletown Centre for Autism has developed a range of online resources for children and young people with Autism and their parents on education provision in the home.</p><p>My Department has published details of a summer programme for children with special educational needs enrolled in special schools, special classes and mainstream classes.  The programme incorporates some aspects of the July Provision of previous years.  </p><p>All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students.  This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate. </p><p>Home-based provision will be available where a child&rsquo;s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year. In this situation my Department will provide grant funding towards the engagement by Parents of a registered teacher / SNA to provide home based support for 10 hours a week for 4 weeks.</p><p>The programme will be reliant on schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) choosing to participate on a voluntary basis.  </p><p>Full information on the scheme and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at Gov.ie/summerprovision</p><p>My Department is working with key stakeholders, and on the basis of public health advice, to develop a framework for the reopening of tertiary education. Tertiary education includes further education and training, and higher education, and is made up of a diverse range of learners, including learners with a disability. The framework will set out high level guidance in relation to how tertiary education</p><p>can reopen for the new academic year for all learners. This framework is due to be published shortly.</p></reply>

Phase 4 of the Roadmap sets out that educational institutions can open on a phased basis at the beginning of the academic year 2020/21 with a limited reopening provided for from Phase 2 on 8th June 2020. This report sets out the risks and impacts on children and society where access to education is significantly reduced. The Department considers that fully reopening schools for children is a clear objective for the end August/September.</p><p>This report is available at: <i> </i></p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at <i></i></p><p>In additional to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. </p><p><i> </i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p><i>https://ncse.ie/online-resources  </i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed.

There are also up to 17,000 Special Needs Assistants available for allocation to schools. There are no proposals at present to review the existing criteria for the allocation of special education supports for schools, or to adjust the current criteria of the allocation of supports, due to matters arising from COVID 19, however, this matter will be kept under review in the context of the re opening of schools.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p><p>Pending the wider re opening of schools, my Department also published on 12th June, 2020, details of a summer programme for children with special educational needs enrolled in special schools, special classes and mainstream classes.  The programme incorporates some aspects of the July Provision of previous years.  </p><p>Summer Provision 2020 &ndash; Reconnecting with Education, is a significantly expanded programme for children with complex special educational needs which aims to re-establish the child&rsquo;s relationships and connection with school and their peers as a basis for learning and participation and to help the child to re-engage in learning and social activities and help them adapt to new routines and changes.  The programme aims to ensure, in so far as possible, that the child can reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  In-school or home-based supports by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with special needs. </p><p>The eligibility criteria has been widened to include the following categories of children:</p><p>- Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism </p><p>- Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties</p><p>- Any child in a special class or special school </p><p>- Children transitioning into a special class from early year&rsquo;s settings</p><p>- Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities: </p><p>- Children with Down syndrome </p><p>- Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing </p><p>- Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment </p><p>- Children who have a moderate general learning disability </p><p>- Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties </p><p>All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students.  This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate. </p><p>Home-based provision will be available where a child&rsquo;s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-16a.486.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1548" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061600010#WRH07000"><p>The vital importance of history, both national history and world history, and the study of history is central to an understanding not just of the past but also of the conditions which created the society in which we live and the many factors which influence the way people live their lives and the attitudes, both positive and negative, which exist in our society. I believe it is important that we continue to teach our future generations the lessons of our history, including the many dark aspects of recent Irish history including our mistreatment of women, children and the Travelling community among others. On this basis I took the decision to give History a &ldquo;special core status&rdquo; in the Junior Cycle from September 2020.</p><p><b></b>The curriculum, at both primary and post primary level, is considered to be for all learners regardless of race, religion, socioeconomic background, gender or orientation. It is the aim of my Department that every child has access to equitable education and that each learner feels safe and happy in the school environment, at every stage. </p><p>At primary level, the current curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community. </p><p>In particular, the Social Personal and Health Education Curriculum (SPHE) supports pupils&rsquo; learning in the areas of inclusion, diversity and counter racism.  In the context of social, economic, cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, it seeks to foster in the child attitudes and behaviour that are characterised by understanding, empathy, and mutual respect. It addresses, too, the issues of equity and human rights, and fosters in the child the realisation that rights have associated responsibilities. Children explore the diversity of the world in which they live. They are encouraged to learn about their own traditions and culture and are given opportunities to compare and contrast these with other ethnic or cultural groups in society. They explore and examine how discrimination can occur in school, in the local community and in their own country. The SPHE curriculum is continued at post primary level and builds on the learning from primary school.</p><p>Intercultural education guidelines were provided by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) in 2007 to support the Primary School Curriculum (1999) and for post-primary schools to identify the ways in which intercultural education permeates the curriculum. These guidelines contribute to the development of Ireland as an intercultural society based on a shared sense that language, culture and ethnic diversity is valuable. They aim to contribute to the development of a shared ability and sense of responsibility to protect for each other the right to be different and to live free from discrimination.</p><p>The Primary Curriculum is currently undergoing a period of review and redevelopment. The draft Primary Curriculum Framework was published by the NCCA in February 2020 on <i> for public consultation</i>. Education and diversity is one of eight overarching principles of the draft framework and provides for equity of opportunity and participation in children&rsquo;s learning. Being an active citizen is one of seven key competencies outlined in the draft framework. This competency fosters within children the knowledge, skills, concepts, attitudes, values and dispositions that motivate and empower them as citizens to take positive actions to live justly, sustainably and with regard for the rights of others. It helps children question, critique and understand what is happening in the world within a framework of human rights, equality and social justice. While the Department prescribes curricula and syllabuses for implementation in primary schools, it does not endorse any textbooks for use in schools. Neither does the Department have any involvement in the publication of such textbooks, beyond informing publishers in a timely fashion about the introduction of any new syllabus.</p><p>At post-primary level, there are a number of prescribed texts for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate. Outside of these prescribed works, the decision on any additional texts to support teaching and learning rests with the school. </p><p>The work of the prescribed text list working groups for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English is informed and guided by Criteria for the Selection of Texts which aims to achieve a balance between classic and contemporary texts; Irish and non-Irish authorship; seeks gender balance in authorship and representation; embraces diversity and inclusion; accessibility of texts; general suitability and comparative potential. </p><p>Current and previous text lists offer many opportunities to explore issues relating to racism and inclusion/exclusion of particular groups in society. The text list for Junior Cycle English currently includes, for example, the novels Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe; Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman; and the play The 14th Tale by Inua Ellams. </p><p>Other texts which offer opportunities to explore issues relating to racism and inclusion/exclusion of particular groups in society include The Secret Diary of Anne Frank; The Cay by Theodore Taylor; Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck; To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee; Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys and the play Girl from the North Country by Conor McPherson. </p><p>At Leaving Certificate level, the text list for English currently includes Americanah by Chimimanda Ngozi Adichie. A number of texts in translation (generally one film and one novel) are also available for study. In the spirit of embracing diversity broadly, currently, the film Mustang by Deniz Gamze Erguven, the memoir If This Is A Man by Primo Levi and the novel Out of Shadows by Jason Wallace are also available for study. </p><p>The plays Eclipsed by Patricia Burke Brogan and Tribes by Nina Raine and the novel The Lauras by Sara Taylor explore the experiences of marginalised groups, namely women in the Magdalene laundries, the deaf community and transgender teenagers. The classic novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley offers significant scope to explore the concept of othering in society and to link it to current examples, such as the black lives matter movement.</p><p>Achieving a balanced list remains a challenging and worthwhile endeavour and work continues to create a broadly balanced, diverse and inclusive list every year.</p></reply>

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the integrated professional induction framework for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.</p>  <p>  Due to Covid-19 and the unprecedented situation of school closures, the Teaching Council has announced revised arrangements which provide additional flexibility to support newly qualified teachers (NQTs) engaging in Droichead in 2019/2020 to complete the process. These arrangements balance the core principles of the policy which is the school based supportive process coupled with engagement in additional professional learning activities.</p>  <p>  The Council has made a significant concession for NQTs who had not completed the full Droichead process within the minimum period of time by 12 March. This includes the recognition of all elements of Droichead which have been completed up to that date i.e. additional professional learning activities, observations, professional conversations, cluster meetings, Taisce (the professional learning portfolio) and days/hours taught. In normal circumstances this would not be the position. </p>  <p>  The Council has also clarified that any time spent engaging in Droichead after 12 March can be included in verification of the Droichead process. This includes remote teaching and learning, professional discussions and online observations. </p>  <p>  Droichead as a process is not simply about teaching time. From a professional standards point of view, it requires the agreement of the NQT and the Professional Support Team in the school that a quality induction process has occurred over the minimum period of time specified. </p>  <p>  While I understand that the Council has communicated with all NQTs and schools affected, further details of the revised arrangements can be found at www.teachingcouncil.ie.</p></reply>

For instance, it would be anticipated that a recently retired teacher, a teacher on approved leave or others who may still be contactable by the school, may be willing to cooperate with this process in whatever way they can in the best interests of the students in these circumstances. However, former teachers cannot be obliged to participate in this process. It is also recognised that there may be cases where there is no access to the previous teacher for a variety of reasons.  In such a case, arrangements should be made for assistance for the new teacher, whether that be from the principal or another experienced teacher in the school.

These working groups members are reviewing immediate operations, medium term contingency planning and the review of specific and acute needs within Tertiary Education as well as the English Language Education sector.  This process continues to facilitate the provision of key information from stakeholders, that will inform immediate and medium term actions to respond to the rapidly changing circumstances.<b></b></p><p>Mitigating the impact for Higher Education Providers and safeguarding that capacity against the backdrop of the broader economic crisis is a priority.  By ensuring that core provision is maintained and in particular by assessing the level of financial vulnerability that may threaten the viability of any specific institution, the Department, the HEA and representative bodies can work together to respond to this crisis.  </p><p>As part of the assessment of the financial impact on the HE sector, significant work has been undertaken by the stakeholder group chaired by the Higher Education Authority in consultation with the IUA and other representative bodies to collect information on the increased costs and projected income losses advised by HEIs arising from the crisis, based on an agreed set of assumptions.  </p><p>In order to mitigate the risk for the viability of individual institutions, my Department is engaging closely with the HEA to provide specific and granular institutional-level detail essential to assess the risk of institutional failure as a means to safeguard future recovery for the sector as a whole.  Following consultation with higher education providers and representative bodies, the HEA has now completed a template of required detail and has submitted this very recently to my Department.  My officials will now consider and analyse the data provided. </p><p>Further Education and Training Institutes are funded from the Exchequer and National Training Fund and do not have private income from sources such as student accommodation, therefore a significant loss of income is not estimated within this sector.</p><p>Furthermore my Department has met with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the potential impact of COVID on the Tertiary Education Sector and the issue has also  been highlighted at Government.  </p><p>The Tertiary Education sector is a key element of the economy&rsquo;s economic and social infrastructure which also has a crucial role in supporting economic and social recovery.  The provision of additional financial support to support Tertiary Education to ensure that it can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs will be examined in the context of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy in the forthcoming period and also in light of the future Programme for Government priorities and commitments. </p><p>Responsibility for national Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) policy and for the primary competitive funding streams for public investment in research in higher education research resides with the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI). I understand that there is continuing positive engagement between all of the key research funding bodies and the representative bodies for the Higher Education sector. Consistent with similar approaches being adopted by the EU and many other international funders, flexibility is being offered in terms of considering proposals to reallocate costs within project awards, the provision of extensions for those directly impacted in terms of access to labs at this time and the possibility to review work packages within individual awards. The research funding bodies have published FAQ documents linked to the specifics of their own programmes, which provide further detail on the flexibility that they will offer to grant holders at this time.  Furthermore, steps being taken under the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business should play an important role in reversing the business disruption experienced in research activities. </p><p>It is difficult to predict the demand for student accommodation for the next academic year, and therefore difficult to predict the loss of income from student accommodation which may be faced by third level institutions. Much depends on unfolding events such as all available national and international public health advice, particularly in respect of the extent to which students will be physically present in their institutions. My Department will continue to monitor the situation closely and any loss of income from student accommodation will form part of the overall financial context in which the provision of additional financial support to the third-level education system will be examined.</p><p>The vast majority of provision in the English language education (ELE) sector is undertaken by private companies and my Department would not have figures available for ELE schools.

The roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions has set out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.</p>  <p>  While my Department will not be issuing guidelines specifically for the re-opening of the English language education sector, guidance to assist the tertiary education sector more generally in planning for reopening is being prepared at present and will be available shortly.  My Department will engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises on this basis. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans, supplemented by any guidance issued by the Department for the tertiary sector.  The protocol envisions close engagement between staff and their employers during the planning, development and implementation of these new workplace measures.  The experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be relevant.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with learner advocates as part of efforts to address student issues in this sector. This engagement will continue and my Department will keep the advocates informed of developments for the planned reopening of this sector.</p></reply>

Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

This experience shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  The legislation was activated for a second time on 29 October 2019 following a report by the NCSE which identified children in South Dublin needing special education school places. Since then, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity amongst schools in the South Dublin area. </p>  <p>  On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p>  <p>  The next steps in the process are being considered, in conjunction with the NCSE, with a view to ensuring that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.</p></reply>

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with teacher representatives where they have outlined their concerns. </p>  <p>  The English language education working group for this sector has been established with a remit to address the issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic with a priority and focus placed in the first instance on issues affecting students as well as other issues arising e.g. how stakeholders can work together to promote the sector as international markets move into recovery. The working group is comprised of key sectoral stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectoral representative bodies of providers and learner advocates.</p>  <p>  The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective in delivering on its remit. While the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership of this working group.  To date, the group has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to identify and help resolve issues as they arise.  The Department and the members of the working group will continue to engage with external parties, to seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP), it is operated and maintained by the Department of Justice and Equality in consultation with my Department. The ILEP is a list of education programmes considered to justify the granting of permission to non-EEA students to live and work in Ireland. English language education providers in Ireland seeking to enrol non-EEA students must be listed on the ILEP and to adhere to its requirements. Enforcement of the ILEP is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  </p>  <p>  In compliance with the Government Decision taken in March 2020, all English language education (ELE) providers closed their premises in accordance with public health advice as part of efforts to combat the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak. As a result, English language education providers have introduced new ways of providing services to their students including facilitating the provision of online classes. This reflects a similar approach that has been adopted by providers across the wider education system. To facilitate this change in provision and on an exceptional basis to enable students to continue their studies while in the State, the Department of Justice and Equality has introduced a range of measures within the ILEP and the wider immigration system to permit the provision of online classes in lieu of in-person tuition. Central to these measures and to govern this new type of provision, all ILEP providers are now required to deliver a minimum of at least 15 student contact hours online per week. This is in addition to a limit placed on the size of these online classes set at a maximum of 15 students per class.</p>  <p>  As the response to the Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the Department of Justice and Equality are keeping these measures under review. This work is informed by engagement with my own Department and with key sectoral stakeholders both bi-laterally and within the forum of the Covid-19 Working Group for the English language education sector.</p></reply>

The programme incorporates some aspects of the July Provision of previous years.</p><p><i>Summer Provision 2020 &ndash; Reconnecting with Education</i>, is a significantly expanded programme for children with complex special educational needs which aims to re-establish the child&rsquo;s relationships and connection with school and their peers as a basis for learning and participation and to help the child to re-engage in learning and social activities and help them adapt to new routines and changes.  The programme aims to ensure, in so far as possible, that the child can reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  In-school or home-based supports by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with special needs.</p><p>The eligibility criteria has been widened to include the following categories of children:</p><p>1. Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism</p><p>2. Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties</p><p>3. Any child in a special class or special school  <b></b></p><p>4. Children transitioning into a special class or special school from early year&rsquo;s settings</p><p>5. Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities: </p> <blockquote> 	- Children with Down syndrome <br /><br />- Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing <br /><br />- Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment <br /><br />- Children who have a moderate general learning disability <br /><br />- Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties  </blockquote>  <p>All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students.  This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate. </p><p>Home-based provision will be available where a child&rsquo;s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year. In this situation my Department will provide grant funding towards the engagement by Parents of a registered teacher / SNA to provide home based support for 10 hours a week for 4 weeks.</p><p>The programme will be reliant on schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) choosing to participate on a voluntary basis.  </p><p>A dedicated online registration system for families of children with special needs to access Summer Provision is now available onGov.ie/summerprovision</p><p>Parents are asked to register their participation online, providing some outline information of the extent of their participation in the programme e.g. number of weeks.</p><p>Once registered, the parent is then free to plan and organise the programme for their child by consulting with the child&rsquo;s school and securing the services of a teacher or SNA. </p><p>I also announced a programme for DEIS schools for this Summer.</p><p>Full information on summer provision and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at Gov.ie/summerprovision</p></reply>

This guidance includes guidance to primary and post-primary schools to support the continuity of teaching and learning, to support those with special educational needs, to support those at risk of educational disadvantage and to support the wellbeing of students. Guidance has also issued to support parents at this time. The latest guidance issued deals with the continuity of schooling in primary schools and separate guidance on Sixth Class Transitions during COVID-19 School Closures. The documents were developed in consultation with the education partners and were informed by Departmental engagement with schools through its Inspectorate and surveys of parents of primary and post-primary students conducted in collaboration with the National Parents&rsquo; Council &ndash; Primary (NPC-P). </p>  <p>  Consultation is ongoing with the management bodies and unions from both sectors on all matters relating to Covid 19,including work now underway to develop guidance and advise on the reopening of schools in the context of the overall Roadmap for reopening society.</p>  <p>  Schools have been very innovative and have adopted various ways to engage with their students to ensure continuity of learning. These methods will vary in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at the home.  Schools are engaging with students and parents using various means such as by post, e-mails, communication apps or the school website. Where technology permits and is the appropriate medium for the student cohort, students may have regular engagement with their teacher/s on platforms such as Google Classroom, Microsoft Office 365 and Edmodo or participate in live meetings through the use of tools such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Webex.  </p>  <p>  Schools have been asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continue to have the opportunity to participate in learning. The age of the children also factors in the methods of engagement used by schools. The aim of these distant learning approaches is to ensure that children stay connected with learning to facilitate progression to the next level of their education.</p>  <p>  Schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on their own context and circumstances. Central to this is the role of the teacher in ensuring that continuity of engagement, regardless of the mechanisms chosen for that purpose and support of school management in addressing issues around engagement and participation of students. My Department will continue to support schools with relevant guidance as required and continue its engagement with the school sector to inform that guidance.</p>  <p>  The recent allocation of additional funding for ICT can be considered in supporting the equality of digital access. The relevant circulars are available at Circular 0031 2020 (ICT Grant) and Circular 0032/2020 (ICT Top-Up Grant). To support the continued use of technology, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) has produced an overview video of the range of resources available on their website.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to review and monitor the situation in accordance with the advice from the HSE and National Public Health Emergency Team.</p></reply>

Additionally for those staff in this sector who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, they are eligible to apply for the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  </p>  <p>  Further to the above, the provider representatives have been advised of the eligibility of businesses in this sector to apply, where appropriate, for further business supports made available by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation via Enterprise Ireland and through its network of Local Enterprise Offices.   </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with provider representatives as we move forwards and prepare for re-opening of the sector. </p></reply>

Central to this is the role of the teacher in ensuring that continuity of engagement, regardless of the mechanisms chosen for that purpose.</p><p>During the school closures teachers were provided with guidance to ensure hat they continued to work and engage with their pupils to ensure the continuity of schooling in the home environment. </p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the current pandemic, has required schools to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils continuity of learning. Assisted by Department funded resources and supports, schools and teachers have demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the new situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  Schools have been asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities or where digital approaches may not be appropriate and to consider this actively in their approaches to provision of remote learning.</p><p>My Department published a series of Continuity of Learning Guidance documents to support continuity in students&rsquo; learning. Those Guidance documents, together with other advice and the details of supports provided by the Department and its support services/agencies are available at <i>www.education.ie/covid19#guidance</i>. Guidance has also issued to parents/guardians of primary school children and is available at this same link in 12 languages. </p><p>This guidance has been developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders &ndash; including teachers, parents and learners. There is also ongoing consultation with the management bodies and unions from both sectors on all matters relating to Covid 19, which is an evolving situation.  The current pandemicwill have implications for the operation of the forthcoming school year and which will likely include blended learning approaches. My Department will be providing further supports and guidance to schools to cater for this evolving situation.</p><p>On a general note and as part of the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 Enhancing Teaching Learning and Assessment, some &euro;160m of funding has issued to date to schools for ICT Infrastructure. This includes &euro;40m recently issuing in the form of a grant payment to all eligible schools and a further &euro;10m top-up funding issued to schools to enable them to specifically support any of their students experiencing difficulty in engaging with remote learning.  In the context of the current public health crisis the funding can be focussed on assisting schools to address ICT needs including the purchases of digital devices, software, essential learning platforms and other ICT solutions as determined by the needs of the individual school.</p></reply>

This ensures a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. This approach is entirely consistent with well-established practice by SUSI and is in accordance with the statutory provisions of the Student Grant Scheme.</p><p>However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant.</p><p>In the assessment of means, a deduction can be made for &ldquo;Holiday Earnings&rdquo; made by the applicant from employment outside of term time but within the reference period, i.e.  2 weeks at Easter, the 12 weeks of summer (June, July and August) and 2 weeks at Christmas. Under the Student Grant Scheme 2020, a deduction of up to &euro;4,500 can be made under this provision.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The programme is also supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Health.  It encourages schools across the country to grow carrots, lettuce, potatoes, strawberries, turnips and herbs. Schools are supplied with grow packs, activity sheets and videos containing everything needed to grow these foods.  Funding provided by my Department for this programme is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Initiative</th>       <th>Amount</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>Incredible Edibles</td>       <td>&euro;5,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>Incredible Edibles</td>       <td>&euro;7,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>Incredible Edibles</td>       <td>&euro;11,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>Incredible Edibles</td>       <td>&euro;11,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>Incredible Edibles</td>       <td>&euro;7,500</td>    </tr> </table> My Department also works closely with the Department of Health and the HSE on the broad Healthy Ireland agenda.  The Department is represented on a number of groups including the National Physical Activity Plan Implementation Group and on the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group.</p><p>Guidance regarding Healthy Lifestyles was issued to post primary schools in 2015 and to primary schools in 2016.  This guidance was drafted in consultation with the Department of Health.  My Department acknowledges the commitment of schools in promoting healthy lifestyle choices for students in a number of ways, including through the curriculum, through schools policy including healthy lunch policies and by the use of resources and programmes chosen by the school.</p><p>Additionally, the School Meals Programme, operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, provides funding towards the provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes:</p><p>- The statutory Urban School Meals Scheme for primary schools is operated by Local Authorities and part-financed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p><p>- The non-statutory School Meals Local Projects Scheme provides funding directly from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to primary schools, post-primary schools and local groups and voluntary organisations which operate their own school meals projects</p><p>The curriculum also informs and educates around healthy eating habits at both primary and post primary levels. </p><p>At primary level, one of the SPHE (Social, Personal and Health Education) strand units 'Taking care of my body' specifically addresses the need for regular exercise and activity as well as the area of nutrition and food and the need for a balanced diet.  This unit is built upon from Infants classes onwards.  By Fifth and Sixth classes children are encouraged to realise and accept responsibility for making wise food choices and for adopting a healthy, balanced diet, and in that, exploring and examining the food pyramid.  Many primary schools operate healthy eating policies with the support of parents.</p><p>Elements of this strand are supported by the &quot;Food Dudes&quot; programme which encourages children to eat more fruit and vegetables both in school and in the home. The programme is managed by Bord Bia and funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries and also by the EU through the School Fruit Scheme.</p><p>At post primary level, the SPHE programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in Junior Cycle.  SPHE for Junior Cycle builds on the primary SPHE curriculum.  Nutrition is specifically addressed in the SPHE curriculum. Students are made aware of the elements of a balanced diet and the importance of healthy eating for physical and mental well-being.  In addition, cross-curricular links with other subjects, such as Home Economics, PE and Science that deal with SPHE-related topics are encouraged. Home Economics as an exam subject also remains a popular choice among students.</p><p>My Department will continue to work in partnership with other Departments and agencies to promote healthy lifestyles for students.</p></reply>

This group is working collaboratively to ensure an appropriate structure for and implementation of relevant and effective measures to mitigate the impact on this valuable economic sector.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has been a world leader in supporting international students who were studying in Ireland when the COVID 19 pandemic arrived on our shores. The level of support for our International Students will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a trusted international partner that looks after students who choose to study here. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage actively with all key stakeholders to ensure the sustainable operation of the tertiary education system is safeguarded in light of its importance in the context of the recovery of the economy overall.</p></reply>

I know this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.  </p><p>As Minister, I have power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. This legislation has been used to good effect in the recent past. This experience  shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community. </p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs.  Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: </p></reply>

Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism </p><p>2. Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties</p><p>3. Any child in a special class or special school  <b></b></p><p>4. Children transitioning into a special class or special school from early year&rsquo;s settings</p><p>5. Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities:</p><p>- Children with Down syndrome </p><p>- Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing </p><p>- Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment </p><p>- Children who have a moderate general learning disability </p><p>- Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties </p><p>All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students.  This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate. </p><p>Home-based provision will be available where a child&rsquo;s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year. In this situation my Department will provide grant funding towards the engagement by Parents of a registered teacher / SNA to provide home based support for 10 hours a week for 4 weeks.</p><p>The programme will be reliant on schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) choosing to participate on a voluntary basis.  </p><p>A dedicated online registration system for families of children with special needs to access Summer Provision is now available on Gov.ie/summerprovision</p><p>Parents are asked to register their participation online, providing some outline information of the extent of their participation in the programme e.g. number of weeks.</p><p>Once registered, the parent is then free to plan and organise the programme for their child by consulting with the child&rsquo;s school and securing the services of a teacher or SNA. </p><p>I also announced a programme for DEIS schools for this Summer.</p><p>Full information on summer provision and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at Gov.ie/summerprovision</p></reply>

Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

As a result, English language education providers have introduced new ways of providing services to their students including facilitating the provision of online classes. This reflects a similar approach that has been adopted by providers across the wider education system. </p>  <p>  To facilitate this change in provision and on an exceptional basis to enable English language students to continue their studies while in the State, the Department of Justice and Equality has introduced a range of measures within the criteria of the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) and the wider immigration system to permit the provision of online classes in lieu of in-person tuition. As part of these measures and to govern this new type of provision, all ILEP listed providers are now required to deliver a minimum of at least 15 student contact hours online per week. This is in addition to a limit placed on the size of these online classes set at a maximum of 15 students per class. Key existing ILEP requirements remain in place including that the academic staff who deliver these classes must be appropriately qualified. These requirements and compliance obligations have been communicated directly to all providers currently listed on the ILEP in addition to be published online.</p>  <p>  The concerns surrounding the standards of online provision have been raised by learner advocates at the Covid-19 Working Group for the English language education sector established by my Department. This working group is comprised of key sectoral stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectoral representative bodies of providers alongside the learner advocates.  At its most recent meeting, the working group was advised of the new ILEP measures adopted by the Department of Justice and Equality as outlined above. In addition, the provider representative bodies in attendance undertook to work together to develop guidelines for their members to address the concerns raised and to improve standards for the delivery of online provision. They further undertook to share these guidelines with learner advocates and the wider working group as they are developed.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans for the introduction of further regulatory measures in relation to the online provision of English language education. The effect of the measures outlined will be kept under review as the response to the Covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve and as this sector moves towards its re-opening. </p></reply>

While on secondment, teachers retain their school post, the terms and conditions that apply to teachers and receive their salary and a secondment allowance which are met in full by my Department.  </p>  <p>  Section 37(6) of the Act makes provision to make regulations relating to a number of matters in Education Centre's such as the appointment of management committees, funding, staffing, provision of information to the Department &amp;amp; other operational matters.</p>  <p>  In September 2017, Regulation 394 for the appointment and secondment of directors of Education Centres was introduced. </p>  <p>  The regulations make provision for an annual Ministerial approval of the secondment of teachers to the role of Director of an Education Centre, subject to a maximum of 5 years on secondment whether those years were as a Director or otherwise. The Regulations provide a legal basis which offers clarity and certainty in the application of public policy and as I'm sure you can appreciate, there is no discretion in their application which would allow for a derogation beyond the 5 year limit set out in the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The timeframes outlined in the Regulations are important and are designed to ensure there is sufficient time for Management Committees to run competitions where necessary, and for school boards of management to release teachers and appoint replacements.  The overall aim is to ensure that new Directors and their replacement teachers are in place in good time for the start of the following school year.</p>  <p>  Regular turnover of seconded teachers is now an established practice with teachers returning to enrich their schools so the investment in their skills is not lost.  Since 2017, 16 Education Centres have successfully recruited new Directors and the work of the Centres has not been negatively affected with each Centre confirming to my Department that the Director has performed satisfactorily.</p></reply>

All decisions taken in relation to re-opening schools are based on public health advice. </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the well-being of schools communities. The response to support the well-being of all within school communities on the return to school requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  This requires a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response will be aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  My Department will work in partnership with the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that the well-being needs of all members of the school community are met.</p></reply>

Phase 4 of the Roadmap sets out that educational institutions can open on a phased basis at the beginning of the academic year 2020/21 with a limited reopening provided for from Phase 2 on 8th June 2020. This report sets out the risks and impacts on children and society where access to education is significantly reduced. The Department considers that fully reopening schools for children is a clear objective for the end August/September.</p><p>This report is available at: <i></i></p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at <i></i></p><p>In additional to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at <i></i><b></b></p><p>Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at<i></i></p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>I also recently announced that a special &euro;10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby &euro;40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. &euro;10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>There are currently over 13,500 additional Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools to provide additional teaching support to pupils. There are also up to 17,000 Special Needs Assistants available for allocation to schools. There are no proposals at present to review the existing criteria for the allocation of special education supports for schools, or to adjust the current criteria of the allocation of supports, due to matters arising from COVID 19, however, this matter will be kept under review in the context of the re opening of schools.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p><p>Pending the wider reopening of schools, my Department also published on 12th June, 2020, details of a summer programme for children with special educational needs enrolled in special schools, special classes and mainstream classes.  The programme incorporates some aspects of the July Provision of previous years.  </p><p>Summer Provision 2020 &ndash; Reconnecting with Education, is a significantly expanded programme for children with complex special educational needs which aims to re-establish the child&rsquo;s relationships and connection with school and their peers as a basis for learning and participation and to help the child to re-engage in learning and social activities and help them adapt to new routines and changes.  The programme aims to ensure, in so far as possible, that the child can reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  In-school or home-based supports by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with special needs. </p><p>The eligibility criteria has been widened to include the following categories of children:</p><p>Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism </p><p>Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties</p><p>Any child in a special class or special school </p><p>Children transitioning into a special class from early year&rsquo;s settings</p><p>Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities: </p><p>Children with Down syndrome </p><p>Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing </p><p>Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment </p><p>Children who have a moderate general learning disability </p><p>Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties </p><p>All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students.  This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate. </p><p>Home-based provision will be available where a child&rsquo;s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year. In this situation my Department will provide grant funding towards the engagement by Parents of a registered teacher / SNA to provide home based support for 10 hours a week for 4 weeks.</p><p>The programme will be reliant on schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) choosing to participate on a voluntary basis.  </p><p>A dedicated online registration system for families of children with special needs to access Summer Provision is now available on<i>Gov.ie/summerprovision</i></p><p>Parents are asked to register their participation online, providing some outline information of the extent of their participation in the programme e.g. number of weeks.</p><p>Once registered, the parent is then free to plan and organise the programme for their child by consulting with the child&rsquo;s school and securing the services of a teacher or SNA. </p><p>Full information on the scheme and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at<i>Gov.ie/summerprovision.</i></p></reply>

During this visit, a number of issues raised in recent correspondence to my Office were investigated. I can confirm that during this visit all rooms were viewed and that no health and safety issues were identified. My officials will be following up with management and residents on any of the issues raised during the recent clinics.</p>  <p>  Concerns had previously been raised with my Office around rodent activity on the premises and water leaking. I am advised that there was no evidence of any rodent activity or water leaking on the day my official visited. When questioned by my official on these matters, the owner confirmed that a resident had reported mice in his room in February. The owner engaged a pest control company who could not find any evidence of rodents. They subsequently monitored the room for three weeks and could not find any evidence of rodents. Regarding the water, I am advised that the owner confirmed that an incident occurred some months ago where water was leaking from a bath/shower on the second floor into a bedroom on the first floor. It was reported to him by the residents in the room and he sought to engage a plumber. One of the residents said he was a plumber and asked if he could fix it. It was addressed within a few hours and no reoccurrence of the leaking has been reported since.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my official identified no concerns about the quality or variety of food available during their visit. Food is prepared onsite by a professional chef and all meat is Halal certified. Residents also have use of the kitchen for special occasions and regularly cook meals of their choice from food supplied by management. Recently arrangements were also made, during Ramadan, for residents to use the kitchen at night.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputies that IPAS officials previously visited the premises unannounced on 13 February last, on foot of concerns raised by a local support group. During the course of this visit, they inspected all bedrooms and recreation rooms and the kitchen and dining facilities and they had lunch with the residents. I am advised that my officials did not find any major issues to report and the residents they spoke to did not raise any issues about the standard of the centre. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) also carried out a visit to the premises in February as part of a programme of visits to a variety of centres over a two week period. No specific issues were brought to my Department's attention regarding the premises arising from their visit. </p>  <p>  Our intention is to accommodate all international protection applicants currently living in emergency accommodation in dedicated accommodation centres as soon as places become available. In the meantime, I hope that this information will provide you with some reassurance on the current situation in the location mentioned. </p></reply>

Any permission which was renewed by an earlier notice of 20 March 2020 and which therefore has a new expiry date between 20 May 2020 and 20 July 2020 is also renewed. </p><p>Provided a person otherwise meets the conditions set out in the notices, this exceptional temporary measure also applies to non-nationals currently outside the State. </p><p>The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions attach. For students, this extension means that they may continue to work if they wish, but they must also re-enrol in an on-line course of study to adhere to the conditions of their permission. </p><p>My Department has engaged with MEI (Marketing English in Ireland), the representative body for the majority of language schools in Ireland. MEI have confirmed that most colleges are now offering on-line courses, and students should contact their college directly to make any necessary arrangements.</p><p>I made a further announcement on 26 May 2020, setting out further measures to assist international students studying English in Ireland who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The new measures are as follows:</p><p>- Students who left the State before completion of their studies due to COVID-19 may return and resume their studies and the duration of their absence will not count towards the two years maximum period of English language study allowed; and</p><p>- International English language students with a current, valid permission who are still in the State and who have completed the maximum two years permitted as a language student, but due to COVID-19 are unable to return home, may remain as students until the end of the year provided they re-enrol in an online course of study for the remainder of the year.</p><p>Visa required students will need to apply for a visa before returning to the State if the validity period of the visa has expired.  While the Immigration Service has temporarily ceased accepting new visa applications, persons legally resident in the State are included in the categories of Priority / Emergency cases, which will continue to be processed.  Visa required students are advised to consult the Immigration Service website for the required documentation - www.inis.gov.ie</p><p>I understand and recognise the difficulties that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on all immigrants, and in particular our international student population. I was, therefore, pleased to be able to announce these new measures to support students, which I hope will provide some welcome assurance and certainty for the coming months. We will continue to keep the situation under active review as matters evolve in our national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>While both the Dublin area Registration Office in Burgh Quay and regional Registration Offices operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain temporarily closed,  arrangements have been put in place for students awaiting first time registration, students who wish to change their permission applications and students who wish to avail of the Third Level Graduate Programme. </p><p>Additionally, my Department is considering alternative arrangements for renewal of registrations and priority will be given initially to those whose Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card has expired.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage all students to regularly consult our updates on the Immigration Service website at: </p><p>A detailed Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document is also available on this website on the impact of COVID-19 on immigration and international protection.

The Group is examining both the reception system for accommodating applicants and the system for processing applications, and is expected to make recommendations for changes in both areas. A briefing paper on the work of the group, prepared by the Chairperson to inform programme for government talks, has been circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  The Briefing Note includes a list of measures, identified so far, which would immediately improve the situation of those currently in Direct Provision, and on which officials of the Department have been asked to prepare proposals for the incoming Government.  The work of the group is advancing at pace and their report is expected by the end of September. </p>  <p>  Minister Flanagan and I are happy that this Briefing Note signals far-reaching proposals and we were anxious to ensure that Dr. Day and her Group were free to make any recommendations they deemed appropriate based on an expert analysis. </p>  <p>  Last year, we also established a high level Interdepartmental Group chaired by a senior official of my Department, to ensure that all Departments are proactively delivering on their responsibilities. The Group is reviewing the management of services for applicants for international protection and considering the short-to-medium term options which could be implemented to improve the system.  Its Report has been finalised and is ready to be submitted to a new Government. </p>  <p>  The system of Direct Provision refers to the suite of State services and supports that are provided by a range of Government Departments and agencies to persons seeking international protection in the State.  It includes provision of medical cards, an exemption from prescription charges, access to education for children, a weekly payment, access to Exceptional Needs Payments, when required, and, of course, ensuring that all basic needs are met, like accommodation and food.  </p>  <p>  It is important note that significant efforts have been made to reform the system in recent years. Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, whose report in 2015 has been the basis for introducing improvements to the system, has himself noted that the system has improved considerably compared to what it was five years ago.</p>  <p>  Significant improvements made to the system in recent years include access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children; the introduction of labour market access; and the continued roll-out of self-catering facilities for residents (now available to more than half of all residents).</p>  <p>In August 2019, Minister Flanagan and I published new National Standards for accommodation centres. These Standards were developed through an Advisory Group including representatives from UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector. The Standards will address a range of themes including accommodation; food and catering; individual, community and family life; health and wellbeing; governance; and meeting the special reception needs of applicants.  These reforms build on the work done in the McMahon Report and meet the requirements of the EU Recast Reception Conditions Directive (Directive 2013/33/EU) which we voluntarily opted into in 2018. It is intended that the Standards will come into force in January 2021 when they will be subject to monitoring and inspection by an appropriate independent body.</p></reply>

This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.</p><p>Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy which facilitated the ratification by Ireland of the Istanbul Convention in 2019.</p><p>A central element of the progress to date has been the landmark Domestic Violence Act 2018, which came into force on 1 January 2019. Through creation of the offence of coercive control, the Act recognised in law the devastating impact that emotional abuse can have on those it is inflicted upon. The Act also improves victim&rsquo;s access to barring orders and provides greater supports for victims in the court process, in areas such as court accompaniment and to be able to give evidence by live television link. Aggravating factors in sentencing are also now provided for.</p><p>Other significant legislative developments in this area include the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which introduced a statutory definition of consent, and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which provides a wide range of measures and services to protect and inform victims during the progress of their case through the criminal justice system.</p><p>A range of other relevant actions and projects are being pursued in this field, for example: </p><p>- my Department has agreed with the Central Statistics Office that it will conduct a major National Sexual Violence Prevalence Study, which will look in detail at the experience of women and men of sexual violence and abuse in Ireland, with repeat large scale surveys every decade, to provide a robust evidence-basis for Government policy; </p><p>- an independent study on domestic homicide and familicide is being carried out;</p><p>-  Working Group review, chaired by Tom O'Malley, BL into the adequacy of measures available to protect vulnerable witnesses during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences is nearing completion; </p><p>- public awareness campaigns have been organised on domestic abuse (&quot;What would you do?&quot; which ran from 2016-2018) and sexual violence (&quot;No Excuses&quot;, which commenced in 2019 and is scheduled to run until 2021)</p><p>- an expanded Victims Charter has been published and is available on the website </p><p>- An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also continuously improving its specialist services and Divisional Protective Services Units are now being rolled out with specially trained officers responsible for investigations, including engagement with victims.  I understand that 16 DPSUs have now been rolled out in 15 Divisions nationwide. </p><p>I would stress that implementation of the Second National Strategy is monitored on an ongoing basis and actions may be added to it by agreement of the Monitoring Committee, which as mentioned is made up of representatives from state agencies and the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to note that my Department is currently leading efforts to identify lessons which can be learned from the inter-agency plan which we put in place to address domestic abuse, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This process includes input from the community and voluntary sector working in this area.  I hope and expect that this will offer the opportunity to further strengthen our national response to the issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy will also be aware that the draft Programme for Government contains a commitment to conduct an audit of statutory responsibilities in this area.  </p></reply>

Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, whose report in 2015 has been the basis for introducing improvements to the system, has himself noted that the system has improved considerably compared to what it was five years ago.</p>  <p>  Significant improvements made to the system in recent years include access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children; agreed National Standards for accommodation providers; the introduction of labour market access; and the continued roll-out of self-catering facilities for residents (now available to more than half of all residents).</p>  <p>  The new National Standards contain specific actions to improve the lives of children in accommodation centres.  As well as the aforementioned access to the services of the Ombudsman for Children,  they are also supported by the Child Protection Policies that we have put in place in the centres.  In addition, there is a Tusla official seconded to my Department to work with our International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS). This ensures that any child protection issues are swiftly followed up and that the process for referrals is as streamlined as possible.</p>  <p>  Currently, around 25% of residents (1,974 people) in the Direct Provision system have own door self-catered accommodation. While, at this time, all available accommodation of this type is fully utilised, families are prioritised when this type of accommodation becomes available.  </p>  <p>  It is to be noted that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in its report on Direct Provision and the International Protection Application Process, published last December, found that there was no clear consensus from the Committee as to what alternatives could or ought to replace the current system. Their Report also acknowledged that any new system of reception and accommodation will need time to ensure the right system is put in place.   </p>  <p>  Finally, Minister Flanagan and I look forward to the completion of the work of Dr. Day&rsquo;s expert group and the implementation of major changes, should the incoming Government accept the proposals.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel across the various Garda Divisions.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>The resources provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2020 of &euro;1.88 billion. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that as at 31 May 2020, there are now 14,700 Garda members nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff and these numbers are continuing to grow.  This figure includes the Garda trainees from two separate intake classes who attested earlier than scheduled in March 2020, which was an operational decision taken by the Garda Commissioner in order to augment An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's capacity to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>A detailed breakdown of Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and this information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Information on the Garda Workforce is available at the following link: </p><p>In relation to  Waterford,  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as at 31 May 2020 there are 378 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Waterford Division.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-16a.921.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061600017#WRR04000"><p>My Department, the HSE and centre management are doing everything that we can to protect the health and welfare of our residents and centre staff as well as that of the wider community at this time. We are working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate.</p><p>All accommodation centres are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website . That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.  </p><p>Shared bedrooms and communal living space are provided in numerous settings. Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. </p><p>The direction from the HSE is that during the COVID crisis non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.</p><p>The established procedure across all centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department currently has dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Dundalk. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. </p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Cahersiveen and Tullamore.  </p><p>We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any of our centres. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.  </p><p>We have cocooned all residents aged 65 or older and those advised to the Department as having a medical illness that requires cocooning. </p><p>We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website . The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. </p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings. </p><p>In centres that operate the Independent living model, there is an onsite food hall were residents can obtain their groceries and toiletries through a cashless system. Approximately half of all residents have access to independent living. For residents in centres that do not yet have independent living, personal hygiene products are issued to residents as part of their toiletries packs and are available as and when required by residents. </p><p>All international protection accommodation centres are contractually obliged to have Wi-Fi available to residents. Televisions are also provided in all bedrooms. This enables children to access educational programmes such as the RTE Home School Hub, which is an additional support for parents and primary school pupils.  Pupils are able to watch, download and engage with curriculum-based content, project work, and fun activities to keep them entertained and learning. This broadcast is a supplement to the ongoing learning being provided by teachers. </p><p>Children who reside in Direct Provision accommodation centres are in the care of their parents and guardians. Similar to all other parents, they are responsible for ensuring that their children are engaging with education at this current time. The Department of Education and Skills (DES) and TUSLA Education Support Service (TESS) are supporting the schools and parents at this time. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS ) of my Department is liaising with these services to ensure that the most vulnerable children are identified and supported.  A communication pathway for schools, parents and centre managers in relation to education issues has been put in place. TESS Education Welfare Officers (EWOs) will identify children and families who may need assistance, liaising with schools and sourcing additional services/resources where necessary.  Children and their parents or guardians living in accommodation centres are also supported by a Tusla official and a Department of Education official seconded to my Department to work with our International Protection Accommodation Service. This ensures that any education or child support issues can be quickly followed up.</p><p>In terms of food and nutrition in centres, over half of all residents now have access to self-catering facilities where people can cook for themselves and their families. Our intention is to have this facility in place across all centres and this process is ongoing. Regional tenders for accommodation now mandate independent living for all new centres procured through that process.</p><p>In the meantime, centres that are catered are contractually obliged to provide a 28 day menu and to consult with residents on that menu. Residents can advise their centre manager of any dietary requirement that they have and this will be facilitated, where possible.  Centres are also contractually obliged to provide culturally appropriate food options for residents and to prepare menus that meet the reasonable dietary needs of the different ethnic groups accommodated at the accommodation centre and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated at the centre. Arrangements can also be made to cater for particular religious dietary needs, for example, Muslim residents observing Ramadan.</p><p>Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements. </p><p>My Department takes any complaints from residents very seriously. Most complaints should be brought to the centre manager in the first instance. If the resident is not satisfied with the outcome, they can make a complaint directly to IPAS, which will be investigated by IPAS officials and acted on appropriately. If the matter is still not resolved to the resident's satisfaction, they can raise a complaint with the Offices of the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children, as appropriate, for their investigation. </p><p>I want to assure you that my Department and I continue to work closely with the HSE and centre management during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.</p></reply>

This was attended by 12 of the 19 residents currently residing at the centre.

During this visit, a number of issues raised in recent correspondence to my Office were investigated.  I can confirm that during this visit all rooms were viewed and that no health and safety issues were identified. My officials will be following up with management and residents on any of the issues raised during the recent clinics. </p>  <p>   Concerns had previously been raised with my Office around rodent activity on the premises and water leaking. I am advised that there was no evidence of any rodent activity or water leaking on the day my official visited. When questioned by my official on these matters, the owner confirmed that a resident had reported mice in his room in February. The owner engaged a pest control company who could not find any evidence of rodents. They subsequently monitored the room for three weeks and could not find any evidence of rodents.

Arrangements were also made during Ramadan recently for residents to use the kitchen at night.</p>  <p>   I can also advise that IPAS officials previously visited the premises unannounced on 13 February last, on foot of concerns raised by a local support group. During the course of this visit, they inspected all bedrooms and recreation rooms and the kitchen and dining facilities and they had lunch with the residents. I am advised that my officials did not find any major issues to report and the residents they spoke to did not raise any issues about the standard of the centre.

I understand that further upgrades are progressing and include the provision of new cells and custody management facilities. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the OPW that property maintenance personnel are currently on site in Sligo working on internal upgrade works at the station, to provide a new custody suite including new cells built to current standards, prisoner processing, interview, solicitor and doctor's rooms.  I understand that the existing cells were not considered suitable for upgrading and the new cells are located in a different section of the building, requiring adjacent prisoner processing facilities.  I understand that these works are currently due to be completed in December 2020.  I am further advised that the OPW is currently preparing a tender package to provide facilities for a scene of crimes unit.</p>  <p>  In general I understand from the Garda authorities and the OPW that further upgrades will ensure that Garda accommodation needs in Sligo are addressed and that the station is upgraded to meet the future operational requirements of Garda members, staff and the public who use it.</p></reply>

The initial period of suspension was until the end of April 2020 but this was further extended to the end of May 2020 and subsequently, for certain sectors, including electronic alarm installers, to the end of July 2020.  I understand that this further suspension will allow contractors to concentrate on returning to work as the public health restrictions which have been in place to deal with the pandemic are eased. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the PSA that the licence and certification cycle do not always coincide and that therefore an audit is not always required when renewing a licence. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the PSA that on 16 March 2020 it advised contractors of revised requirements for renewing licences.  These included the introduction of a new instalment arrangement for licence fees for contractors who were experiencing cash flow difficulties.  Contractors were also informed that certification was not required to renew a licence.  I understand that these measures remain in place.</p></reply>

This funding has as yet not been drawn down by the relevant authority. </p><p>One grant application for a CCTV scheme in Cavan (received in May 2019), was refused by my Department, as it did not meet the statutory requirements for CCTV.  However there is no bar on that applicant reapplying for funding, if and when it meets the statutory requirements for establishment of a CCTV system.</p><p>There are currently no other CCTV grant aid applications on hand in my Department in respect of counties Cavan or Monaghan.</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - - and support and guidance is available through a dedicated email address fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie</p></reply>

The mother can take maternity leave from casual or part-time employment.  She can take up to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, and up to a further 16 weeks of unpaid leave.  Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth.  As Minister of State for Justice and Equality, the legislation that governs the provision of maternity leave is my responsibility and any such amendment would likely require primary legislation.  The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  These matters are currently being examined by Government.</p><p>As you will be aware, on 29 May the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave.  The changes are aimed at individuals who may not have been on the payroll of their employer on 29 February, or been paid in either January or February 2020 and will allow for consistent treatment with other employees.</p><p>The amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process, but in the interim Revenue has agreed to provide a facility to accommodate such cases.  Although expected to be implemented on 12 June, Revenue launched a new process on Monday 8 June which allows employers to include employees returning to employment after a period of paternity, parental or related unpaid leave or were in receipt of Health and Safety Benefit, Parent&rsquo;s Benefit or Illness Benefit paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).  Employers who wish to access the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on behalf of eligible employees covered by these changes can do so by completing a short form available for download via <i>MyEnquiries</i>in Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service (ROS).  The relevant details that employers will need to provide to Revenue include current contractual gross pay, pay frequency, normal PRSI class, type of leave the returning employee availed of and the date of return to work.  Any retrospective subsidy payments due to impacted employees will be processed by Revenue in due course.  This retrospection will apply from 26 March 2020, the date of return to employment or the date the employer was registered for the scheme, whichever is the latest.</p><p>I am conscious of demands on parents at this time and hope that the additional measures to support working parents that I have introduced in recent years, including the new parent&rsquo;s leave scheme and an extension of parental leave, are helping to ease some of these demands.  In addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children.  Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday.</p></reply>

This involves the processing of applications to the Scheme, the payment of the ex-gratia awards to eligible applicants and the transmission of relevant details to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the calculation of pension entitlements and to the HSE for the issue of the Medical Card.  The Unit also makes every effort to assist applicants who make contact seeking referrals to other State services.</p>  <p>  While the Unit maintains a database of all applicants to the scheme, applicants do not typically maintain contact with the Unit once their applications have been processed, nor are they obliged to do so.  For that reason, my Department does not hold current contact details of places of residence for all applicants or indeed where people were resident over the last 20 years.  My Department has not referred any women to the National Advocacy Service (NAS).  I am aware that some women when making their applications to the scheme have availed of the services provided by the NAS to assist with their applications.</p>  <p>  I would note that my Department has no responsibility for the National Advocacy Service, which is funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I similarly have no role in relation to the management or oversight of nursing homes.  However, I have asked my officials to contact the National Advocacy Service over the coming days to determine whether my Department can provide any assistance in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

Work is currently underway on the drafting of Terms of Reference for a Working Group to bring forward a review of entry to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Even in advance of any such review, it is the case that the Public Appointments Service which runs the Garda recruitment campaigns has in recent years made significant efforts to attract candidates from minority communities, including though publication of videos and materials in multiple languages.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in order to promote entry and remove a barrier for entry for individuals from some communities, when launching last year&rsquo;s recruitment competition the Commissioner last year also approved changes to the Garda uniform to allow the wearing of the hijab or turban.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy was adopted last year.  This Strategy reflects a commitment to further diversity in the Garda workforce.  It contains a working definition for the investigation of hate crime, to ensure that Garda&iacute; are alert to and appropriately record hate incidents.  And it commits to proactive, respectful engagement with all members of society, including minority groups.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a number of actions have already taken under the Strategy.  These include:</p>  <p> - organisation of the annual Consultation Day in December 2019, which involved representation from a wide spectrum of our diverse and minority communities;</p>  <p> - organisation during 2020 of dialogue days, tailored to specific minority groups and including discussion of barriers to entry.  Further dialogue days  were postponed, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but will be rescheduled when circumstances allow. And </p>  <p> - establishment of a Diversity Forum.  The terms of reference of the Diversity Forum will include addressing the barriers to recruitment and retention as well as monitoring progress in this field.  Representatives for the Forum have been identified but progress has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

These are temporary measures and, as the country reopens, the Courts Service are reviewing their operations to maximise the resources available to them, while following Government guidelines to ensure that court business is conducted in a safe environment.  The future use of Drogheda courthouse is part of the review.   </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has built a significant video-link infrastructure over the last decade but it was not installed in every courthouse for budgetary reasons and because the projected usage did not justify the investment.  When Drogheda courthouse was built, the building was future proofed by being wired to facilitate video-link.  However, the technology was not installed as Dundalk courthouse already had the facility and resources were needed in other parts of the country.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, video-link usage has seen significant growth and the Courts Service expect this to grow further in the coming years.  A business case is presently being prepared to install video-link facilities in courthouses that are considered suitable and that presently do not have them.  Drogheda has been identified as one such courthouse.  This does not guarantee the installation of the technology as the business case will be assessed and approved on its merits but it is an objective of the Courts Service to maximise the use of technology where it is sensible to do so.</p></reply>

The Policy was issued on 23 November 2019.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that, sadly, four deaths have been notified to IPAS since the introduction of its Critical Incident Policy in November 2019.  One death occurred in 2019 and a further three have occurred in 2020.</p>  <p>  Where a person dies while they are being provided with accommodation by my Department, we work closely with the centre manager to assist the person&rsquo;s next of kin, if known, in accessing the supports provided by the State, and to ensure that any other residents affected by the death are assisted in accessing services that can support them.</p>  <p>  All records of deaths in Ireland are held in the General Register Office, which is the central civil repository for records relating to Births, Marriages and Deaths in Ireland and my Department does not have an official role in the collation of statistics on deaths of International Protection applicants.  In particular, it should be noted that the IPAS, and the Reception and Integration Agency before it, may have not always be informed of a death, for example if the death occurs in a hospital or other setting.</p>  <p>  All deaths and serious incidents that occur within accommodation centres provided by my Department are referred to the Garda&iacute; as a matter of course and the Garda&iacute; in turn refer all deaths to the local Coroner&rsquo;s office.  As is the case with all Garda&iacute;/Coroner matters, IPAS is not privy to information pertaining to individual investigations carried out under their remit.  IPAS provides information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Coroner&rsquo;s Office as and when requested.</p></reply>

This involves the processing of applications to the Scheme, the payment of the ex-gratia awards to eligible applicants and the transmission of relevant details to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the calculation of pension entitlements and to the HSE for the issue  of the Medical Card.  The Unit also makes every effort to assist applicants who make contact seeking referrals to other State services.</p>  <p>  While the Unit maintains a database of all applicants to the scheme, applicants do not typically maintain contact with the Unit once their applications have been processed, nor are they obliged to do so.  For that reason, my Department does not hold current contact details of places of residence for all applicants.  Having reviewed the records of the Unit, I can confirm that there were there are no applicants recorded as being resident at this nursing home. </p>  <p>  I would note that my Department has no responsibility for the National Advocacy Service, which is funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I similarly have no role in relation to the management or oversight of nursing homes.  However, I have asked my officials to contact the National Advocacy Service over the coming days to determine whether my Department can provide any assistance in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

This includes people who are resident in Direct Provision centres, in emergency accommodation in hotels and guesthouses and in the Balseskin Reception Centre. </p><p>It should be borne in mind that a number of residents voluntarily opted to move out of their accommodation on a temporary basis during the onset of COVID-19.  It was agreed that residents could choose at this time to live outside the centre with family or friends and my Department has confirmed that they will be able to return to their centre after following Public Health advice, when the crisis ends.</p><p>The table below shows the number of persons residing in accommodation as of 7 June 2020, by nationality.  At that date, there were people from a total of 103 different nationalities residing in our accommodation.  The figures include both international protection applicants and 916 people who are no longer in the process, having already been granted an international protection status (refugee status or subsidiary protection) or a permission to remain in the State.  We are assisting these residents to transition to permanent mainstream accommodation, working closely with the City and County Managers Association, the Local Authorities and organisations like Depaul Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust and the Jesuit Refugee Service.  People with status or permission to remain in the State have the same entitlement to housing supports and State services as everyone else.</p><p>No breakdown is provided for nationalities with less than 10 people due to the increased risk of their identification, which is prohibited under Section 26 of the International Protection Act 2015. <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Nationality  </b></th>

It is a matter for the health authorities to comment on the numbers of deaths related to the virus and the settings in which such deaths have occurred.  On 26 May 2020, at a session of the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, HSE officials confirmed that there were no admissions to intensive care nor any deaths of either residents or staff at any of our accommodation centres.  I can also confirm that my Department has not been notified of any COVID-19-related death of a resident by the HSE since that date.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware of the general policy that applies when a person dies while they are being provided with accommodation by my Department&rsquo;s International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS).  Department officials work closely with the centre manager to assist the person&rsquo;s next of kin, if known, in accessing the supports provided by the State, and to ensure that any residents affected by the death are assisted in accessing services that can support them.</p>  <p>  All deaths and serious incidents that occur within accommodation centres provided by my Department are referred to the Garda&iacute; as a matter of course and the Garda&iacute; in turn refer all deaths to the local Coroner&rsquo;s office.  It is primarily a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to notify the next of kin of the death of a person if required.  As is the case with all Garda&iacute;/Coroner matters, IPAS is not privy to information pertaining to individual investigations carried out under their remit.  IPAS provides information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Coroner&rsquo;s Office as and when requested.</p>  <p>  The IPAS has developed a critical incident policy.  The policy includes guidelines for IPAS Staff and accommodation centre managers and staff in the event of the death of a resident.  The policy includes a protocol for record keeping whereby IPAS will maintain a record of all critical incidents.  The policy was issued on 23 November 2019.</p></reply>

Further detail in that regard can be obtained from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>Although primary responsibility for funding frontline services, including refuges for victims of domestic abuse, rests with Tusla, I can reassure the Deputy that combatting domestic abuse is also a priority for me and my Department.  It is also an important aspect of the National Strategy for Women and Girls and the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.</p><p>At an early stage in the Covid-19 pandemic and in recognition of the added risk of domestic abuse which some people face in that context, my Department developed an inter-agency plan to address domestic abuse during this pandemic.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too confirmed that it continued to attach the highest priority to domestic abuse incidents during the pandemic, including through &lsquo;Operation Faoiseamh&rsquo;, a proactive initiative designed to ensure victims of domestic abuse are supported and protected throughout the period.</p><p>As part of this inter-agency plan and in addition to the funding already allocated for 2020, my Department has to date provided an additional &euro;285,000 to organisations in the sector, to support and extend the existing services they offer during the period of the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p>The additional funding provided to date in this way consists of the following: </p><p>- Women&rsquo;s Aid: &euro;63,000 for additional resources to extend the Support and Referral Service and the High Risk Support project;</p><p>- Rape Crisis Centre Network Ireland: &euro;50,000 to support the work of local centres and to manage information on advice and guidance for frontline trauma support workers;</p><p>- Ruhama: &euro;14,000 for additional support packs for women seeking to exit prostitution;</p><p>- Men&rsquo;s Development Network: up to &euro;39,340 for an extension of the Male Advice line and extra telephone support for the Men Ending Domestic Violence programme;</p><p>- Safe Ireland: &euro;36,000 for additional personnel capacity and communicating with their service users;</p><p>- Move Ireland: &euro;33,000 for additional helpline and counselling support for perpetrators; </p><p>- Rape Crisis Centre Forum: &euro;50,000 for local awareness-raising campaigns and for development of a package of revised service processes, standards and procedures, including adaptations to new ways of working arising from pandemic.</p><p>Other actions under the plan aimed at ensuring that domestic abuse and sexual violence continue to receive the highest priority from the civil and criminal justice system.  This includes priority by the Legal Aid Board and Courts Service for domestic abuse cases, and availability of a Legal Aid Board helpline to ensure that persons experiencing domestic violence issues get prompt legal advice and legal representation in court where needed. </p><p>Tusla has also put a range of practical supports in place including funding, identification of additional accommodation capacity, and provision of additional ICT resources. </p><p>Deputies will also have noted that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has recently announced her decision to make rent supplement available on a short-term basis to victims of domestic abuse, referred via Tusla-funded domestic abuse service providers.  Minister Doherty has indicated that these arrangements will be reviewed after six months of operation.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that my Department is also leading a public awareness campaign on domestic abuse during the Covid-19 crisis, in partnership with frontline services in the community and voluntary sector.  Further information on the organisations involved in this initiative as well as services and supports for victims is available on the website </p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, recruitment to the health service is solely a matter for the HSE. </p>  <p>  However, I can say that there are approximately 160 persons living in our accommodation centres who have identified as healthcare workers.</p>  <p>  Any healthcare workers living in our accommodation were eligible to apply for accommodation under the HSE&rsquo;s Temporary Accommodation Scheme announced on 10 April 2020.  The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department has been actively encouraging all healthcare workers living in accommodation centres to apply for this temporary accommodation for their protection and that of other centre residents and staff. We have provided information, forms and guidance and have also asked the NGO community to support this initiative and to help to bring it to the attention of residents through their support networks. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there was a relatively low take-up of the accommodation offers by the health care workers in our accommodation centres. According to the HSE, between 10% and 20% indicated a willingness to accept such an offer. There are many reasons for this, including that some have family in the direct provision centre and do not wish to leave them or the services and supports available in their centre may be greater than what is on offer through the temporary accommodation scheme. We are aware of some cases where the employer has provided accommodation on a temporary basis. </p>  <p>  Some residents have chosen to live outside the centre with family or friends and we have confirmed that they will be able to return to their centre when the crisis ends. In addition, as you will appreciate, residents who are working are not wholly dependent on the State and they may choose to source and provide for their own accommodation, at any time, as other workers do.  </p>  <p>  Any essential workers who continue to reside in our centres at this time are expected to follow the same rules as all residents on adhering to social and physical distancing, good hand and respiratory hygiene and self-isolation measures, as required, for their safety and that of other residents and staff.</p></reply>

This was attended by 12 of the 19 residents currently residing at the centre. </p>  <p>  The clinic was held off-site in the Miltown Malbay Community Centre and was facilitated by a volunteer from the Limerick and Clare Educational Training Board (LCETB). Other than the residents and the facilitator, only the manager of the Community Centre and the caretaker were present onsite at the time.</p>  <p>  Each resident attended their own clinic appointment in a separate room away from the facilitator and the manager of the Community Centre to ensure privacy and confidentiality.</p>  <p>  The majority of residents who attended the clinic stated they were happy with the food and with the accommodation in general. A small number of the residents who participated in the clinics stated that the food was not to their liking. </p>  <p>  Following the clinics, an unannounced visit was made to the accommodation the next day (5 June 2020) by a senior official from my Department. During this visit, a number of issues raised in recent correspondence to my Office were investigated.  I can confirm that during this visit all rooms were viewed and that no health and safety issues were identified. My officials will be following up with management and residents on any of the issues raised during the recent clinics.</p>  <p>  IPAS officials previously visited the premises unannounced on 13 February last, on foot of concerns raised by a local support group. During the course of this visit, they inspected all bedrooms and recreation rooms and the kitchen and dining facilities and they had lunch with the residents. I am advised that my officials did not find any major issues to report and the residents they spoke to did not raise any issues about the standard of the centre. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) also carried out a visit to the premises in February as part of a programme of visits to a variety of centres over a two week period. No specific issues were brought to my Department's attention regarding the premises arising from their visit.</p>  <p>  It is my Department&rsquo;s intention is to accommodate all international protection applicants currently living in emergency accommodation in dedicated accommodation centres as soon as places become available. In the meantime, I hope that this information will provide you with some reassurance on the current situation at this centre.</p></reply>

These characteristics are race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community and sexual orientation.</p><p>I understand that there have been in the region of 50 prosecutions since the enactment of the 1989 Act. </p><p>Other than in relation to incitement and again as the Deputy will appreciate, a hate motive is an aggravating factor that judges can take into account (on a non-statutory basis) at sentencing for any criminal offence. </p><p>I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reported, at a national level, on hate-based motivations for crime incidents in previous annual reports.  The figures furnished in those annual reports for crime incidents with hate motivations during the last 5 years are as follows: </p><p>2015: 164</p><p>2016: 290 </p><p>2017: 324</p><p>2018: 340 </p><p>2019: 250</p><p>2020 (to date, up to 15 June): 90 </p><p>I am informed that hate-related motivations have historically not been recorded for incidents that do not meet the threshold of criminality (i.e. non-crime incidents).</p><p>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully accepts that there is under-recording of hate motivated crimes.  However significant actions are underway to improve internal recording of hate related incidents and also to encourage more reporting by the public.  In particular, the Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy has a significant focus on enhancing the identification, reporting, investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. </p><p>This includes the introduction in that Strategy of a working definition by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to their investigation and recording of hate crimes,  to the effect that a hate crime is &ldquo;any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person to, in whole or in part, be motivated by hostility or prejudice, based on actual or perceived age, disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or gender.&rdquo; </p><p>Finally, as part of the Diversity and Integration Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is upgrading PULSE to capture hate related motivations for all incidents, both crime and non-crime. I am confident that this will enable more accurate collation of data in relation to these crimes and incidents in the future.</p></reply>

Furthermore, rules and procedures for the taking of affidavits are set out in Order 40 Rule 5 of the Superior Courts Rules, Order 25 Rule 1 of the Circuit Court Rules and Order 50 Rule 2 of the District Court Rules.  Legislative changes would be required before changes in those procedures and rules could be brought about and only following careful consideration.</p>  <p>  The Government approved drafting of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 in January last.

The Health and Safety Authority, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Department of Health, and the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation have published extensive information on working safely during the current health emergency.  The Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation have also established a helpline to support and advise businesses in adapting to the current challenges.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate that these are difficult times for everyone and I would like to acknowledge the commitment, flexibility and innovation demonstrated by all involved in safely delivering continuity of access to justice during the current public health emergency.</p></reply>

During this visit, they interacted with centre staff and residents and listened to any comments or issues brought to their attention.

This team undertakes daily calls with all centre managers across our network of permanent and temporary centres. Feedback from these conversations is reflected in the newsletters circulated to all centre managers to promote shared learning and best practice, which are available to view on our website .

It should be noted that targeted enforcement measures have been introduced in a number of areas where quad bikes and scramblers were causing difficulties. For example, Garda&iacute; in areas like Finglas have had recent success in reducing the number of issues with scramblers through targeted enforcement, while youth community engagement groups in Limerick have had successes diverting young people away from using these vehicles in a dangerous manner in public places, and towards properly organised motorcross events. </p><p>As I have outlined in previous Parliamentary responses, a cross-agency group has been examining the misuse of scramblers. This process has involved my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities.</p><p>On foot of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it was agreed that, in the main, current legislative provisions appeared to be sufficient. Nonetheless it was also agreed that the group would remain open to considering workable legislative solutions to any specific legislative gaps specifically identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>My officials wrote to the Garda Commissioner to seek his formal views on the matter. The response from the Office of the Garda Commissioner does suggest potential legislative changes which the organisation believes could assist in improving policing in this area.  </p><p>The cross-agency group most recently met in December 2019. The group agreed that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport &ndash; which has primary responsibility for road traffic legislation &ndash; would explore the feasibility of developing new legislative provisions in road traffic legislation, following on from the suggestions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without unintended consequences for existing law.  </p><p>It was also agreed that my Department would consider and develop actions in order to increase awareness of the dangers of these vehicles jointly with affected communities, community groups and other stakeholders, and explore how best to engage with young persons who are drawn to this behaviour. My Department is  examining options in this area, with due regard to social distancing requirements. </p><p>More broadly, the Deputy may also wish to be aware that the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026 has recently been published for public consultation by my colleague, the Minister for State David Stanton.  An online questionnaire is available until the end of June to allow members of the public, including of course young people, to express their views.  Further information is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p></reply>

Targeting all migrants legally in the State, its 76 actions are delivered by government departments, local authorities, local communities, the business sector, sporting and arts organisations and NGOs across a number of policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including employment, education and social inclusion.

The Migrant Integration Strategy commits public bodies to take action on employment, education, access to public services, political participation and immigration. It requires all public bodies to mainstream integration issues into their work. It includes specific actions to tackle racism, from requiring local authorities to remove racist graffiti to ensuring there is migrant representation on Joint Policing Committees. </p>  <p>  I chair the Strategy Committee, which includes representatives of NGOs and public bodies, and it meets quarterly to monitor implementation of the Strategy and to press for delivery of specific actions. A key theme of the Strategy involves actors from all sectors and the wider community, in &ldquo;Promoting Intercultural Awareness and Combating Racism and Xenophobia&rdquo; {Theme 9, Actions 61-71 of the Strategy}</p>  <p>  Actions within the Migrant Integration Strategy concentrating specifically on tackling racism and hate crime are:</p>  <p>1. A review of current hate crime legislation with a view to strengthening it, particularly in the area of hate-speech;</p>  <p>2. Tackling the issue of under-reporting of racially motivated crime;</p>  <p>3. Tasking all public sector bodies that engage with local communities to explore ways of bringing minority and host communities closer together; and</p>  <p>4. Ensuring that local authorities play their role through development of local integration strategies, ensuring early removal of racist graffiti, and encouraging migrant groups to participate in Joint Policing Committees.</p>  <p>  Actions applicable to all Government Departments under the Strategy include the provision of information to migrants in language-appropriate formats, ongoing intercultural awareness training for all front-line staff, signage in public offices indicating where interpretation is available and clear information on how to make a complaint about racist behaviour by staff or another customer.</p>  <p>  Anti-Racism Initiatives are also supported under various Government funding programmes which are implemented by Agencies and community and voluntary sector organisations . Examples include Fingal County Council&rsquo;s project Promoting Integration and Social Cohesion and Sport Against Racism Ireland, all of which deliver anti-racism programmes for young people with the support of funding from the Department.</p>  <p>  Some progress has been made under Action 67 of the Migrant Integration Strategy which requires all public offices will display information on how to make a complaint of racist behaviour by a member of staff or another customer. The Migrant Integration Strategy Progress Report 2019, shows that in the cross-cutting actions survey results, of the 22 Departments/Agencies with Public Offices, four (18%) reported displaying information on how to make a complaint specifically about racist behaviour (the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Bus &Eacute;ireann, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners). My Department will continue to monitor progress on this action through surveying responsible bodies prior to meetings of the monitoring committee.</p>  <p>  My Department will shortly be requesting an update of this and other actions from Government Departments and Agencies in preparation for the next meeting of the Migrant Integration Strategy Monitoring and Coordination Committee, which has unfortunately been delayed due to the holding of the General Election in February and the COVID-19 pandemic. All Departments and Agencies will be reminded of their responsibilities under these actions at the next meeting.</p>  <p>  The overall mission of my Department is to work to deliver a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland.  My Department is also working as a priority to develop new legislation to deal with both hate speech and hate crime. New legislation to introduce specific hate crime legislation and to strengthen the law on incitement to hatred is being progressed. Last October, Minister Flanagan and I launched a public consultation to ensure legislative proposals responded to the real life experience of victims and to seek views. There has been consultations with civil society groups, experts, professional organisations, community groups and members of the public and any new legislation will be informed by the outcomes for these consultations.</p>  <p>  The promotion of diversity, integration and inclusion is a vital challenge which faces all modern societies in a time of globalisation. We are committed to developing and nurturing an all-inclusive society in Ireland. Racism and xenophobia are the very antithesis of the equality, integration and inclusion that we are working to support in communities across Ireland. Both Minister Flanagan and I have made clear that all forms of prejudice and intolerance are completely unacceptable. We and the Government as a whole are fully committed to ensuring that Ireland is a safe and secure place for all and that appropriate tools are in place to address prejudice in all forms.</p>  <p>  Minister Flanagan and I announced the formation of a new Anti-Racism Committee in June 2019. Professor Caroline Fennell, UCC Professor of Law and Commissioner with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has been appointed chairperson of the committee. The Committee has a mandate to review current evidence and practice and make recommendations to Government on how best to strengthen its approach to tackling racism.  It will seek to develop an understanding of the nature and prevalence of racism in Ireland and to work towards achieving a social consensus on actions required, by State and non-State actors.  In performing its role, the Committee will engage with stakeholders from a range of sectors.</p></reply>

The Group is examining both the reception system for accommodating applicants and the system for processing applications, and is expected to make recommendations for changes in both areas. A briefing paper on the work of the group, prepared by the Chairperson to inform programme for government talks, has been circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  The Briefing Note includes a list of measures, identified so far, which would immediately improve the situation of those currently in Direct Provision, and on which officials of the Department have been asked to prepare proposals for the incoming Government.  The work of the group is advancing at pace and their report is expected by the end of September. </p>  <p>  Minister Flanagan and I are happy that this Briefing Note signals far-reaching proposals and we were anxious to ensure that Dr. Day and her Group were free to make any recommendations they deemed appropriate based on an expert analysis. </p>  <p>  Last year we also established a high level Interdepartmental Group chaired by a senior official of my Department,  to ensure that all Departments are proactively delivering on their responsibilities. The Group is reviewing the management of services for applicants for international protection and considering the short-to-medium term options which could be implemented to improve the system.  Its Report has been finalised and is ready to be submitted to a new Government. </p>  <p>  The system of Direct Provision refers to the suite of State services and supports that are provided by a range of Government Departments and agencies to persons seeking international protection in the State.  It includes provision of medical cards, an exemption from prescription charges, access to education for children, a weekly payment, access to Exceptional Needs Payments, when required, and, of course, ensuring that all basic needs are met, like accommodation and food.  </p>  <p>  It is important note that significant efforts have been made to reform the system in recent years. Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, whose report in 2015 has been the basis for introducing improvements to the system, has himself noted that the system has improved considerably compared to what it was five years ago.</p>  <p>  Significant improvements made to the system in recent years include access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children; agreed National Standards for accommodation providers; the introduction of labour market access; and the continued roll-out of self-catering facilities for residents (now available to more than half of all residents).</p>  <p>  The new National Standards contain specific actions to improve the lives of children in accommodation centres.  As well as the aforementioned access to the services of the Ombudsman for Children,  they are also supported by the Child Protection Policies that we have put in place in the centres.  In addition, there is a Tusla official seconded to my Department to work with our International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS). This ensures that any child protection issues are swiftly followed up and that the process for referrals is as streamlined as possible.</p>  <p>  Currently, around 25% of residents (1,974 people) in the Direct Provision system have own door self-catered accommodation. While, at this time, all available accommodation of this type is fully utilised, families are prioritised when this type of accommodation becomes available.  </p>  <p>  It is to be noted that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in its report on Direct Provision and the International Protection Application Process, published last December, found that there was no clear consensus from the Committee as to what alternatives could or ought to replace the current system. Their Report also acknowledged that any new system of reception and accommodation will need time to ensure the right system is put in place.   </p>  <p>  Finally, Minister Flanagan and I look forward to the completion of the work of Dr. Day&rsquo;s expert group and the implementation of major changes, should the incoming Government accept the proposals.</p></reply>

The Policy provides that once notified of a death, IPAS will record the incident. The Critical Incident Policy also sets out the guidelines for centre managers on what to do should a death occur in their premises.  However, it should be noted that it is the Office of the Coroner who makes the official record of deaths. The IPAS record is only of deaths notified and it is not an official record because this function is held by the General Register Office, which is the central civil repository for records relating to Births, Marriages and Deaths in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Sadly, four deaths (all of whom were adults) have been notified to the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department since the introduction of its Critical Incident Policy in November 2019. </p>  <p>  Where a person dies while they are being provided with accommodation by the Department&rsquo;s International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS), we work closely with the centre manager to assist the person&rsquo;s next of kin, if known, in accessing the supports provided by the State, and to ensure that any residents affected by the death are assisted in accessing services that can support them.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-16a.1098.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020061600020#WRU00400"><p>A key recommendation underpinning the Justice McMahon Report on improvements to the International Protection process was to address the length of time taken to process applications, which can lead to long stays in State provided accommodation.  </p><p>With the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016, we now have a single application procedure. This is the biggest reform to our protection process in two decades.  It means that an applicant has all aspects of their claim (refugee status, subsidiary protection status, and permission to remain), examined and determined in one process. The aim is to provide first instance decisions in the shortest possible timeframe.  </p><p>The International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department is responsible for examining all applications received. The staff of the IPO (the Chief International Protection Officer and the International Protection Officers) are independent by law in the exercise of their international protection functions. </p><p>Upon the commencement of the 2015 Act, approximately 3,500 legacy cases were carried over to be dealt with under the new single application procedure (1,500 of these cases were from the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and 2,000 from the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal).  A further 500 cases transitioned in the months following commencement.  These cases would have been the longest in the system at the commencement of the Act.  </p><p>The International Protection Office (IPO) committed to scheduling these legacy cases for interview by the end of 2018 and for completion by the end of Q2 2019, where possible.</p><p>The IPO achieved the first part of this commitment in 2018 by scheduling all transition cases for interview, where it was possible to do so. The vast majority of the legacy cases have now been processed to completion in the IPO, and the focus is now on post commencement single procedure cases.  </p><p>Some legacy cases will continue to be dealt with.  These include transition applicants who had not co-operated up to this point but who are now re-engaging with the process and applicants who have come back into the process through Judicial Review.  These cases are prioritised and scheduled for interview at the earliest possible opportunity and are processed accordingly.</p><p>Cases processed in Q1 2020, where applications were made after the introduction of the International Protection Act 2015 (full Single Procedure cases), had a median processing time of 14.7 Months (9.7 months for priority cases) from date of application.  Including the cases that came before the International Protection Act, the overall waiting time is 14.9 Months. Prioritised applications include those from especially vulnerable groups of applicants, such as unaccompanied minors and applicants from refugee generating countries like Syria and Eritrea.</p><p>However, it should be noted that at the end of February 2020, prior to the Covid-19 global pandemic, an applicant who applied for international protection at that time could have expected to receive a first instance recommendation/decision within approximately 11-12 months, with prioritised applications being processed within 8-9 months provided that no complications arose and that application figures did not rise further.  </p><p>The IPO is working hard to try to achieve a target of 9 months in the vast majority of cases.  However it must be acknowledged that the processing of applications is complex and that each application deserves and receives an individual assessment.</p><p>Covid-19 social distancing restrictions have impacted on the number of applications being assessed by the International Protection Office.<b></b>Substantive interviews of international protection applicants have been suspended until further notice. The IPO hopes to resume interviewing shortly and is exploring options to do so in a manner which is consistent with public health advice during Covid-19. The IPO will issue notification when interviews resume. All IPO case processing teams are continuing to work remotely on processing cases during this period. </p><p>The International Protection Office (IPO) has remained open for the taking of applications for international protection and has continued working on international protection applications where interviews took place before the implementation of measures to restrict the spread of Covid-19.  </p><p>The IPO has begun issuing some first instance recommendation letters to applicants in cases where their interview has previously taken place and a recommendation to grant refugee status has been made.</p><p>The Immigration Service Delivery function of my Department is continuing to process cases to the extent allowed by government restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19 and that means that as much of the work that can be done remotely is up to date. However, the timelines for the actual issuing of the decisions have necessarily been pushed out to enable conformity with public health measures on social distancing and non-essential travel. We can, however, look at emergency cases on an individual basis and take a tailored approach to them.</p><p>Waiting times for decisions on international protection applications are not routinely published by my Department. </p></reply>

I appreciate that the Deputy continues to seek answers with regard to bringing the perpetrators to justice. It is the sincere wish of us all that this would happen. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the matter was thoroughly investigated at the time by An Garda S&iacute;ochana, with assistance from the Defence Forces and the close cooperation of the authorities in Northern Ireland. Despite their best efforts however, it was not possible to secure the evidence which would have led to the prosecution of the perpetrators. This continues to remain a source of disappointment and frustration. </p>  <p>  As I have also informed the Deputy previously, the passage of almost fifty years at this stage, and with no new evidence forthcoming, has diminished the prospect of securing a successful prosecution. However, I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the case remains open and that they will investigate any new information. They also remain committed to working closely with the PSNI as necessary, where that could advance the investigation. </p>  <p>  I would repeat my appeal that anyone with any information in relation to this heinous act should bring it to the attention of the Garda authorities. </p></reply>

As a result of these restrictions, the Immigration Service Delivery, along with many other public and private sector organisations is experiencing significant disruption in delivering its core functions. </p><p>Working within these restrictions, public safety and the wellbeing of staff are of course both urgent priorities. However I can assure the Deputy that the matter is receiving ongoing attention and as soon as a practical plan is in place for the re-commencement of normal service delivery, notifications will be placed on our website (<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>). </p><p>On 13 May 2020, I announced that immigration permissions, due to expire between 20 May 2020 and 20 July 2020, would be automatically extended for two months.  </p><p>This includes people in Ireland on short stay visas and those whose permissions have already been extended by the previous notice, which extended permissions between 20 March 2020 and 20 May 2020. The renewal of the permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions are attached regarding the access to state services.  As a result of this automatic renewal of permissions , the requirement to present at an Immigration registration office to register or renew a permission is also temporarily suspended. </p><p>In relation to persons with existing permission under Directive 2004/38/EC (Free Movement Directive), the automatic renewal is subject to the requirement that the person is complying with the requirements of the Directive.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage the Deputy to view our updates and a detailed Frequently Asked Questions document on the Immigration Service website at:<i></i>.</p></reply>

These actions were incorporated into the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, which was launched the following year.</p><p>I agree with the Deputy about the importance of this subject and my Department coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which is a whole-of-Government approach addressing the many actions necessary to address these matters fully.</p><p>The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.</p><p>Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy which facilitated the ratification by Ireland of the Istanbul Convention in 2019. </p><p>A central element of the progress to date has been the landmark Domestic Violence Act 2018, which came into force on 1 January 2019. Through creation of the offence of coercive control, the Act recognised in law the devastating impact that emotional abuse can have on those it is inflicted upon. The Act also improves victim&rsquo;s access to barring orders and provides greater supports for victims in the court process, in areas such as court accompaniment and to be able to give evidence by live television link. Aggravating factors in sentencing are also now provided for.</p><p>Other significant legislative developments in this area include the enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which introduced a statutory definition of consent, and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which provides a wide range of measures and services to protect and inform victims during the progress of their case through the criminal justice system.</p><p>A range of other relevant actions and projects are being pursued in this field, for example: </p><p>my Department has agreed with the Central Statistics Office that it will conduct a major National Sexual Violence Prevalence Study, which will look in detail at the experience of women and men of sexual violence and abuse in Ireland, with repeat large-scale surveys every decade, to provide a robust evidence-basis for Government policy; an independent study on domestic homicide and familicide is being carried out; a Working Group review, chaired by Tom O'Malley, BL into the adequacy of measures available to protect vulnerable witnesses during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences is nearing completion;  public awareness campaigns have been organised on domestic abuse (&quot;What would you do?&quot; which ran from 2016-2018) and sexual violence (&quot;No Excuses&quot;, which commenced in 2019 and is scheduled to run until 2021); an expanded Victims Charter has been published, providing information on the supports and services available.  This is available online at ;  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also continuously improving its specialist services and Divisional Protective Services Units are now being rolled out with specially trained officers responsible for investigations, including engagement with victims.I understand that 16 DPSUs have now been rolled out in 15 Divisions nationwide. </p><p>I would stress that implementation of the Second National Strategy is monitored on an ongoing basis and actions may be added to it by agreement of the Monitoring Committee, which as mentioned is made up of representatives from state agencies and the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to note that my Department is currently leading efforts to identify lessons which can be learned from the inter-agency plan which we put in place to address domestic abuse, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This process includes input from the community and voluntary sector working in this area.  I hope and expect that this will offer the opportunity to further strengthen our national response to the issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy will also be aware that the draft Programme for Government contains a commitment to conduct an audit of statutory responsibilities in this area.</p></reply>

It is operating in parallel with existing workplace health and safety statutory requirements. The Protocol sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers in all business sectors the steps that they must take both before a workplace reopens and on an ongoing basis. The Health and Safety Authority is the lead agency in monitoring adherence to the national Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p>  <p>  In terms of staff numbers, the Health and Safety Authority has a total staff complement of 182 which is made up of staff in administration and inspector grades. Of the 109 inspectors currently in the Authority across all grades, 67 inspectors have been made available to inspect on foot of the Return to Work Safely Protocol. This number covers both existing field inspectors as well as others redeployed internally from their existing roles. </p>  <p>  In terms of monitoring adherence to the Protocol the Health and Safety Authority inspectorate is being supplemented significantly by deploying other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities. These resources are being drawn from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environmental Health Officers employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This will result in an additional 500 or so inspectors checking compliance with the protocol as part of their normal inspection programme.  Furthermore, seven staff from my Department have been seconded to the Workplace Contact Unit of the Health and Safety Authority to assist the Authority in managing phone and email queries about the Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p>  <p>  To date in 2020, the Health and Safety Authority has recruited seven Inspectors and there are currently 11 vacancies which it is intending to fill in the coming months. The Department maintains close contact with the HSA and will be engaging with the Authority regarding it future resourcing requirements. </p>  <p>  The HSA has noted a high level of compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol to date during phases 1 and 2. Where businesses have not fully complied with the protocol, any matters that need to be addressed are the subject of the inspection report and followed up as appropriate to ensure compliance. </p>  <p>  In relation to phase 3, there will be a focus on the businesses reopening at that stage, particularly on restaurants, caf&eacute;s and pubs.  Along with the HSA&rsquo;s own inspectorate, the Environmental Health Officers have deep knowledge of that sector and they too will be inspecting in line with the public health guidance and the Protocol.  </p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy of additional guidance for pubs which back onto residential streets in order to prevent groups gathering near homes would be a matter for the Garda&iacute; where such circumstances arise.</p>  <p>  The results from the inspections to date remain encouraging and are a positive indication that both employers and employees are generally taking a responsible and proactive approach to compliance with the Protocol.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that micro and SME businesses across the economy are increasingly availing of the supports available as our economy and society reopen and I continue to keep all schemes under review.  I publish the data on the take-up of schemes on a weekly basis and the data is available at the following link to my Department's website: </p><p><i></i></p><p>Details of the main schemes are set out as follows.</p><p>The Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis. MFI has seen unprecedented levels of interest in this loan facility with loan approvals of &euro;13,698,405 in the 12 weeks since the scheme commenced. This is over double the total value of loans approved in 2019 which was &euro;6 million.  The Covid-19 Loan has supported over 500 Irish micro businesses and thousands of jobs throughout every region of Ireland.</p><p>MFI provides vital support to microenterprises by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.  It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.  This funding has provided a life-line to microenterprises struggling to cope with the economic circumstances arising from the Covid-19 crisis and will be of great assistance as these businesses re-enter the market place.</p><p>These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with interest rates of between 4.5% and 5.5% with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium.</p><p>The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme [Covid-19 WCS] is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the European Investment Fund through its InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI and offered through participating finance providers.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) that have been negatively impacted by issues arising from the outbreak of Covid-19. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m and are for periods of up to three years. Loans are offered at favourable terms, for example, the maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Uptake of the scheme to date has been positive and engagement with the participating finance providers indicates that more businesses are engaging with the application process as they seek approval for lending under the scheme. </p><p>Work is also underway on a significant expansion to the scheme to ensure that there is adequate financing available to businesses, as they seek to make the necessary adjustments to their operations to facilitate a return to trading as we progress through the phased reopening of the economy.</p><p>The Business Continuity Voucher scheme was launched on 26 March. This Voucher provided up to &euro;2,500 in consultancy costs, to develop short and long-term strategies to respond to the initial pandemic and to plan for the eventual recovery and reopening of the economy. The scheme was a resounding success in terms of uptake, the product of it being an appropriate support for that point in time. The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of vouchers and their subsequent business continuity plans. The awarding of vouchers will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the LEOs process the outstanding applications. </p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme is funded by the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment and delivered nationwide in partnership with my Department, Enterprise Ireland and the 31 LEOs. The Scheme offers skills training, mentoring and financial support of up to &euro;2,500 to help small and micro-businesses to develop their e-commerce capability. New flexibilities to the Scheme were introduced in April including reducing the requirement for co-funding from 50% to 10% and allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one. </p><p>On the 8th of June the Government announced additional funding of &euro;14.2m for the Scheme bringing the total funding allocation in 2020 to &euro;19.8m. This additional funding will allow LEOs to approve additional vouchers to successful applicants. There has been a positive response to these changes and significant uptake of the Scheme.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland, on behalf of my Department has also launched a new suite of Covid-19 supports; these are: </p><p><b>Sustaining Enterprise Fund</b>: This &euro;180 million fund will provide support to eligible manufacturing and internationally traded services companies employing 10 or more employees who have been impacted by a 15% or more reduction in actual or  projected turnover or profit, and/or have a significant increase in costs as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. The fund provides financial assistance in the form of repayable advances of up to a maximum of &euro;800,000 per company.  This fund also provides a &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000 short-term working capital injection to eligible smaller companies to support business continuity and strengthen their ability to return to growth and be trading strongly in three years time.</p><p><b>Covid-19 &ndash; HPSU Fund (SEF&ndash; HPSU):</b>This fund is aimed at EI High Potential Start-Up companies which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic are facing delays to projected sales growth and whose  fundraising plans are significantly impacted or stalled. Under this fund, HPSUs can apply for co-investment of &euro;50,000 per undertaking  in the form of equity or convertible debt instruments.</p><p>In addition to this fund Enterprise Ireland has launched the following supports:</p><p><b>Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant:</b>A &euro;5,000 grant for eligible companies to work with third party consultants to prepare a detailed financial plan with forecasts and assumptions. 337 applications have been received for Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant.</p><p><b>Lean Business Continuity Voucher: </b>A &euro;2,500 voucher for eligible companies to access training or advisory services support related to the continued operation of their business during the current pandemic. 156 applications have been received for the LEAN Business Continuity Voucher.</p><p><b>Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme</b>is a grant for retail companies with greater than 10 employees to develop a more competitive online offer.  This competitive call has a budget of &euro;2 million. Successful applicants will receive funding support of up to 80% of project costs, with a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.</p><p>Most recently, the Government launched the Restart Grant which provides direct grant aid to micro and small businesses. The grant of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;10,000 provides a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers.  It is administered through the local authorities.</p><p>I will continue to keep the take up of supports under review and we will adjust and develop new measures as the economy continues to reopen. </p></reply>

The launch of the &euro;250m Restart Grant by Government on the 22 May last is an example of how I am continually looking at the most appropriate mechanisms to help businesses as we reopen our economy. The Restart Grant provide a direct payment to local businesses of between &euro;2,000 to &euro;10,000 to help them meet the costs of reopening.</p><p>The range of supports available from my Department and across Government are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>The full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness.</p><p>In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p><p>The Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis and is working successfully.  In 2.5 months, MFI has approved Covid-19 loans of over &euro;14.3 million, which is more than double the value of total loans approved for the entire year in 2019.</p><p>These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid ver the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period.</p><p>An interest rate to 4.5% applies on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI.  This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%. As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan.</p><p>The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility.  The scheme is operated by the SBCI.</p><p>It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 million to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following a further announcement, work is now under way on a significant expansion to this Scheme.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) negatively impacted by Covid-19. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m and are for periods of up to three years. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured.</p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme is funded by the Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment and delivered nationwide in partnership with my Department, Enterprise Ireland and the 31 Local Enterprise Offices. There has been a tremendous demand for the scheme from enterprises across the country since its expansion and I am pleased that it provides a grant of up to &euro;2,500 to cover up to 90% of the cost for a business going online.</p><p>On the 8th of June I announced additional funding of &euro;14.2m for the Scheme bringing the total funding allocation in 2020 to &euro;19.8m. This additional funding will allow LEOs to approve additional vouchers to successful applicants. The Scheme offers skills training, mentoring and financial support of up to &euro;2,500 to help small and micro-businesses to develop their ecommerce capability. New flexibilities to the Scheme were introduced in April including reducing the requirement for co-funding from 50% to 10% and allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one. There has been a positive response to these changes and significant uptake of the Scheme.</p><p>Continued support for high-potential start-ups and the wider entrepreneurship base remains critically important to underpinning the growth and recovery of Irish enterprise. Through my agency&rsquo;s support for High Potential Start-Ups, Seed and Venture Capital funding, the Competitive Start Fund and New Frontiers Programme, Enterprise Ireland continues to deliver strong support for entrepreneurs and early stage companies.</p><p>Ongoing activities in this area include a call for proposals under the Competitive Start Fund in March of this year, the purpose of which is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capacity to succeed in global markets. Enterprise Ireland continues to provide equity investment of up to &euro;800,000 on a co-funded basis, to innovation-led high potential start-ups that are developing and commercialising new or substantially improved technologies, products or services. In addition, the Enterprise Ireland is currently engaged in the second call of its Seed and Venture Capital Scheme (2019-2024), targeting funds investing into companies emerging from the third-level research organisations (Spin Outs).</p><p>Enterprise Ireland has launched liquidity funding supports for companies who have been impacted by COVID- 19, either through a reduction in turnover/profit or a significant increase in costs. The purpose of this funding is to enable the company to firstly, stabilise, and then, to implement a business sustainment plan, leading to a return to viability and contributing to the recovery of the Irish economy. Support of up to &euro;800,000 can be provided to companies, with different levels of support and funding instruments available, which are targeted at companies at different stages of development and growth (e.g. established companies, start-ups and small enterprises).</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and with all stakeholders, to examine all such appropriate business supports to assist microbusinesses impacted by Covid-19.</p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme was to provide expert guidance and advice to SMEs employing up 50 people and enable business owners make informed decisions about what immediate measures and remedial actions could be taken at the outset of this crisis, to protect staff and sales and eventually help the business recover.</p><p>The scheme was a resounding success in terms of uptake, the product of it being an appropriate support for that point in time. The Local Enterprise Offices have thus far approved 9,389 Business Continuity Vouchers to the value of almost &euro;20.6m and had received 14,829 applications by the closing date. The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of BCV vouchers and their subsequent business continuity plans. The awarding and processing of vouchers under the BCV scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications.</p><p>The payment of the Business Continuity Voucher is dependent on the project being finished, invoice and project report submitted to LEO, with the LEO subsequently completing  due diligence checks and processing by Local Authority Finance Units. Details on the take-up of the Vouchers is available on my Department's website at: .</p><p>Clearly the level of demand both for the scheme and the consequent budget drawdown has been unprecedented, with approvals to date to the value of &euro;20.6m representing a substantial portion of the existing LEO budget for 2020. To date, in general, the new Covid-19 business support Schemes have been supported through both a reprioritisation of my Department's and our development agencies budgets for 2020 and through securing additional funding or commitments to fund for specific schemes. This is a continually evolving situation and my Department is continually reviewing take-up of schemes and the need for reallocations or additional budgets.</p><p>Business Continuity Voucher applicants who have been unsuccessful have been offered a range of other supports that they can avail of such as the Local Enterprise Office Mentor Programme. This programme is designed to enable clients to work with an experienced mentor to identify solutions to areas of exposure within their business. With advice and guidance from their mentor, clients develop strategies that are more robust, which address business planning issues and maximise potential business opportunities. These mentoring services are now free of charge.</p><p>Furthermore, Local Enterprise Offices have moved training programmes, workshops and networking meet-ups online, covering areas such as cash management in a crisis, leading your business through COVID-19 and advice for employers impacted by the crisis. Training programmes are offered completely free of charge or there is a nominal fee and places can be booked online, through this link: .</p><p>As the reopening of the economy proceeds, more and more businesses are transitioning from the planning to the implementation phase as we progress through the remaining stages of the Government Roadmap. It is in this context that the Business Continuity Voucher is being phased out and is now closed to new applicants. In recognition of this new stage the new &euro;250m Restart Grant was introduced to assist micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures.</p></reply>

Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term.</p><p>The objective of the &euro;2 million Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme - a competitive scheme, administered on my Department's behalf by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector who have already started an online journey, to further enhance and strengthen their online presence, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer.</p><p>My Department proposed this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability.  Applicant companies must be an indigenous retailer, employing 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme.</p><p>This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way. Further details on this Scheme are available at .</p><p>The Scheme closed for applications at 3pm on 27 May 2020 and eligible applications are currently under assessment by Enterprise Ireland against the criteria specified in the Scheme. Once the assessment is complete I will be in a position to announce the successful applicants and the funding that has been allocated to them under this Call of the Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that I recently announced, with Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Richard Bruton, a major expansion of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme to help small and micro enterprises, with up to 10 employees, including those in the retail sector, to get online quickly.</p><p>The Trading Online Voucher Scheme is being expanded by &euro;14.2m after the Local Enterprise Offices received 3 years&rsquo; worth of applications in 3 months following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland.

For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>The full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness.</p><p>In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p><p>The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 million to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following a further announcement this Scheme is now being significantly expanded. The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) negatively impacted by Covid-19. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m and are for periods of up to three years. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme currently makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through participating lenders. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019, resulting in a rapid take up of the scheme. Funding made available by the scheme facilitates long-term, strategic investment.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees), including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for farmers) to &euro;3m per eligible business, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available unsecured. The initial maximum interest rate is capped at 4.5% for loans up to &euro;249,999 and 3.5% for loans more than or equal to &euro;250,000 for the first six months. These rates represent a significant saving compared with the prevailing rates that are otherwise being offered for similar loans on the market.</p><p>This scheme has been expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to COVID-19 impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>The Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the Covid-19 crisis. These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit. Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period.</p><p>An interest rate to 4.5% applies on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI. This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%. As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan.</p><p>Government has agreed a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and this is a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available. This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment. It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.</p><p>The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including provincial and local papers. It will also have interest rates below current market rates. The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has commenced.</p><p>There are a number of liquidity supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses available now, including the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme which was implemented in 2012, supporting loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years. The scheme is designed to support a range of debt products appropriate to the borrowing needs of SMEs. An application to access the Credit Guarantee Scheme can be made through one of the participating lenders which are currently Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.</p><p>My Department is encouraging any affected business to take advantage of the LEO COVID-19 supports. The situation is still developing from day to day and the Government continues to respond to these developments in an effort to protect and support Irish businesses. The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of Business Continuity Vouchers (BCV) and their subsequent business continuity plans. The awarding of vouchers under the BCV scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications.</p><p>InterTradeIreland launched two new business supports, these are currently being targeted at companies who are already on one of their programs.</p><p>E-merge enables companies to engage consultancy support &amp;amp; advice (to the value of &pound;2500/&euro;2800) to help them develop online sales &amp;amp; ecommerce solutions.</p><p>Emergency Business Solutions: Fully funded consultancy support &amp;amp; advice (to the value of &pound;2000/&euro;2250) to address key business challenges in areas such as emergency cashflow, loan applications and HR/People.</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak will result in a serious downturn in the Irish, EU and wider global economy. The downturn will be sudden and wide reaching. Businesses, the labour market and household spending will all be negatively impacted. In particular, the Restart Grant provides direct grant aid to micro and small businesses and some provincial and local newspapers. The grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers.</p><p>Funding in respect to the Restart Grant is provided by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and is administered by the 31 Local Authorities.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 and will continue to keep the supports provided for enterprise under review.</p></reply>

The objective is to assist people in assessing their idea, its viability and to decide if they should proceed or take a step back.</p><p>All LEOs also offer a number of &lsquo;soft&rsquo; supports in the form of training or mentoring such as:</p><p><b>- The Mentor Programme</b>which is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance.</p><p><b>- The LEO Management Development programmes</b>which provide the owner-manager with the management, leadership, business skills and knowledge to achieve sustainability and growth in their business.</p><p><b>- LEAN for Micro</b>which is a targeted programme for Local Enterprise Office clients to help small businesses boost competitiveness, increase performance and profitability as well a building resilience within their companies.</p><p>Further to this, if a potential business is not eligible for direct grant aid, an entrepreneur with a viable business proposal can also  make an application through their LEO to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of standard loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI of 6.8% if they make their application through the LEOs.</p><p>If a business is a micro-enterprise which is impacted by COVID-19 resulting in a reduction of 15% or more in actual or projected turnover or profit and the business is having difficulty in accessing finance from commercial lending providers, the MFI COVID-19 Business Loan up to &euro;50,000 may be able to support your business. Discounted interest rate of 4.5% APR is available if their loan application is submitted through the Local Enterprise Office.</p><p>In terms of aspiring entrepreneurs and new businesses, I am satisfied that there is a comprehensive suite of supports available and that these supports are accessible in rural towns through the 31 Local Enterprise Offices across the country.</p></reply>

Further work will be carried out in the coming days and weeks to determine which actions will take place in each phase.  Updates to the roadmap can be found at www.gov.ie.</p><p>The Roadmap is a living document and Government has demonstrated great flexibility in its decision to accelerate the phases as set out in the original Roadmap.</p><p>The input and advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) informed the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with Phase 2 and to accelerate elements of the Roadmap. The Government also had regard to a paper which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide an updated assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify, from an economic perspective, some priority issues for re-opening of economic activity under Phase 2. This paper, &ldquo;Economic Considerations for Reinstating Economic Activity - Update for Phase 2&rdquo;, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>On 8th June the Minister for Health, Simon Harris T.D., signed SI No.206 of 2020, Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions)(COVID-19)(No. 2) Regulations. These Regulations, which shall remain in operation until 29th June, provide for the unwinding of certain restrictions, including the reopening of retail outlets and extending the distance that may be travelled for specified purposes. The Regulations also provide for continued restrictions for some businesses or services and for offences, including in relation to events. Businesses should carefully review these Regulations. Gymnasiums (whether indoors or outdoors) are listed in Schedule 2 as among the businesses and services not permitted to open at this time.</p><p>Businesses should also review the Roadmap and the updates carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures. Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures. It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and employees the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at .</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace. If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie.</p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country. I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so. My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors under Phases 1 and 2 and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the remaining Phases in the Roadmap.</p><p>It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in the next two phases of the Roadmap will be informed by the public health advice at the time.</p></reply>

That often involves daily engagement with senior management of firms to help grow and sustain their respective presence across the country. This close cooperation is one of the reasons that 2019 was another record year for foreign direct investment (FDI) driven employment in Ireland, with 245,000 people employed in 1,500 IDA client firms.</p>  <p>  The economic impact of Covid-19 will, however, unfortunately also be felt in the FDI sector. The IDA is already working closely with affected companies and key stakeholders to help mitigate job losses and to attract new investment that can create new employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  In more general terms, it remains the case that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is outward-facing and export-orientated. That openness has been a key part of our economic success, particularly in the context of our recovery from the global economic crisis that began in 2008. However, multinational companies do sometimes make decisions about their global operations that can lead to job losses here. We very much regret when that happens but it is a reality of the globalised environment in which our economy operates. That is why we constantly work hard, both through the IDA and across Government, to attract new investment to Ireland that can help offset job losses when they do occur. Securing such new investment for the country will remain a key priority in the time ahead, particularly as we seek to recover from the economic impact of Covid-19.</p></reply>

However, inspectors from the Health and Safety Authority do keep a record of any communications they have with safety representatives at a place of work.</p>  <p>  The Return to Work Safely Protocol specifically recommends that an employer should appoint a least one-worker representative whose role is to work collaboratively with the employer to assist in the implementation of the public health measures set out in the Protocol and monitor adherence to the measures to prevent the spread of COVID -19. In relation to inspections carried out since 18 May 2020 inspectors found that 756 COVID-19 worker representatives have been appointed which was 53% of the total inspections. Health and Safety Authority inspectors would have communicated with these worker representatives as they met them on inspections.

Located in the 31 Local Authorities Offices nationwide, the LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p><p>It should be noted that while seasonal food businesses do not qualify for grant support, there are however other supports available to the seasonal food sector. For example seasonal food businesses can benefit from training and development through the &quot;Food Starter Programme&quot; which is now being run remotely and the new e-hub called the &quot;Digital School of Food&quot; with all details available on the LEOs website at www.localenterprise.ie.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Office network also runs regular webinars in relation to supports for food businesses and I am including the following YouTube link to &lsquo;Lunch &amp;amp; Learn&rsquo; webinar which took place recently. The theme was: Supports for Food &amp;amp; Drink Producers -  .</p><p>I would urge seasonal food producers to talk to their Local Enterprise Offices regarding the supports available as they offer advice, training and mentoring which could be extremely beneficial to a business.</p><p>The full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant supports will be available to firms to help with strategies to innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. For seasonal businesses wishing to have an on-line presence, the Local Enterprise Office trading on-line voucher is designed to assist small businesses with up to 10 employees.

For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>The COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme which is offered in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility and is available to the hospitality sector. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. The Scheme is providing a fund of up to &euro;250 million to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of COVID-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following a further announcement, work is now under way on a significant expansion to this Scheme.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees) negatively impacted by COVID-19. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m and are for periods of up to three years. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme currently makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through participating lenders. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019, resulting in a rapid take up of the scheme. Funding made available by the scheme facilitates long-term, strategic investment.</p><p>The scheme is open to eligible SMEs and small mid-caps (businesses of up to 499 employees), including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for farmers) to &euro;3m per eligible business, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available unsecured. The initial maximum interest rate is capped at 4.5% for loans up to &euro;249,999 and 3.5% for loans more than or equal to &euro;250,000 for the first six months. These rates represent a significant saving compared with the prevailing rates that are otherwise being offered for similar loans on the market.</p><p>This scheme is being expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to COVID-19-impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>The COVID-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them access funding arising from the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to COVID-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit. Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period.</p><p>An interest rate to 4.5% applies on the COVID-19 loans provided by MFI. This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%. As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan.</p><p>Government has agreed a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, and this is a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available. This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment. It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.</p><p>The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors including the hospitality sector and includes primary producers. It will also have interest rates below current market rates. The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has commenced.</p><p>There are a number of liquidity supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses available now, including the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme which was implemented in 2012, supporting loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years. The scheme is designed to support a range of debt products appropriate to the borrowing needs of SMEs. An application to access the Credit Guarantee Scheme can be made through one of the participating lenders which are currently Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.</p><p>The Hospitality Sector would be eligible for all LEO supports including Lean and Mentoring. They are also eligible for a Trading Online Voucher provided they meet the following criteria:</p><p>- Limited or no e-commerce presence;</p><p>- 10 or less employees;</p><p>- Turnover less than &euro;2m;</p><p>- Applicant business must be trading for at least 6 months;</p><p>- Business must be located in the area covered by the LEO to whom they make their application i.e. LEOs cannot accept applications from businesses located outside their jurisdiction. Regrettably they are not eligible for grant support.</p><p>- The &euro;250m Restart Grant which is being administered by the local authorities, providing direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures.</p><p>- Eligible businesses who have stayed open throughout the crisis, as well as those who are reopening under Phase 1 (from 18<sup>th</sup>May) and Phase 2 (8<sup>th</sup>June) of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, are encouraged to apply first for the Restart Grant. These applications will be prioritised for payment by the local authorities.</p><p>- To avail of the Restart Grant, applicants must be a commercial business and be in the Local Authorities Commercial Rates Payment System and:</p><p>- have an annual turnover of less than &euro;5m and employ 50 people or less;</p><p>- have suffered a projected 25%+ loss in turnover between 1 April and end June 2020; </p><p>- commit to remain open or to reopen if it was closed;</p><p>- declare the intention to retain employees that are on The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p><p>The grant will be the amount of the rates demand in respect of calendar year 2019 only, subject to a minimum of &euro;2,000 and a maximum of &euro;10,000.  The Restart Grant support is just one part of the wider &euro;12bn package of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.</p><p>Further targeted supports specifically aimed at the tourism sector will be initiated and led by my colleague the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who has recently formed a special Tourism Recovery Taskforce dedicated to spearheading economic recovery for the tourism sector.  For further information see .  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 and will continue to keep the supports provided for enterprise under review.</p></reply>

Last year my Department published the Remote Work in Ireland report.  This research paper was dedicated to understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce, the attitudes towards such arrangements, and the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working. </p>  <p>  A key outcome identified in the Remote Work in Ireland report was the need for official guidance for employers and employees on a variety of different topics, such as equality, health and safety, employment conditions and the right to disconnect, data protection and training. </p>  <p>  To build on this work, I committed to the establishment of an Interdepartmental Group comprising of all relevant Departments and Agencies to align approaches and develop clear guidance on remote work for employers and employees.  This Group has been formed and is currently steering the development of guidance on this topic.  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is one of a number of organisations on this Group that are helping to inform the shape of this guidance.  We will also be engaging with various stakeholder groups on this as it progresses. It is expected that the guidance will be completed by the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that, in response to the shift towards homeworking as result of COVID-19 pandemic, the HSA has created a page on its website outlining the safety, health and welfare at work requirements when temporarily working from home.  This page is useful to employers in terms of outlining the specific duties they have when their employees are working from home.

This counter guarantee has enabled &euro;15 million in Exchequer funding to be leveraged to provide &euro;200 million in lending through this Scheme.  This is reflective of an effort to achieve the widest reach with Exchequer funding to support businesses as they seek to respond the impacts of Covid-19 and why loan guarantee structures are a key response to the liquidity crisis.</p>  <p>  The scheme is available to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. </p>  <p>  The scheme is operated by the SBCI and is offered through participating finance providers.  This allows the Government to leverage existing lending infrastructure, providing an efficient mechanism for making competitive lending products available to Covid-19-impacted businesses, and there are significant advantages to loan schemes run through the participating finance providers.</p>  <p>  The interest rate of 4% under the Covid-19 WCS represents a savings when compared with other similar lending available in the market, while the availability of loans of under &euro;500,000 unsecured ensures that these schemes are more accessible to businesses.</p>  <p>However, the operation of loan schemes of this type through these financial providers also means that there is less scope to bring the interest rates down further, as some interest must be charged by the lenders to cover overheads and capital costs if they are to continue to work with Government.</p>  <p>  The level of capital held by Irish banks against SME loans relates to the high level of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the Irish Banking System during the financial crisis.  Notwithstanding improvements in the period since then, there is still a continuing high stock of NPLs in the Irish Banking System.  The resulting high levels of required capital means that banks in Ireland charge a higher interest rates than is found on average in the EU so as to be able to generate an appropriate return on equity. </p>  <p>  Further to this, the Covid-19 WCS operates under the de minimis state aid regulations.  This limits the overall volume of state funding available to individual businesses in any given three-year period.  Any adjustment to the interest rate under the scheme would affect the consideration of the level of aid being provided to applicant businesses.  This would impact the overall volume of funding available to applicant businesses and could impact their eligibility for other schemes. </p>  <p>  Uptake of the scheme to date has been strong and work is under way on a significant expansion to make additional lending available under the scheme.</p></reply>

In all instances where financial assistance is approved by the IDA for a client company, the Agency and the client enter into a grant agreement which is a legal and binding contract.

The Business Continuity Voucher provided up to &euro;2,500 in consultancy costs, to develop short and long-term strategies to respond to the initial pandemic and to plan for the eventual recovery and reopening of the economy. </p><p>As the reopening of the economy proceeds, more and more businesses are transitioning from the planning to the implementation phase as we progress through the remaining stages of the Government Roadmap.  It is in this context that the Business Continuity Voucher was phased out and is now closed to new applicants.  In recognition of this new stage, the new &euro;250m Restart Grant was introduced to assist micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures.</p><p>The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of Business Continuity Voucher vouchers and their subsequent business continuity plans.  The awarding of vouchers under the Business Continuity Voucher scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications.  </p><p>The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m employing up to 50 people, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% projected reduction in turnover to the end of June 2020.

The NOCT, along with local Outbreak Control Teams, is in place to address outbreaks of COVID-19 and to recommend steps and measures to ensure that outbreaks can be managed and brought under control as quickly as possible.  COVID-19 is first and foremost a public health issue so the first step must always be ensuring that measures are in place to manage and prevent outbreaks not just for the workers involved but also for the wider community where such workers live. </p><p>The total number of Health and Safety Authority inspections that have been carried out at meat processing plants in 2020 is 30 and this covers both meat processing and poultry processing plants.

Ireland&rsquo;s Sustaining Enterprise Fund Scheme is available until the end of the year which is a timeframe set within the EU Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework.  The nature of the business supports under this framework is a matter for individual member states and is dependent upon the different size of economies and targeted sectors of the economies. </p><p>There is a limited amount of resources available and a broad range of businesses with different needs for support.

The nature of the business supports under this framework is a matter for individual member states and is dependent upon the different size of economies and targeted sectors of the economies. </p><p>The &euro;180 million Sustaining Enterprise Fund which Ireland successfully negotiated with the EU Commission under the temporary framework, is just one part of the wider &euro;12bn package of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, restart grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs. </p><p>The nature of the business supports under the temporary framework is a matter for individual member states and is dependent upon the different size of economies and targeted sectors of the economies. </p><p>There is a limited amount of resources available and a broad range of businesses with different needs for support. I am looking to achieve the widest reach within the available Exchequer funding as urgently and as quickly as possible.  The loan guarantee scheme structures, for example, are a key response to the liquidity crisis, as they allow Ireland to leverage Exchequer monies to provide much larger funds to businesses, in particular where it is feasible to access counter guarantees through the European Investment Bank.  Supports to businesses, including grants, provided through the Exchequer funding should support viable business across all sectors and across the variety of needs. </p><p>My Department, working with its agencies, are continually reviewing the situation and I am informed that Enterprise Ireland is working with SMEs client companies to support the stabilisation of their business so that they can undertake a developmental programme focused on recovery and growth.  To support companies the agency has:</p><p>- Developed and launched a suite of new funding supports utilising the additional flexibility permitted under the Sustaining Enterprise Fund.</p><p>- Set up a Business Response Hub to provide information to companies on what supports are available to assist with their specific needs.  To date the agency has supported many companies through the Hub.</p><p>As a first step, SMEs need to stabilise their business with key elements including business planning and accessing liquidity.  Once a company has a financial and business continuity plan, Enterprise Ireland can provide funding for companies who have been impacted by COVID- 19, either through a reduction in turnover/profit or a significant increase in costs.  The purpose of this funding is to enable the company to stabilise and implement a business sustainment plan, leading to a return to viability and contributing to the recovery of the Irish economy.  New supports introduced to support this include:</p><p>Planning Supports</p><p>- Lean Business Continuity Support: This &euro;2.5k grant supports companies to access training or advisory services related to crisis management, sustaining operations, moving to e-business/online and planning for resilience post crisis.  Reflecting the practical and immediate nature of this support, company interest and demand has been strong.</p><p>- COVID-19 Business Financial Planning Grant: This grant of up to &euro;5k provides 100 per cent funding for companies to access a financial consultant to prepare a financial plan to assist companies:</p><p>- understand their immediate financial position, secure the finance required to survive and provide a framework to sustain the business; and</p><p>- ensure they have a framework to identify and manage costs and gaps in funding.</p><p>- This is a critical support for a company to strengthen their position to identify funding needs and access required funding to implement their business plan.</p><p>- Liquidity Support</p><p>- The agency&rsquo;s liquidity and medium-term financial supports are being delivered under the Sustaining Enterprise Fund. Support of up to &euro;800,000 can be provided to companies, with different levels of support and funding instruments available, which are targeted at companies at different stages of development and growth (e.g. established companies, start-ups and small enterprises).</p><p>- The agency is actively working with companies to prepare applications for funding under the Sustaining Enterprise Fund.</p><p>The &euro;250m Restart Grant which is also an approved Scheme under the EU&rsquo;s Temporary Framework for State aid, in fact gives direct non-repayable grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures.  The grants are equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000. </p><p>Indigenous Irish companies are the backbone of the economy and I can assure the Deputy that the officials in my Department are working with all our agencies to monitor the needs of sectors and companies and provide new supports to meet changing company needs, as required. </p><p>For further information and regular updates as they develop are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at: <i></i>.</p></reply>

It will provide large-scale financial support to reforms and investments undertaken in every Member State including Ireland, with the aims of mitigating the economic and social impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  The Facility also has the aim of making the EU economies more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for the challenges posed by the green and digital transitions.  I will be working to ensure Ireland is at the forefront of these changes to the business environment. </p>  <p>  The fund will assist Ireland in addressing the challenges identified in the European Semester, in areas such as competitiveness, productivity, environmental sustainability, education and skills, health, employment, and economic, social and territorial cohesion.  It is important to note the focus on the green and digital transition agendas which will require considerable focus by the Government to assist Irish businesses, particularly SMEs.  The Facility is focused on longer term reforms and will help Irish businesses to create and sustain their firms and their employees.  It will be a mechanism for the businesses of the Member States of the European Union to strengthen their position in the global market. </p>  <p>  The Facility will work in tandem with the range of Commission measures already developed in response to the current coronavirus pandemic such as amendment to the cohesion policy regulation, the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiatives and SURE.  I will be working with my Government colleagues to make sure Ireland is best placed to take advantage of these considerable funds and Irish businesses will reap the reward of this engagement. </p></reply>

Further work is being carried out in the coming days and weeks to determine which actions will take place in each phase. Updates to the roadmap can be found at .  Organisations should review the Roadmap and the updates carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen. </p><p>The<b></b>National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for organisations in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures.  It sets out in very clear terms for employers, employees and artists the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate.  Further guidance is available from the Health and Safety Authority which is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace.  The HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>With regards to the reopening of theatres, the Theatre Forum has published guidelines for the reopening of arts centres and these have been welcomed by the Arts Council.  These guidelines which can be accessed here <i>www.theatreforum.ie/assets/uploads/Re-opening-Arts-Centres_Doc-v.1.1.pdf</i>should assist arts centres and other cultural facilities throughout the country to consider how they might prepare to re-open under totally changed circumstances.  The guidelines recognise arts centres as places of work for artists, and as places for audiences to participate and engage with the arts.</p><p>The Arts Council has established a short-term Advisory Group to identify ways to address impacts of the Covid-19 Crisis on the sector.  This group brings together a number of leading voices from the arts and other sectors and will report to the Arts Council on measures to sustain the arts sector through the current challenging period including the challenges posed by reopening.  I understand that the Group will complete their work shortly and I look forward to receiving their report. </p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently published guidelines for the tourism sector in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap and which were prepared in consultation with the tourism industry and relevant authorities.

Further work will be carried out in the coming days and weeks to determine which actions will take place in each phase.  Updates to the roadmap can be found at www.gov.ie.  </p><p>The Roadmap is a living document and Government has demonstrated great flexibility in its decision to accelerate the phases as set out in the original Roadmap.  </p><p>The input and advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) informed the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with Phase 2 and to accelerate elements of the Roadmap.  The Government also had regard to a paper which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide an updated assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify, from an economic perspective, some priority issues for re-opening of economic activity under Phase 2.  This paper, &ldquo;Economic Considerations for Reinstating Economic Activity - Update for Phase 2&rdquo;, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i></i>. </p><p>On 8 June the Minister for Health, Simon Harris T.D., signed SI No.206 of 2020, Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions)(COVID-19)(No. 2) Regulations.  These Regulations, which shall remain in operation until 29 June, provide for the unwinding of certain restrictions, including the reopening of retail outlets and extending the distance that may be travelled for specified purposes.  The Regulations also provide for continued restrictions for some businesses or services and for offences, including in relation to events. Businesses should carefully review these Regulations. </p><p>Where a business is not specifically listed, businesses should review the Roadmap and the updates carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen. </p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures.  It sets out in very clear terms for employers and employees the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate.  The Protocol is available at <i></i>. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.  These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead.  For a full list of supports for business please see <i></i>. </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country.  I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors under Phases 1 and 2 and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the remaining phases in the Roadmap. </p><p>It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in the next two phases of the Roadmap will be informed by the public health advice at the time.</p></reply>

The economic analysis undertaken by my Department has highlighted the challenges for SMEs arising from COVID-19 which have been immediate and heavily impactful on certain sectors.  As highlighted in my two published reports, Economic Considerations for Reinstating Economic Activity Phase 1 and Phase 2, GDP is projected to decline by over 10% in 2020.  The heightened risk of a hard Brexit at the end of 2020 could exacerbate the difficulties facing the economy and recovery prospects.</p>  <p>  SMEs across all sectors are being impacted, with for example the Accommodation and Food sector continuing to be the hardest hit so far with over 90% of those in employment now receiving either the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) or the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).  The Wholesale and Retail sector, despite large elements continuing to trade, has some 58% of employees either on the PUP or TWSS. Personal services, construction and administrative and support services have also been heavily impacted.  The manufacturing sector, FDI and globally traded sectors have had less severe impacts to date. However, it is too early yet to assess the impact on global trade and, given the important of these sectors, we will continue to monitor and keep under close review. </p>  <p>  The impact of COVID-19 on the public finances has been significant with the total value of measures introduced to date (including expenditure and liquidity) standing at over &euro;13 billion.  Around 40% of those previously in employment are still on COVID-19 related income support payments.  </p>  <p>  In responding to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 crisis, I and my Department has been actively engaged across all sectors and working closely with other government departments and a wide range of stakeholders in recent months.  I chair the Enterprise Forum which comprises the main SME representative bodies including ISME, Small Firms Association and Chambers Ireland and will continue to review what new initiatives are required.    </p>  <p>  I have tailored and developed a suite of supports to help businesses impacted by COVID-19 and minimise the extent of the economic damage caused by the pandemic.  I have worked collectively with my Offices, Agencies and other government bodies to achieve maximum impact.  This comprehensive suite of supports involves a mix of grants, vouchers, low-cost loans and credit guarantees, all of which, when combined with other supports, such as write-off of commercial rates, wage subsidies and deferred tax liabilities, will help to improve cash flow for businesses and help them to restart, reconnect and rehire staff.  The details of all schemes are set out in our Guide to Supports for Businesses, which is available on our website.</p>  <p>  I have also developed and put in place extensive information supports from an early stage in my Department.  On 13th March I established a dedicated COVID-19 Business Call Centre to assist SMEs with information on the various new and existing schemes and financial supports available.  A new team, drawn from across the Department, was set up with a dedicated helpline phone number and email address.  The team, all working remotely has now dealt with in excess of 5,000 calls to date across a wide range of issues.  This Unit is also dealing with COVID-19 related representations and, in the week ending 5th June, have received a total of 803 reps, with 764 finalised.  At an early stage, we also wrote to 230,000 companies advising them of the range of business supports on offer to assist firms in their COVID-19 response.  We also published extensive information in our Guide to Supports for Businesses.  This is a living document detailing the range of COVID-19 business supports and other Government supports available and we will continue to update the guide as we introduce new measures. </p></reply>

For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>The full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p><p>In that regard, Government will continue to examine additional measures needed for all enterprises, SMEs and micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any additional mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p><p>In terms of forthcoming schemes for SMEs, I would highlight in particular that the Government has agreed a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available from AIB, BOI and Ulster Bank.  This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment.  It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years.  The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less. </p><p>The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers.  It will also have interest rates below current market rates.  The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has been approved by Government, and my officials are working with the Office of the Parliamentary counsel on this drafting work. </p><p>Work is also under way to extend existing schemes in place to support access to finance for businesses to ensure that they can continue to offer support to businesses as they look towards reopening.  These include the Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme. </p><p>The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme makes lending available to eligible businesses that have been negatively impacted by issues arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland as they seek to innovate, change or adapt in response to this disruption.  Loans under this scheme are for up to three years and range from &euro;25,000 up to &euro;1.5 million (first &euro;500,000 unsecured) with a maximum interest rate of 4%.</p><p>Future Growth Loan Scheme provides long term loans of 8-10 years to businesses at low interest rates.  There has been significant demand for the scheme and the initial funding has been almost fully subscribed.  This expansion will further support the needs of SMEs, including primary producers, impacted by COVID-19.  This new funding will be released in tranches.  The long-term nature of these loans is particularly important for businesses as they plan for recovery.  Work is under way to deliver this funding as quickly as possible. </p><p>My Department is encouraging any affected business to take advantage of the LEO COVID-19 supports.  The situation is still developing from day to day and the Government continues to respond to these developments in an effort to protect and support Irish businesses. The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of Business Continuity Vouchers (BCV) and their subsequent business continuity plans.  The awarding of vouchers under the BCV scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications. </p><p>InterTradeIreland launched two new business supports, these are currently being targeted at companies who are already on one of their programs.  E-merge enables companies to engage consultancy support &amp;amp; advice (to the value of &pound;2,500/&euro;2,800) to help them develop online sales &amp;amp; ecommerce solutions. </p><p>Emergency Business Solutions: Fully funded consultancy support &amp;amp; advice (to the value of &pound;2000/&euro;2250) to address key business challenges in areas such as emergency cashflow, loan applications and HR/People.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the Irish and global economy.  COVID-19 has emerged as a sudden and profound disruptor.  Both globally and nationally, it is unclear how deep the impact will be or how long it will last.  The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting significant challenges for SMEs, the impact of which varies by sector and region.  Following a strong 2019 performance, companies focused on internationalisation and growth at the start of 2020 are facing new, and unplanned for, challenges.</p><p>My Department working with its agencies are continually reviewing the situation and I am informed that Enterprise Ireland is working with SMEs client companies to support the stabilisation of their business so that they can undertake a developmental programme focused on recovery and growth.  To support companies the agency has: </p><p>- Developed and launched a suite of new funding supports utilising the additional flexibility permitted under Ireland&rsquo;s Sustaining Enterprise Scheme supporting undertakings affected by the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak under the Temporary Framework for State Aid Measure to Support the Economy in the Current COVID-19 Outbreak. </p><p>- Set up a Business Response Hub to provide information to companies on what supports are available to assist with their specific needs.  To date the agency has supported many companies through the Hub.</p><p>- As a first step, SMEs need to stabilise their business with key elements including business planning and accessing liquidity.  Once a company has a financial and business continuity plan, Enterprise Ireland can provide funding for companies who have been impacted by COVID- 19, either through a reduction in turnover/profit or a significant increase in costs.  The purpose of this funding is to enable the company to stabilise and implement a business sustainment plan, leading to a return to viability and contributing to the recovery of the Irish economy.  New supports introduced to support this include:</p><p>Planning Supports </p><p>- Lean Business Continuity Support: This &euro;2.5k grant supports companies to access training or advisory services related to crisis management, sustaining operations, moving to e-business/online and planning for resilience post crisis.  Reflecting the practical and immediate nature of this support, company interest and demand has been strong. </p><p>- COVID-19 Business Financial Planning Grant: This grant of up to &euro;5k provides 100 per cent funding for companies to access a financial consultant to prepare a financial plan to assist companies: </p><p>- understand their immediate financial position, secure the finance required to survive and provide a framework to sustain the business; and </p><p>- ensure they have a framework to identify and manage costs and gaps in funding. </p><p>- This is a critical support for a company to strengthen their position to identify funding needs and access required funding to implement their business plan. </p><p>- Liquidity Support </p><p>- Sustaining Enterprise Fund: The agency&rsquo;s liquidity and medium-term financial supports are being delivered under the Sustaining Enterprise Fund. Support of up to &euro;800,000 can be provided to companies, with different levels of support and funding instruments available, which are targeted at companies at different stages of development and growth (e.g. established companies, start-ups and small enterprises). </p><p>- The agency is actively working with companies to prepare applications for funding under the Sustaining Enterprise Fund. </p><p>In addition to the immediate COVID-19 response, Enterprise Ireland continues to strongly focus on supporting companies to invest in innovation, competitiveness and market diversification.  These activities are critical to underpinning the long-term development and growth of Irish enterprise.  As part of this, the agency: </p><p>- Is utilising its client engagement model to work with client companies on a one-to-one basis to establish company need and will tailor a support package utilising the full suite of supports offered by the agency. </p><p>- Is delivering non-financial supports, such as the market intelligence, available via the agency&rsquo;s global network of 40 offices.  This provides valuable insight for companies on markets which will be vital in informing a company&rsquo;s internationalisation strategy. </p><p>Indigenous Irish companies are the backbone of the economy and I can assure the Deputy that the officials in my Department are working with all our agencies to monitor the needs of sectors and companies and provide new supports to meet changing company needs, as required. </p><p>The Restart Grant provides direct grant aid to micro and small businesses.  The grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers.  Funding in respect to the Restart Grant is provided by my Department and is administered by the 31 Local Authorities. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland, working with my Department will continue to monitor the needs of sectors and companies as the situation evolves and provide new supports to meet changing company needs, as required.  Indigenous Irish companies are the backbone of the economy and the agency is committed to helping these companies sustain their businesses. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 and will continue to keep the supports provided for enterprise under review. </p></reply>

There are approximately 150,000 ratepayers in the system.  It was necessary therefore to devise criteria that ensured that the most needy businesses would benefit.  Many businesses working from their private residences were in a position to continue trading and would not have the same level of reopening costs that a business that was closed will incur.  Businesses that operate from home and have employees can continue to benefit from the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the full range of supports are available from the Local Enterprise Offices. </p><p>To qualify for a Restart grant, an eligible business:</p><p>- Must have a turnover of less than &euro;5m and have 50 or less employees.</p><p>- Must have suffered a projected 25%+ loss in revenue from 1 April 2020 to 30th June 2020.</p><p>- Must commit to remain open or to reopen if it was closed.</p><p>- Must also declare the intention to retain employees that are benefitting from the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).</p><p>The Restart Grant support is just one part of the wider &euro;12bn package of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs. </p><p>For a full list of supports for business please see .</p></reply>

The new Regulations provide for the unwinding of certain restrictions provided for in the earlier Regulations and also provide for continued restrictions for some business and services.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this regulatory approach to the implementation of the public health framework is to inform a slow, gradual, step-wise and incremental reduction of the current public health social distancing measures, in a risk-based, fair and proportionate way with a view to effectively suppressing the spread of COVID-19 disease while enabling the gradual return of social and economic activity. The Government, informed by the public health advice provided by the Department of Health, has decided to take a gradual re-opening of society and the economy as risks to human health and life caused by COVID-19 remain and lifting the measures in place carries considerable great uncertainty and risk.</p>  <p>  Regulation 7(1) of the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 provides that the occupier, manager, or any other person in charge shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that members of the public are not permitted, or otherwise granted, access to a premises, or to a part of such premises, where a relevant business or service is carried on or otherwise provided. The relevant businesses or services to which this provision applies are listed in Schedule 2 of the regulation. The businesses and services described in Schedule 2 which are not permitted to open at this time include the following:</p>  <p>  Swimming pools, indoor fitness facilities and sports facilities, other than insofar as they are necessary for athletic use and training by persons specified in Regulation 5(4)(a) or the coaching and support personnel of such persons.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Regulation 7(1) is a penal provision for the purposes of section 31A of the Health Act 1947 and provides for penalties of up to a fine of &euro;2,500 or six months&rsquo; imprisonment, or both for breach of the Regulations. </p>  <p>  The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated.

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at .</p><p>The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework described above, it is the Government rather than the Minister or Department of Health that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. The decisions of the Government are published and the guidance in operation at a point in time are available on the Government website at .</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that all pubs, including those that serve food other than drinks, can only re-open when it is permitted to do so. All pubs, including those that serve food other than drinks, are required to be registered with the Health Service Executive in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 852/2004.  All food businesses must also have a food safety management system in place based on the principles of Hazard (Analysis &amp;amp; Critical Control Point (HACCP) to control the risks in their food business. Further information on these and other businesses food safety management systems has been published by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and is available at https://www.fsai.ie/faq/coronavirus.html.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also published guidance for the hospitality sector which is available at </p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team has also requested the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to develop guidance on the application of existing social distancing requirements in specific, defined and controlled environments in the hospitality industry during periods of low incidence of the disease. This guidance will then be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team on completion.  </p><p>In addition, on 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19. </p><p>The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated.

The site provides a comprehensive range of information and supports related to substance use.</p>  <p>  Recently, the HSE launched Know the Score, the first national evidence-based resource on alcohol and drugs for senior cycle students. It aims to engage young people in exploring and considering a wide range of topics related to the risks associated with alcohol and drugs.</p>  <p>  The HSE monitors trends and considers the need for new material in relation to drugs based on national reports through stakeholder networks and recommendations from other countries. Emerging trend content is published through the Drugs.ie website and affiliated social media channels.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health, as part of the introduction of the Health Diversion Programme, is providing &euro;100,000 in 2020 to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use. This will include the use of club drugs, festival drug use and new trends. While this campaign was originally scheduled for the latter part of 2020, this timetable may need to be revised given the draw on resources in dealing with Covid 19.</p>  <p>  Nitrous oxide has been raised by the HSE as an emerging issue at different points this year. The HSE warned young people regarding the danger of using nitrous oxide (sometimes referred to as &lsquo;laughing gas&rsquo;) through a media release in January. New content was added to Drugs.ie outlining the effects and risks associated with nitrous oxide.</p>  <p>  Parents play an important role in educating young people on the risks regarding substance abuse. Evidence based content is available on Drugs.ie regarding nitrous oxide, as well as a HSE booklet providing advice for parents on how to talk to young people about the risks associated with drug and alcohol use.</p>  <p>  We must be especially vigilant in protecting young people from threats to their health and wellbeing from misuse of  substances, including nitrous oxide. I believe that a multi-faceted approach, involving online resources, in-school interventions and targeted awareness campaigns, can minimise the risk of substance misuse among young people.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs</p>  <p>  The HSE advise that the available capacity in private hospitals was primarily used to support the provision of non-COVID related care for time- dependent treatments and procedures to patients, including areas such as cancer and cardiovascular surgeries, transplant surgery, chemotherapy, radiological tests and procedures. The range and type of procedures that can be undertaken has been expanded in line with NPHET guidance.</p>  <p>  The National Office of Clinical Audit (NOCA) Critical Care Information System was extended to Private Providers to support tracking of COVID related cases. The HSE have advised my Department that the data available shows that 7 such cases were admitted to Critical Care in Private Hospitals.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.</p><p>NPHET has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19 care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().</p></reply>

Sharing the Vision comes at a time when Covid-19 has impacted so negatively on the nation&rsquo;s mental health.

Indoor visiting in residential care facilities where there is no ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will be permissible from 15 June in circumstances where certain criteria are followed. During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 within a residential care facility, the guidance advises that all but essential visiting is suspended in the interests of protecting residents, visitors and staff.  This guidance is available on the HPSC&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This will enable children to access information on their donor should they so wish thus enabling them to exercise their rights to know their genetic identity. </p>  <p>  Commencement of Parts 2 and 3 also entitles parents of children born in the State as a result of a donor assisted reproduction procedure performed before the 4th of May to apply to the courts for legal recognition of their parental status, subject to certain conditions.  </p>  <p>  Following commencement, the legislation prohibits the use of non-anonymous gametes in most circumstances, embedding the rights of children to know their genetic heritage in future years.  </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties the global COVID-19 pandemic has presented for donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  It has led to the closure of fertility clinics for several weeks and some individuals and couples have found themselves in a position where they can no longer use gametes they had previously purchased, or import anonymous embryos for use in fertility treatments in the State.  </p>  <p>  However, it is now over 5 years since the Children and Family Relationships Act was enacted and while I had intended to commence Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 last summer I allowed a longer lead time to for people to make arrangements to use gametes that have already been purchased, where appropriate, and to allow a sufficient pool of donors with the appropriate consent to be acquired in advance of commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act of 2015.</p>  <p>  Further delay to the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 would have presented an unfair penalty to those parents who have already waited a substantial period of time to have their rights to parentage vindicated in law and most importantly for the State to vindicate the rights of donor conceived children to information about their identity.   </p></reply>

Of these, 47.6% were linked to outbreaks in Cavan and 67.2% linked to outbreaks in Monaghan. A similar pattern has been identified in the period of 1 May to 4 June although the numbers of confirmed cases have declined significantly.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive have observed that a higher proportion of cases in both Cavan and Monaghan are linked to outbreaks compared with national data. Outbreaks have occurred in a variety of settings including nursing homes, acute hospitals, private homes and workplaces, including meat/poultry factories and mushroom farms. Regional multi-disciplinary outbreak control teams are investigating and managing these outbreaks.</p>  <p>  Although the incidence of COVID-19 cases appears high in Cavan and Monaghan, this needs to be interpreted with caution as incidence rates are sensitive to small changes in case numbers due to the relatively small populations in these counties.</p></reply>

The Government, informed by the public health advice provided by the Department of Health, has decided to take a gradual re-opening of society and the economy as risk to human health and life caused by COVID-19 remain and lifting the measures in place carries considerable great uncertainty and risk.</p><p>Regulation 7(1) of the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 provides that the occupier, manager, or any other person in charge shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that members of the public are not permitted, or otherwise granted, access to a premises &hellip;, or to a part of such premises, where a relevant business or service is carried on or otherwise provided.

The Protocol is available at  </p><p>The protocol is mandatory and it applies to all workplaces across the economy. I am aware that there is significant planning required to move to a new model of operating with the challenges of COVID-19. It is however, the responsibility of employers (and self-employed persons) to apply a risk based approach to returning to work and to prepare to apply the precautions necessary to comply fully with the public health advice. The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is tasked with providing advice and support to employers and employees on what and how COVID-19 measures are applied in the workplace. </p><p>The services described in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions are not matters within the remit of my Department.

The Strategy is evidence based, in line with international norms and was informed by the voices of women from across the country, drawn from the 1,324 responses received during the public consultation process.  Outlined in the Strategy is a new model of care for maternity services with three care pathways - Supported, Assisted and Specialised - ensuring that women receive the right care, from the right professional, at the right time in the right place.  In line with that model of care, pregnant women deemed to be at normal risk will be offered, and encouraged to avail of, care in the Supported Care pathway.  Key to realising this goal is the development and expansion of community midwifery services, as recommended in the Strategy. </p>  <p>  Good progress has been made since the Strategy&rsquo;s publication in 2016, with midwifery led and community-based services increasingly available across the country.  On Friday 5th of June last the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme applied for a drawdown of new development funding which is being provided for maternity services in 2020.  This funding request was approved on 10th June and will facilitate the further development of community midwifery services around the country. The drawdown approval specifically includes funding for an Advanced Midwifery Practitioner in Cavan General Hospital to provide additional senior midwifery expertise and capability and enable the further expansion of community midwifery services in Cavan.</p>  <p>  I was very surprised at media reports of the proposed closure of the Midwifery Led Unit in Cavan as neither I, nor my Department, was advised of any intended change in relation to maternity services at the hospital.  It is clear that any cessation or diminution of midwifery led services is not in line with the recommendations of the Strategy.  Therefore, my Department has requested, and is currently awaiting, a full report from the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) on the situation in Cavan General Hospital.  Assurances have also been sought from the Programme that maternity services within the RCSI Hospital Group are, and will continue to be, developed in line with Government policy.</p>  <p>Once the full report has been received, my Department will work with the NWIHP to ensure that any additional supports which are required to secure the future of community midwifery services in Cavan, will be put in place.  This will ensure that the choice of the Supported Care   pathway remains available to women attending Cavan General Hospital for maternity services.</p>  <p>  With regard to your particular queries in relation to the numbers of women attending the Cavan Midwifery Led Unit, as these are operational issues, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to you directly. </p></reply>

The app will be released when validation testing is complete, and all appropriate approvals are in place. The results of validation testing will inform the go live date.</p>  <p>  Apps are also being developed in many EU countries. Each is tailored to meet the needs of the national public health service and specifically the way in which contact tracing operations has been set up to work. </p>  <p>  DG Sante, DG Connect and other key stakeholders at EU level are leading the way in developing interoperability standards to enable national apps to work in other members states, to support EU citizens as they travel between countries. Ireland is actively engaged in these activities through its membership of the EU eHealth network, which is acting as the forum for these discussions and agreements. Last week, the eHealth network agreed to pilot a solution for interoperability between members states using &lsquo;decentralised&rsquo; contact tracing apps.</p></reply>

The current advice is that you should follow social distancing guidance everywhere outside the home, including keeping a physical distance of 2 metres apart. It is also recommended that face coverings be worn in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as shops, and on public transport, or when meeting someone who is vulnerable to the virus, for example people who are cocooning. The recommendation applies to those people aged over 13 who can tolerate them. </p>  <p>  This advice is kept under review by the National Public Health Emergency Team on a continuing basis. Arising from their meeting of 4 June, 2020, the National Public Health Emergency Team has requested that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre develop guidance on the application of existing social distancing requirements in specific, defined and controlled environments in the hospitality industry during periods of low incidence of the disease. This guidance will then be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team on completion.</p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  "League tables" comparing speed of reimbursement in Ireland with that of other countries are often misleading as several countries have quite different and often less rigorous assessment arrangements than Ireland. Furthermore, many of the newer products being licensed are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. </p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019, the HSE approved 31 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).  Application 1 was for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. This indication was approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis.</p>  <p>  Application 2 is for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.</p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/Cannabidiol, THC/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 12 August 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.</p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars.</p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p>  <p>  In a further effort to identify solutions to the challenges which we face, I proposed a dialogue with Industry to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  An Open Policy Forum took place in 2018 between the Department of Health, the Department of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Irish Healthcare Pharmaceutical Association (IPHA) and an Open Dialogue meeting took place in 2019 between the Department of Health, the HSE and IPHA in relation to new medicines.</p></reply>

This programme will see GPs identifying patients with one or more of four chronic conditions &ndash; Type 2 Diabetes, Asthma, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and Cardiovascular disease &ndash; to participate in the programme. </p>  <p>  When fully implemented, it is planned that over 400,000 patients with an existing diagnosis of one of the specified conditions, those who are assessed by their GP on an opportunistic case finding basis, as well as those identified as high risk, will benefit under the programme.</p>  <p>  The roll-out of the CDM programme commenced earlier this year to medical card and GP visit card holders aged 75 years and older, with additional groups of patients to be identified in the next three years.  Full roll-out is expected in 2023. This programme is a structured approach to the management of chronic diseases in the context of general practice designed to help patients to manage their conditions and delivering better quality of life and a reduced reliance on hospital attendance.</p>  <p>  Patients on the structured CDM programme will receive two annual visits with their GP and two visits with the practice nurse while those patients on the high-risk preventative programme will receive 1 GP visit and 1 practice nurse visit a year. The annual scheduled reviews include patient education, preventative care, past medical history, physical examination (including blood pressure) and scheduled investigations.  </p>  <p>  Patients holding a medical or a GP visit card can receive check-ups for hypertension without charges, and the costs associated with such check-ups would be covered by the capitation payments made to GPs on the patients&rsquo; behalf.  There are no plans at present to introduce free check-ups for hypertension to the general population and so there are no costings available for the introduction of this measure.</p></reply>

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020.

Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at http://www.gov.ie/phase2. </p>  <p>  The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI No. 206 of 2020) which came into operation from 8 June 2020 until 29 June 2020, allows for groups of up to 15 people who are not from the same household to meet outdoors for social, recreational and exercise activities. </p>  <p>  These regulations also stipulate that no more than 6 people who are not from the same household may meet indoors. These meetings should be kept as short as possible and last no more than an hour. Indoor meetings should be in a well-ventilated room where possible and follow social distancing guidelines. </p>  <p>  Activities involving children such as summer camps, should include no more than 12 children, to allow for 3 supervisors to be present to supervise the activity and to make sure that public health guidance is being followed. </p>  <p>  It is recommended also that supervisors and children should keep to the same groups of 15 or less for these activities. This will help limit contacts should a member of the group become COVID-19 positive. A log should be kept of everyone involved in these activities for contact tracing purposes. </p>  <p>  Children should continue to practice social distancing, not share equipment with other children and wash their hands regularly and properly and follow good hygiene when coughing and sneezing. It is advisable generally to limit the number of people the children meet with, as the greater the contact, the greater the risk getting and spreading the virus.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, you should not travel beyond your county, or 20 kilometres from where you live if crossing county boundaries, to participate in any social, recreational and exercise activities. </p>  <p>  The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated. Work is underway to consider how best to achieve this aim and more information will be made available in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Government, informed by the public health advice provided by the Department of Health, has decided to take a gradual re-opening of society and the economy as risks to human health and life caused by COVID-19 remain and lifting the measures in place carries considerable great uncertainty and risk.</p><p>The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated.

However, it is essential, as with any skill, that competency is maintained through regular practice and education.   Administration of Intravenous fluids or medication by nursing staff in any care setting is governed by local policy and should take account of the frequency any such therapy will require. The model of care is determined by the relevant National Clinical Programme. </p>  <p>  Any patient or nursing home resident requiring IV fluid therapy is acutely unwell and will require other nursing care to support their illness. This care will require education and support as it is in addition to normal care requirements.  </p>  <p>  A Community Intervention Team (CIT) is a specialist, health professional team that provides a rapid and integrated response to a patient with an acute episode of illness who requires enhanced services/acute intervention for a defined short period of time. This may be provided at home, in a residential setting or in the community as deemed appropriate, thereby avoiding acute hospital attendance or admission, or facilitating early discharge.  </p>  <p>  One of the services includes administration of IV Antibiotic - via the Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy Program (OPAT). The OPAT national standards require that an infection specialist (Infectious disease/ Clinical Microbiologist) is consulted on the appropriateness of a prescription for IV antibiotics, the dose and duration, in order to ensure antimicrobial stewardship. CIT or OPAT nurses are available to facilitate a referral from the emergency department to avoid hospital admission, or from hospitals wards to facilitate early discharge and return to the person&rsquo;s place of residence for the course of their IV antibiotics.  A pathway is in place for GPs to refer appropriate patients directly for IV antibiotics for cellulitis.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that on foot of a National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendation, on 23 May a COVID-19 Expert Panel on Nursing Homes was established, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Panel is to examine the national and international responses to the COVID-19 crisis, and to examine the emerging best practice. The main objective of the Panel is to provide immediate real-time learnings and recommendations in light of the expected ongoing impact of COVID-19 over the next 12-18 months.  COVID-19 is a new disease, which can present atypically in the frail elderly, and new evidence and best practice in its management are constantly emerging.</p></reply>

For example:</p>  <p>  - A high-level Steering Group was established to assist my Department in its development of the policy and has held 7 meetings to date, most recently, by tele-conference, on Friday 12 June. Updates and related papers such as discussion papers on the policy content are published regularly on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  - Focus group consultation research was undertaken between November 2019 and March 2020 by the Institute of Public Health on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, to ensure that the voices of the most directly affected service users are heard.  The Institute&rsquo;s final report to the Department on the focus group research is scheduled for completion later this Summer.  </p>  <p>  - A commissioned independent research evidence project to inform the policy is in the final stages of completion.  </p>  <p>  Related major developments in relation to other adult safeguarding policy developments within the health and social care sector include:</p>  <p>  - My approval in September 2019, and subsequent publication, of National Standards for Adult Safeguarding prepared and submitted to me jointly by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission.</p>  <p>  - The anticipated finalisation of a major revision by the Health Service Executive of its national operational HSE adult safeguarding policy.  </p>  <p>  These initiatives, together with the Department&rsquo;s development of the national health sector policy and underpinning legislation, should ensure the continued evolution and improvement, within the Irish health and social care sector, of the safeguarding of adults who may be at risk of abuse and harm.  </p>  <p>  A further significant initiative in relation to adult safeguarding (relevant to all sectors and Departments, including the health and social care sector and my Department) was the Law Reform Commission's commencement in June 2019 of a legal research project on "A Regulatory Framework for Adult Safeguarding", on foot of submissions from various bodies, including from my Department. I understand that this work is progressing having regard to a recent consultation process. </p>  <p>  I have previously emphasised the importance of developing a clear, coherent, carefully-considered and implementable policy framework as a basis for any required underpinning legislation.  The Department's approach therefore has been to undertake the required detailed policy and evidence base development work including appropriate research, public and stakeholder consultation and resource implications analyses.</p></reply>

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at http://www.gov.ie/phase2.  </p><p>The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria: </p><p>1. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease, </p><p>2. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>3. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>4. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>5. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework described above, it is the Government rather than the Minister or Department of Health that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. The decisions of the Government are published and the guidance in operation at a point in time are available on the Government website at </p><p>The purpose of this public health framework approach is to inform a slow, gradual, step-wise and incremental reduction of the current public health social distancing measures, in a risk-based, fair and proportionate way with a view to effectively suppressing the spread of COVID-19 disease while enabling the gradual return of social and economic activity.</p><p>The services described in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is not a matter within the remit of my Department. Guidance in relation to specific sectors of the economy should in the first instance be sought from the Government Department with responsibility for that sector.  </p><p>However, the Deputy may wish to note that Regulation 7(1) of the newly introduced Health Act 1947 (Section 31 A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 2) Regulations 2020  provides that the occupier, manager, or any other person in charge shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that members of the public are not permitted, or otherwise granted, access to a premises, or to a part of such premises, where a relevant business or service is carried on or otherwise provided. The relevant businesses or services to which this provision applies are listed in Schedule 2 of the regulation and includes cinemas, other than outdoor cinemas at which persons attending a screening do so in motor vehicles and remain in the vehicles without exiting the motor vehicles for the duration of such attendance.</p><p>The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated. Work is underway to consider how best to achieve this aim and more information will be made available in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

NSS Director of Public Health, Dr Caroline Mason Mohan, is NSS clinical representative on the HSE steering group which is ensuring a coordinated approach to the resumption of non-COVID related health services.  </p>  <p>  I am aware the correspondence the Deputy is referring to which has been received in my office. The resumption of screening is a priority for the NSS, it requires very careful planning to ensure that our population screening services can be delivered in a safe way.  Screening will be re-introduced on a phased basis, with invitations for screening issued according to clinical prioritisation and taking the screening and treatment pathways into account.  It is expected that restart dates for population screening will be announced by the end of June.</p></reply>

The Government also announced that Ms. Justice Mary Irvine would be appointed as Chairperson of the Tribunal.</p>  <p>  The legislation necessary to establish the CervicalCheck Tribunal, the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019, passed through the Oireachtas and was signed into law by the President on 23 July 2019. The legislation sets out the functions of the Tribunal, which include hearing and determining claims in respect of CervicalCheck outside of the court process and facilitating Restoration of Trust Meetings.</p>  <p>  For the Tribunal to begin carrying out its functions, Section 4 of the Act requires that &lsquo;The Minister shall, by order, appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of this Act.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  Since the passage of the legislation through the Oireachtas, Department officials have been working with Tribunal Chairperson making the administrative arrangements required to establish the CervicalCheck Tribunal.</p>  <p>  As the key administrative arrangements were in place, it was intended that the CervicalCheck Tribunal would be established by the end of March 2020. However, due to the outbreak of Covid-19, in line with the public health measures being taken to control the outbreak of the virus it was decided to delay the establishment of the Tribunal. Of particular concern in establishing the Tribunal is that the claimants are in a group considered to be particularly at risk if they were to contract the virus.</p>  <p>  As the restrictions are now being eased and arrangements are being put in place in the Tribunal to ensure it can operate as safely as possible, it is expected that the Tribunal will be established shortly. It is intended that the Tribunal&rsquo;s function in respect of hearing and determining claims will be commenced initially and its function in respect of Restoration of Trust Meetings will be commenced at a later stage.</p>  <p>  Once a date for the establishment of the Tribunal has been decided, it will be announced on the Tribunal website www.cervicalchecktribunal.ie and will communicated directly to the relevant parties.</p></reply>

Key to effective contact tracing is the capacity to get quick and comprehensive notification to all close contacts of people infected with Covid-19. The Covid Tracker app has been developed to complement our current arrangements and help improve the speed and comprehensiveness of contact tracing.  It is core to the purposes of the app that it be as accessible as possible to the whole population (aged 16 and over).</p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the app is to enable the health services to improve the speed and effectiveness of contact tracing. Use of the app will provide for more comprehensive alerting of close contacts of those that have become infected than is currently possible based on interviews of those infected and memory recall. In addition, the app permits citizens to anonymously report symptoms in real-time. The purpose of the symptom tracker is to assist the health services in mapping, predicting and ultimately preventing the spread of Covid-19. The app will also provide direct access to authoritative news, the purpose of which is to ensure that information and up-to-date guidance in relation to Covid-19 is accessible. </p>  <p>  The development team has engaged with the National Council for the Blind Ireland (NCBI) and contracted them to carry out an assessment of the app for those with visual impairments. The team are addressing issues arising from that assessment and in order of priority, so that version 1 of the app will be functional for use by those with visual and physical challenges.

The current advice is that you should follow social distancing guidance everywhere outside the home, including keeping a physical distance of 2 metres apart. It is also recommended that face coverings be worn in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as shops, and on public transport, or when meeting someone who is vulnerable to the virus, for example people who are cocooning. The recommendation applies to those people aged over 13 who can tolerate them. </p>  <p>  This advice is kept under review by the National Public Health Emergency Team on a continuing basis. Arising from their meeting of 4 June, 2020, the National Public Health Emergency Team has requested that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre develop guidance on the application of existing social distancing requirements in specific, defined and controlled environments in the hospitality industry during periods of low incidence of the disease. This guidance will then be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team on completion.</p></reply>

Contact tracing operations are at the centre of the health service response to Covid-19 and protecting our communities in the phases ahead. Key to effective contact tracing is the capacity to get quick and comprehensive notification to all close contacts of people infected with Covid-19. The Covid Tracker app has been developed to complement our current arrangements and help improve the speed and comprehensiveness of contact tracing. The app has other features also such as the daily symptom check-in, and information provision.</p><p>The contact tracing app that has been developed for Ireland is very much aligned with the advices and guidance issued by the EU Commission, the OECD and the WHO.  The European Centre for Disease Control recently stated that &quot;the use of mobile contact tracing apps for contact tracing offers several benefits: </p><p>- they do not rely on the memory of the case (who may be very ill at the time of interview); </p><p>- they allow contacts unknown to the case to be traced (e.g. passengers who sat close on a train); </p><p>- they can potentially speed up the process; </p><p>- they may facilitate further follow-up of contacts by health authorities via a messaging system. A symptom-checker feature could facilitate this, although it is not essential.&quot; </p><p>[Source: <i></i>] </p><p>The primary purpose of the app is to enable the health services to improve the speed and effectiveness of contact tracing. Use of the app will provide for more comprehensive alerting of close contacts of those that have become infected than is currently possible based on interviews of those infected and memory recall. In addition, the app permits citizens to anonymously report symptoms in real-time. The purpose of the symptom tracker is to assist the health services in mapping, predicting and ultimately preventing the spread of Covid-19. The app will also provide direct access to authoritative news, the purpose of which is to ensure that information and up-to-date guidance in relation to Covid-19 is accessible. </p><p>App development is now complete and the HSE and my Department are finalising arrangements particularly focussed on embedding and aligning the app within the national testing and contact tracing service. The Department of Health and the HSE have completed a programme of research to support the development of the app. The findings have provided valuable insights from the Irish public and they have informed the development of the app. My Department and HSE have worked with support from across the public service and in partnership with leading scientists through SFI. Ireland is working actively within the EU and is one of a large number of countries planning to roll out this new technology. </p><p>The app will operate on a voluntary and fully opt-in basis.  The app will be launched once the necessary final approvals have been received from HSE, Department of Health, and Government.</p></reply>

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at: <i></i></p><p>The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria: </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,  </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and well-being etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework described above, it is the Government rather than the Minister or Department of Health that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. The decisions of the Government are published and the guidance in operation at a point in time are available on the Government website at: <i></i></p><p>While full church services are not currently permitted, funeral services are allowed to take place. From the start of Phase 2 (8 June, 2020) up to 25 people can be in attendance at a funeral service and burial / cremation ceremonies while observing strict social distancing guidance such as keeping 2 metres apart, maintaining hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, as well as the wearing of face coverings. </p><p>Funeral Directors and officiators are requested to remind and encourage mourners to comply with public health guidance for the safety of all attending a funeral.</p><p>It is also important to note that any indoor events after a funeral must comply with the public health guidance applicable to indoor visits, that is limited to a maximum of 6 persons indoors.</p><p>The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated. Work is underway to consider how best to achieve this aim and more information will be made available in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

However priority service users have been identified in each CHO, and individualised supports continue to be provided to many people in alternative models particularly for these individuals with higher support needs, through alternative means such as via online support and/or regular telephone contact with families. Health and social care responses to the current public health emergency are under continuing review, including specific measures such as these to support vulnerable people.  </p><p>The resumption of adult day services is currently being considered by my Department and the HSE as part of broader planning to prepare for the resumption of non-COVID-19 community and social care services in the current environment, and in line with public health guidance. My Department and the HSE has established a Joint Working Group to develop a plan for Community Capacity. </p><p>The HSE is finalising plans to re-establish vital non-covid supports and services. This includes very careful and detailed work on the part of the Disability Sector with national guidance and will result in directing how all funded agencies can deliver services on a medium to long-term basis. Community Healthcare Organisations and Section 38/39 agencies continue to work together at a regional level in order to plan and co-ordinate efforts. Considering the very serious nature of this pandemic and the vulnerability of people with disabilities as a care group, any plans to safely commence all disability services and supports must comply with guidance developed by the National Public Surveillance Centre  in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE has now developed a number of important guidance documents to assist disability services: the Framework for Resumption of Adult Day Services and Reshaping Disability Services From 2020 &amp;amp; Beyond. The HSE and disability service providers, where identified, will continue to communicate with school leavers and their families to plan and organise for a transition to day services in line with public health guidance. </p><p>These documents are available at the website linked below.  </p></reply>

Sharing the Vision comes at a time when Covid-19 has impacted so negatively on the nation&rsquo;s mental health. It advocates protecting health and wellbeing, getting appropriate care quickly and seeks that services provided are quality assured and safe. </p></reply>

However, the reliability of serological tests remains a major issue as does the interpretation of what immunity means and how long it might last. These remain active research questions.</p>  <p>  The ECDC have reported that over 60 rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have been CE marked to date, and many more continue to be placed on the market. Prior to the introduction of new serological assays [antibody tests] clinical validation studies are required to confirm that test performance can be replicated in the context in which the test is intended to be used.</p>  <p>  Following a request from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) the HSE and Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) are proceeding with plans to undertake a national population sero-prevalence study. This work is being carried out jointly by HPSC and NVRL, in collaboration with the Central Statistics Office and Department of Health.</p>  <p>  This first use of antibody testing, as has occurred in other countries, will be to estimate the prevalence of immunity in the general population by conducting a population based sero-prevalence survey to measure the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus in a representative  sample of the Irish population in two geographically defined areas. Ethics approval for the study was granted by the National Research Ethics Committee for COVID-19 on 4 June. All persons aged 12-69 years living in Ireland can be randomly selected to participate. Those randomly selected, who consent to participate, will complete a questionnaire and have a blood sample taken.</p>  <p>  Samples will be analysed at the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) for the detection of antibodies to the virus. For those who do not speak English, arrangements will be in place to enable them to participate via translated material and interpreters. Those who need assistance to support decision making will be provided with these supports, on request. The study will commence on 15 June, with results being available toward the end of August.</p></reply>

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at http://www.gov.ie/phase2. </p><p>The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>- The latest data regarding the progression of the disease, </p><p>- The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>- The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>- The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>- An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework described above, it is the Government rather than the Minister or Department of Health that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. The decisions of the Government are published and the guidance in operation at a point in time are available on the Government website at </p><p>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI No. 206 of 2020) signed by me, which came into operation on 8 June 2020 until 29 June 2020. The new Regulations provide for the unwinding of certain restrictions provided for in the earlier Regulations and also provide for continued restrictions for some business and services.</p><p>The services mentioned by the Deputy are addressed within the Regulations. The purpose of this regulatory approach to the implementation of the public health framework is to inform a slow, gradual, step-wise and incremental reduction of the current public health social distancing measures, in a risk-based, fair and proportionate way with a view to effectively suppressing the spread of COVID-19 disease while enabling the gradual return of social and economic activity. The Government, informed by the public health advice provided by the Department of Health, has decided to take a gradual re-opening of society and the economy as risks to human health and life caused by COVID-19 remain and lifting the measures in place carries considerable great uncertainty and risk.</p><p>The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated. Work is underway to consider how best to achieve this aim and more information will be made available in the coming weeks. This work, once completed will form part of the Government's considerations.</p></reply>

The Registration Board was duly appointed in February 2019 and held its inaugural meeting in May 2019. </p>  <p>  While the Board has begun working towards regulation of these professions, a substantial body of work requires to be undertaken before a register may be opened.  The work of this Board is significantly more challenging than for registration boards for some of the more established professions, owing to the different and complexity of entry paths into the counsellor and psychotherapist professions, variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers.  In order to support this and other important work being undertaken by CORU, my Department has allocated additional funding of over &euro;900,000 to the regulator in 2020. </p></reply>

In recognition of this, the Government has mobilised key cross-Government and cross-sectoral partners to develop a mental wellbeing campaign.</p>  <p>  The campaign is a whole-of-population approach to supporting healthcare staff and the public, through health and wellbeing advice, resilience-based training and free online interventions such as counselling and crisis texting for all in need.  In addition, the HSE&rsquo;s online mental health services have been providing remote access to supports during the Covid-19 outbreak and will continue to be available in the post-Covid phase.</p>  <p>  There is  concern globally that the Covid-19 pandemic may increase suicide rates.  High-quality evidence is needed to guide both national and international responses to the pandemic.  The HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) is working with partners to address suicide prevention during and after Covid-19.  NOSP and the National Suicide Research Foundation have been working with colleagues in Scotland undertaking a literature review on public health emergencies and suicidal behaviour, in order to provide the HSE with research-based intelligence about the likely impact of the current Covid-19 pandemic on suicidal behaviour.</p></reply>

However, I can set out the regulatory and ethical processes that apply in relation to carrying out health research in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Persons are free to carry out health research as long as it complies with the law and applicable ethical requirements.  That means that, in practice, all health research in Ireland has to be ethically approved by research ethics committees.  Those committees are composed of expert and lay members to ensure a wide-ranging societal and scientific perspective is applied to consideration of the research.  Some health research involves collaboration between hospitals, academic institutions and commercial companies.  That collaboration is predicated on the view that each participating partner brings a distinct value to the research.  If hospitals or academic institutions wish to collaborate with a commercial company that is their decision and there is an individual and collective responsibility on all parties to ensure compliance with all legal and ethical requirements. </p>  <p>  Opt-in consent is the default requirement under the Health Research Regulations made by the Minister.  It is important to note that without those Regulations there would be uncertainty about whether and in what circumstances consent would be required.  That uncertainty would be unhelpful for protecting individuals and their health and genetic data.  Accordingly, the Regulations provide clarity, certainty and consistency on the range of safeguards that apply when it is intended to collect, use or disclose an individual&rsquo;s personal data for health research. </p>  <p>  Consistent with the approach in other jurisdictions, the Regulations provide for a clearly defined and limited statutory consent declaration process.  The process, which emerged after extensive engagement with the Data Protection Commission, enables a data controller proposing to carry out health research using personal data to apply for a consent declaration which means that the consent of the individual is not required for the obtaining and use of his or her personal information for the health research concerned.  To be successful, the applicant must be able to demonstrate to the independent Health Research Consent Declaration Committee or Appeal Panel that the public interest in carrying out the health research significantly outweighs the public interest in requiring the explicit consent of the data subject, that it would not be feasible to obtain such consent and that the applicant is willing to ensure a wide range of specified safeguards will be put in place, including carrying out a full Data Protection Impact Assessment, securing ethical approval from a research ethics committee and having a lawful basis for carrying out the research. </p>  <p>  As a further safeguard, the Regulations contain an express provision stating that there will be no disclosure of the personal data obtained by a person with a consent declaration unless that disclosure is required by law or the data subject has given his or her explicit consent to the disclosure.  That provision is purposely designed to stop data controllers who obtain a consent declaration from revealing, including by way of selling, any personal data they have obtained as a result of the declaration. </p>  <p>  I am informed that, in the particular study referred to in the questions, the Health Research Consent Declaration Committee did not approve the application made but the independent Appeal Panel on the basis of the evidence put before it (which included additional evidence) did agree to issue a declaration subject to the a number of strict requirements.  In recognising that requiring informed consent on an opt-in basis was not feasible, it took the decision that one of the safeguards should be an opt-out mechanism and it required a publicity campaign to help reach the widest audience. </p>  <p>  While I have no role in decisions of independent statutory bodies I did express the view in the Dail last Thursday that an extension should be granted to the opt-out period in light of the exceptional covid-19 circumstances.  I am pleased to note that Beaumont have agreed to extend the timeframe by three months until 14 September.  Finally, under data protection law, decisions on compliance and matters of enforcement lie with the Data Protection Commission.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services.  A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it.  Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need.  Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients.</p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June.  It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics.  This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.  This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET.  The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual. </p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists. </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics.  This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.  This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March.  The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand.  My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at </p><p>The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,  </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e.  An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework described above, it is the Government rather than the Minister or Department of Health that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.  The decisions of the Government are published and the guidance in operation at a point in time are available on the Government website at </p><p>The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated.  Work is underway to consider how best to achieve this aim and more information will be made available in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The current advice is that you should follow social distancing guidance everywhere outside the home, including keeping a physical distance of 2 metres apart.  It is also recommended that face coverings be worn in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as shops, and on public transport, or when meeting someone who is vulnerable to the virus, for example people who are cocooning.  The recommendation applies to those people aged over 13 who can tolerate them.</p>  <p>  This advice is kept under review by the National Public Health Emergency Team on a continuing basis.  Arising from their meeting of 4 June, 2020, the National Public Health Emergency Team has requested that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre develop guidance on the application of existing social distancing requirements in specific, defined and controlled environments in the hospitality industry during periods of low incidence of the disease.  This guidance will then be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team on completion.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that on 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published.  It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.  The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department.  It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists. </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at http://www.gov.ie/phase2.  </p><p>The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria: </p><p>The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,  </p><p>The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework described above, it is the Government rather than the Minister or Department of Health that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. The decisions of the Government are published and the guidance in operation at a point in time are available on the Government website at </p><p>The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated. This obviously includes consideration of the public health advice that will apply to services such as those described in the question. Work is underway to consider how best to achieve these aims and more information will be made available in the coming weeks. This work, once completed will form part of the Government's considerations.</p></reply>

Both instruments are inextricably linked and when considered together, represent a significant advance compared to the Commission&rsquo;s original MFF proposal in May 2018.</p>  <p>  Under the 2014-2020 MFF, the total amount allocated to the 28 EU Member States under the CAP, in current prices, was &euro;404 billion (&euro;302.8 billion for the EAGF and &euro;101.2 billion for the EAFRD). Adjusted to reflect the departure of the UK from the EU, the corresponding figure for the EU27 was &euro;375.4 billion (&euro;280.3 billion for the EAGF and &euro;95.1 billion for the EAFRD). The amount originally allocated to Ireland in that period was &euro;10.680 billion - &euro;8.49 billion for the EAGF and &euro;2.19 billion for the EAFRD.</p>  <p>  In May 2018, the EU Commission proposed an allocation of &euro;365 billion, in current prices, for CAP in the period 2021-2027.  This equates to &euro;286.2 billion for the EAGF and &euro;78.8 billion for the EAFRD.  </p>  <p>  The revised MFF proposal for the CAP, presented in May 2020, brings funding levels to some &euro;375 billion, in current prices. A further allocation of &euro;16.5 billion to EAFRD spending from the new Next Generation EU fund brings the total allocation to &euro;391.5 billion for the period 2021-2027 - &euro;290 billion for Pillar I and &euro;101 billion for Pillar II.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the latest budgetary proposals have been set out only at the overall EU-27 level, with the breakdown for Member State allocations not yet clear.</p>  <p>  The latest proposals from the Commission also set out a reinforced Just Transition Fund, with substantial additional funding of &euro;30 billion being added, bringing the total amount to &euro;40 billion.  This funding is intended to alleviate the socio-economic impacts of the transition towards climate neutrality in the most affected regions, and forms part of the EU&rsquo;s overall Green Deal.  Details of the new proposals are still being examined, but the current understanding is that the European agriculture sector will not benefit from funding under the Just Transition Fund.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to thoroughly analyse the proposals so that we can fully understand the precise implications for our agri-food sector.</p></reply>

The European Parliament is also discussing the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a Regulation and is in the process of preparing its own recommended amendments to the text. When both the Council and the Parliament have formally adopted their positions, trilateral negotiations will commence involving the EU Council, the European Parliament and the Commission. </p>  <p>  I am supportive of many of the proposed changes in the Commission proposal that strengthens the EU arrangements for control, inspection and enforcement.   I am also seeking that measures introduced are proportionate, support simplification, cost efficiency and reducing administrative burden for Member States and industry.   </p>  <p>  My Department has been engaged fully in the negotiation process and continues to be actively involved in the ongoing discussion with the Presidency, other Member States and the Commission on the new proposals.</p>  <p>  Regarding Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM), Ireland is supportive of the introduction of a risk-based REM system.  As a Coastal Member State, we are seeking access to the data gathered within this system on a near real time basis to support the work of the Naval Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  I consider that this is a critically important tool given the control obligations that Ireland has in respect of all vessels operating in our 200 mile zone.  In that regard, over the period 2011 to 2015, average landings of all species from the Irish EEZ amounted to just under 387,000 tonnes with an approximate value of &euro;444 million.  Ireland accounted for 42% of those landings by weight followed by the UK (16%), the Netherlands (15%), France (10%) and Spain (7%).  By value, Ireland accounts for 36% of the average value of landings from the Irish EEZ followed by France (18%), the UK (16%), Spain (15%) and the Netherlands (8%).  Responsibility for the control of all fishing activity in Ireland's 200 miles zone rests with the control authorities, the Naval Service and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.   </p>  <p>  The next meeting of the Council of EU Fisheries Ministers will take place on 29 June.  The Presidency had indicated that it would bring a partial general approach on specified Articles in the proposal to this Council meeting.  However, the Presidency has now clarified that it will not seek a general approach but will present a progress report to Member States. Work on the proposal will continue under Germany&rsquo;s presidency in the second half of this year.  My Department has consulted with stakeholders during this process and will continue to keep them apprised of developments.</p></reply>

On 22 May, confirmatory tests carried out at my Department&rsquo;s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory verified the suspect case as one of Atypical BSE.  Atypical BSE is believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate and has only been identified in older cattle.  There is no public health risk associated with this occurrence.  </p>  <p>  The OIE has determined that the incidence of Atypical BSE is not considered in determining a country&rsquo;s BSE risk status. Hence, the discovery of this case has no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s 'controlled risk' status which has been in place since 2008. This classification recognises that Ireland&rsquo;s BSE controls are effective and that, under OIE rules, Irish beef can be safely traded internationally.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, on a temporary basis and in line with the specific protocol agreed with the Chinese authorities, Ireland voluntarily suspended beef exports to China from 22 May, until the epidemiological report on this case has been considered by the Chinese authorities. </p>  <p>  The epidemiological report in this case has been forwarded to the Embassy of Ireland Beijing for onward transmission to the Chinese authorities.  Our Embassy is liaising closely with relevant Chinese officials with a view to seeking an early resumption of the beef trade to China. The decision to resume trade is a matter for the Chinese authorities.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible at present to estimate what potential losses, if any, might result from the temporary suspension of the beef trade with China. The available data shows that beef exports to China have grown significantly in the short time that the market has been open. According to the latest CSO data, almost 8,200 tonnes of Irish beef worth approximately &euro;40m were shipped in 2019, the first full year the market was open. Shipments in the first quarter of 2020 amounted to some 2,200 tonnes and were worth approximately &euro;11m.</p></reply>

Participation had decreased by over 50% in the eight years preceding the 2017/18 school year.</p>  <p>  As a result, my Department commissioned research in April 2018 to identify the barriers to the uptake of the School Milk Scheme. The research identified a number of reasons for the decrease in participation levels, including an increase in water consumption, price perceived as too expensive, parental contribution required for non-DEIS schools and that children do not consume milk at home.  The research also highlighted some issues regarding school facilities and equipment, including the frequency of delivery, particularly in rural areas. </p>  <p>  In light of the findings, my Department has undertaken a number of actions to deliver an improved School Milk Scheme over the last two school years including:</p>  <p>  - Targeted recruitment campaign in advance of the commencement of the new school year by the  National Dairy Council (NDC) ). </p>  <p>  - Enhanced accompanying measures/educational resources in the form of a new School Milk Week delivered, with associated publicity campaigns and competitions to raise awareness.  </p>  <p>  - Increasing the parental subsidy to make the scheme more affordable for parents.</p>  <p>  - Trialling of a new method of delivery of milk to schools. </p>  <p>  I would anticipate that these targeted measures will result in increased participation numbers over the lifetime of the current six year strategy.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department also has responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of North Harbour at Cape Clear, as well as the maintenance of a small number of specific piers, lights and beacons throughout Ireland, in accordance with the Marine Works (Ireland) Act 1902, and piers, lights and beacons constructed under the auspices of the Congested Districts Board.</p>  <p>  As indicated, my legislative remit does not extend to Greencastle Harbour, and given that the ownership of, and overall responsibility for Greencastle Harbour rests with the County Council, it is the Council who will decide if it wishes to carry out any further development, repair or maintenance of Greencastle Harbour. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with Donegal County Council and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, co-funded phase one of a larger Greencastle Harbour development programme up to 2011, which involved the construction of a rock breakwater. </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;8.35m was provided by my Department for this project between the years 2006 &ndash; 2010.

This process will include the involvement of Irish experts and will commence in the second half of 2021. EFSA will send its conclusions to the European Commission, who will make a proposal on whether or not to reapprove glyphosate. Member State representatives on the EU regulatory committee dealing with pesticides legislation will vote on the Commission proposal and must reach a decision before the current approval of glyphosate expires on 15 December 2022.</p>  <p>  As the renewal process is an EU process with formal public consultation, no separate national consultations are envisaged.</p></reply>

It provides funding of &euro;300 million over the six year programme and addresses widely acknowledged weaknesses in the maternal genetics of the Irish suckler herd, makes a positive contribution to farmer profitability and reduces the greenhouse gas intensity of Ireland&rsquo;s beef production. </p><p>There are currently some 24,000 participants in BDGP and it provides for annual payments to participating farmers for completion of defined actions as set out in the Terms and Conditions of the scheme.  Where these actions are not completed, penalties will be applied. </p><p>Some of these actions attract an increased penalty rate in certain years. In 2018, a major requirement under BDGP was for the number of replacement heifers rated at 4 or 5 stars to be a minimum of 20% of the herd's reference figure. For 2019, the requirement was for participating farms to have either a 4 or 5 star stock bull or use 80% 4 or 5 star AI on the holding. In both instances, my Department either directly or in conjunction with ICBF, identified and engaged with farmers falling short of these requirements to  assist them in achieving compliance with the scheme. In both years, I arranged for flexibility in my Department's approach to these requirements to assist farmers in meeting their obligations, a flexibility that is similarly being applied this year where the replacement 4/5 star replacement Heifer requirement is 50% of the reference figure.  All BDGP participants who were identified as having difficulty in meeting this requirement were written to this year to advise them of what options were available to them to avoid a penalty.</p><p>The total amounts deducted from BDGP payments as a result of penalties recorded in 2017, 2018 and 2019 are detailed as follows.  <table>    <tr>       <th>2017</th>       <th>&euro;920,367</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;1,186,912</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;1,868,226</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

A copy of this paper is available at www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/consultations/Pages/Public-Consultation-on-the-Proposed-Introduction-of-new-Environmental-Levies.aspx.      </p>  <p>  The proposals, which include a coffee cup levy, a waste recovery levy, and increases to the existing plastic bag and landfill levies are aimed at encouraging positive environmental behavioural change and climate action. With the focus on behavioural change, only preliminary scoping was carried out on potential revenue from the proposed Phase 1 levies. In this regard, it is estimated that revenue in the range of &euro;8m to &euro;9.5m per annum would be generated from a waste recovery levy, and from the increases to the landfill and plastic bag levies. In relation to a coffee cup levy, it is not possible at this time to produce a reliable estimate of potential revenue as defining the scale of disposable cup use is challenging with no single robust and authoritative source of data.</p>  <p>  Work is currently on-going on the further development of these proposals, including having regard to the submissions received via the consultation process.</p></reply>

That is why we have worked to introduce a wide programme of Government supports for impacted businesses.  The range of supports available includes new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example. </p>  <p>  Minister Griffin and I have also appointed a Tourism Recovery Taskforce to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.

Indeed I would like to acknowledge and thank the Airport for its commitment to keeping the airport open and for keeping passengers and staff safe during this difficult time.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately Shannon Airport is not alone in the challenges it faces, as the entire aviation industry is one of the industries most affected by the global pandemic.  It was for this reason that I established a taskforce to spearhead the rehabilitation of the aviation industry.  The Aviation Taskforce is charged with advising on a framework for promoting the return of aviation connectivity and aviation enterprises that are critical to supporting the wider economic recovery.  It will prepare an Aviation Recovery Action Plan setting out recommendations for consideration by Government as appropriate. The Action Plan should be concluded and submitted by July 10th.  </p>  <p>  Also, the Deputies may be aware that Minister of State Brendan Griffin and I recently established a Tourism Recovery Taskforce that will prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan.  The Plan will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. It will also identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023. </p>  <p>  Increasing air and sea access to the regions will be an important element of recovery in the tourism sector. Tourism Ireland has been working for many years to drive demand for routes to the regions, and in particular Shannon Airport, through co-operative marketing campaigns in conjunction with the airport, the airlines and other partners. Through the Regional Co-operative Market Access Scheme, &euro;2.5 million has been made available to Tourism Ireland in 2020 for co-operative marketing activity to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing services to the regions. When the current crisis does abate, and when air connectivity and air services have been restored, Shannon Airport will once again be in a position to avail of this Scheme.</p>  <p>  Of course you will be aware that the Government has also put in place a broad range of supports to help mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 crisis on our citizens and businesses. One such support is the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.  This Scheme allows employers to continue to pay their employees during the COVID-19 emergency. It aims, as we know, to keep employees registered with their employers, so that they will be able to get back to work quickly as the Country enters the next phases of recovery. The Scheme, introduced on March 26 and  initially expected to last 12 weeks until mid-June 2020, was last week extended by Government to end August 2020.  Shannon Group is availing of the supports under this Scheme.</p></reply>

It is my understanding that these High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestor filters have been installed in all modern commercial jet aircraft for many years. For example, Airbus indicate they have been installed on new Airbus aircraft since 1994. Through communication at the National Air Transport Facilitation Committee, I understand that both the Ryanair and Aerlingus fleets are fitted with HEPA filters.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Irish Aviation Authority, that a small number of aircraft are unpressurised and continuously circulate fresh air in and out of the cabin, therefore would not typically have HEPA filters. IAA is unclear if any passenger aircraft have cabin re-circulation of air without a HEPA filter and is consulting with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to ascertain if any aircraft of this type are in use in Europe. </p>  <p>  I wish to highlight that the air conditioning and the use of HEPA filters are part of a suite of measures that can ensure passengers are safe, and not exposed to the COVID-19 virus, while flying, as set out in the European Centre for Disease Prevention &amp;amp; Control (ECDC) and EASA Guidance. The National Air Transport Facilitation Committee is coordinating the application of these measures by Irish airlines and airports through an agreed code of practice.</p></reply>

My Department previously provided funding for the construction of the Omeath to Carlingford Marina Greenway and this section is part of the  cross-border EU co-funded Interreg project that links Carlingford to Newry that is currently under construction. We will continue to work with  the Departments of Infrastructure and the Economy  in Northern Ireland to progress the cross border sections and sections connecting the route to Belfast and Larne. My Department will also work with relevant Local Authorities to facilitate this cycle way down the east coast to Rosslare Europort.</p>  <p>  When funding for the construction of Greenways was available in 2019 unfortunately none of the sections of the East Coast Cycle Way (or Greenway) were in a position to be awarded funding at that time as they did not have planning permission in place. However, a number of sections of the route were submitted for funding under the more recent Carbon Tax Fund that will support planning and design work this year and next. The decision on which projects to fund under that call will be a matter for the incoming Minister.</p>  <p>  I would encourage all Local Authorities to continue to work on progressing planning and design and consultation with landowners along the route of this proposal so that when construction funding is next available that they will be well placed to be awarded funding. </p></reply>

This would give security of gas supply nationally into the long term and in the context of Brexit.  </p>  <p>  It is also planned that the FRSU facility would be able to provide an LNG refuelling and bunkering facility for ships at the Port of Cork, which would meet the requirement under the EC Alternative Fuels Directive for TEN-T ports. This facility would also be able to provide competitive bunkering to all Irish ports.  </p>  <p>  A feasibility study is currently being undertaken by Next Decade on where the vessel should be moored and environmental and regulatory matters are being examined. The site chosen will most likely be near the Whitegate refinery, with Bord Gais and the ESB facilities already located in the port. The development will be subject to all the normal planning requirements and compliance with all necessary consents. The proposed project falls under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  I understand that the project has not progressed at the pace the Port of Cork Company originally envisaged. One of the factors for the delay is the worldwide economic climate and in particular the drop in oil prices internationally. The Port of Cork Company advise that the project remains at a very preliminary stage and the Memorandum of Understanding expires at the end of this year. </p>  <p>  The Port of Cork Company have advised that they do not have a Memorandum of Understanding  with Flex LNG.</p></reply>

There is also an ability to transport any of these three units to an island on the Sligo based Coast Guard Rescue helicopter. There are currently 17 strategically placed Coast Guard units around the coast who provide cliff rescue capabilities. There has been further development of these units in 2019 with the issuing of new equipment.</p>  <p>  A Value for Money review of the Coast Guard service, published in 2012, recommended the continuation of boat and shoreline rescue service and cessation of cliff training for the Bunbeg unit which is twinned with Tory Island. The strategic decision was to retain cliff rescue services in neighbouring CGUs, Mulroy and Killybegs.  The recommendation arose principally because of the non-utilisation of the cliff service balanced against the safety considerations of delivering a highly technical and intrinsically hazardous activity.  </p>  <p>  The Coast Guard, having monitored the demand for cliff rescue services has noted that the level of call outs responded to by Bunbeg/Tory Island CGU does not justify the maintenance of a cliff rescue service. For a CGU to engage in a high risk activity that demands a high level of resources in terms of training time, equipment and supervision, the benefits must clearly outweigh the risks. The maintenance of a cliff rescue team has been deprioritised, thus enabling the unit to concentrate on its boat rescue and shoreline search operations, which are regularly called into action. The investment which my Department has made in the Coast Guard rescue helicopter services has mitigated some of the demands for cliff rescue services.</p>  <p>  The Bunbeg/Tory Island CGU will continue to be a well-resourced team while the enhancement of boat rescue services and shoreline search by the unit will continue to be the priority based on need and risk.</p></reply>

However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.  I understand, however, that the current practice of the two main Irish airlines serving the Irish market in instances where flights are not cancelled, and having regard to the Covid-19 travel restrictions, is to offer their customers the opportunity to rebook a flight for later in the year or to receive a voucher.  In some instances airlines are waiving charges on rebooking and offering additional incentives such as extra value on vouchers. </p>  <p>  Clearly the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions across the globe.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  </p>  <p>  I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances, and it is something that I have raised directly with the two main Irish airlines.  I have asked that they take a fresh look at their current offerings to customers, that they bring more clarity to the messaging around entitlements and information on refund timeframes, and that they show discretion in favour of customers whose circumstances clearly make it unreasonable to expect them to travel, even if flights go. In looking to the future recovery, seeking ways to rebuild consumer confidence will be integral to initiating and indeed sustaining any future recovery for all parts of the aviation sector including the airlines. </p></reply>

If you do not get a reply within ten working days, please revert to my office.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Derry/Donegal to Dublin A5 project the planning and implementation of the A5 upgrade dual carriageway project is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland authorities.  </p>  <p>  As is the case for all such capital projects, the A5 upgrade scheme is subject to the planning assessment and approval process in Northern Ireland and since 2012 there have been a number of legal challenges to approvals related to the scheme.  This has led to unavoidable delays to the implementation of the proposed scheme.</p>  <p>  Most recently, a challenge to a decision by the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure to proceed with the A5 scheme resulted in the decision to proceed being quashed by the High Court at the request of the Department for Infrastructure in November 2018.  </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of that legal action the Department for Infrastructure updated project environmental assessments and undertook a public consultation on a number of environmental reports, including an Environmental Statement Addendum 2019. The Department announced in August 2019 that based on the responses to the consultation the Department had concluded that a further public inquiry was required. </p>  <p>  The Planning Appeals Commission was appointed to hold the inquiry and the hearings concluded on 13 March 2020.  It is understood that the Department for Infrastructure is awaiting the Inspector&rsquo;s report, which is scheduled for completion in September 2020.</p>  <p>  The funding arrangements in relation to the A5 have been governed by the Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan - A Fresh Start. Under this Agreement the Government is committed to provide funding of &pound;75 million (sterling) towards the cost of Phase 1a of the A5 upgrade scheme once the statutory planning process in Northern Ireland is concluded. The Government's commitment to provide funding of &pound;75 million (sterling) up to 2022 is also now included in the "New Decade, New Approach" document.  </p>  <p>  Allowing for the time required for the completion of the Public Inquiry process and for all new decisions relating to the project to be taken together with the possibility of a further legal challenge, the timeframe for the start of construction of Phase 1a of the A5 project is still uncertain.  In view of the current state of play in relation to the A5 scheme and the timeframes involved, provision was not made in 2019 and is not being made in the calendar year 2020 for funding for the scheme by this Department.</p></reply>

I can also confirm that, with the support of the Expert Group, my Department would, provided the Expert Group is satisfied, be able to indicate to the NGBs that their return to sport protocols appear compliant with the Roadmap and public health advice.</p>  <p>  To date, in excess of 40 separate protocols have been presented for consideration, some 25 of which have been reviewed by the Expert Group. The Expert Group will continue to review other protocols in the coming weeks on a phase-by-phase basis, re-evaluating protocols as and when the public health guidance changes. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these arrangements, which have been widely welcomed by the sport sector, are working well and are facilitating the safe return to sport by many sporting organisations nationwide.</p></reply>

The eligibility criteria for these funds has been further expanded to include objectives that will provide supports for small businesses, tourism, culture and natural heritage, among a range of other areas. This legislation is still being debated in the European Council and Operational Programmes for the period 2021-2027 will be agreed based on the new regulatory framework. The Operational Programmes are expected to be completed by the end of 2020, or early in 2021. The amount of European funding that will be allocated to Ireland and all other Member States is still being negotiated. My Department is exploring all potential EU financial supports for the tourism sector, and is examining the Commission&rsquo;s proposals in consultation with relevant Departments. EU leaders will discuss these proposals at the forthcoming European Council on 19 June, with a view to reaching early political agreement.</p></reply>

I would also note that providing this type of long-term investment framework represents international best practice in the area of transport planning.</p>  <p>  In relation to Galway, the Deputy should be aware that the issue of light rail in Galway city was comprehensively examined as part of the development of the Galway Transport Strategy. The Strategy concluded that a bus based public transport system, supported by various active travel and public realm improvements, represents the most appropriate system for Galway over the period considered by the Strategy. </p></reply>

The phased reopening will seek to meet the needs of the increasing range of parents and guardians who are returning to work, and prioritise the needs of vulnerable children who need childcare on child welfare grounds.</p>  <p>  This approach will facilitate the return of the following groups to services on 29 June:</p>  <p>  - children of health and social care workers, other frontline workers, childcare practitioners themselves, and parents who need access to childcare in order to return to work. In the first instance, places will be available to families from these categories who previously used the childcare services, </p>  <p>  - vulnerable children, including children sponsored under the National Childcare Scheme (for example, children who are in the international protection process and children of families who are homeless) along with children funded through legacy childcare schemes who are experiencing poverty, disadvantage or child welfare issues, </p>  <p>  - children with disabilities, including those preparing to start school in September, </p>  <p>  - other children previously registered in childcare services on March 12, whose parents continue to need childcare and who were assured that they would retain their place through conditions attached to the DCYA Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme, and  </p>  <p>  - subject to local availability of places, children who did not previously use childcare services and whose parents are now seeking a place.</p>  <p>  In cases where services do not have the capacity to accommodate all children in their service, services have been asked to prioritise the children of essential and frontline workers and vulnerable children for places when reopening on 29 June. </p>  <p>  If there is sufficient capacity, services will provide places for children previously registered with them on 12 March, whose parents continue to need childcare for employment or training purposes.</p>  <p>   A further key factor is that, in the best interests of children and parents, children should, as far as possible, be enabled to return to the childcare service they attended pre-COVID-19. Given the changed model of interaction and the time lapse since children last attended, it is important that there is as much continuity as possible for children. In light of the necessary changes, parents may also feel more reassured by placing their children in the care of childcare practitioners with whom they already have a relationship. Familiarity with other children attending the service and their parents may also help with the settling-in phase. </p>  <p>  On 10 June I was pleased to announce a comprehensive support package of &euro;75m to the ELC Sector, to support providers to reopen from 29 June.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has been an extremely difficult period for all ELC providers. This model of funding and phased reopening has been designed to align with public health guidance to ensure the safe reopening of services. Furthermore, it will support the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector as it begins again.</p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the importance of childcare sector, particularly in the context of the current conditions and with a view to supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.</p>  <p>  Recognising this, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) was launched on April 15th.</p>  <p>  The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: </p>  <p>  - to support the sustainability of the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare Sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p>  <p>  - to provide parents with a reassurance that they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, while providing them with reassurance that they will maintain places for their children; </p>  <p>  - and to give Early Learning and Care Educators security and retain these vital Educators in the sector. </p>  <p>  To achieve this, the Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme provides funding towards a portion of staff wages and a contribution towards services' overhead costs. Details of how to sign up have been made available through the Pobal programme platform used by childcare providers.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of robust oversight of Exchequer funding. This includes ensuring that funds provided under the TWSCS are used for purposes intended: to meet employee pay costs in conjunction with the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and contribute towards ongoing overhead costs. Where the funding provided is not used for these purposes, it may be appropriate to recoup. As part of ensuring that the TWSCS is fully understood by participants, my Department and Pobal have provided extensive information on this scheme, including the administrative and verification requirements. </p>  <p>  My Department may seek to recoup where there is a risk to Exchequer funding arising from a breach in the terms of the Funding Agreement. Should the verification process identify any such breaches,  funds may be sought to be recouped by the Department or netted off against future payments.  It is not possible to state how much will be recouped at this present time as the scheme is ongoing.</p>  <p>  My Department will take a reasonable and supportive approach to assessing the use of funding provided to services in this difficult time. I hope that all participating providers will use the money provided under the scheme in the manner set out in the Funding Agreement. A wide variety of items qualify as eligible expenditure, and my Department's priority is to support services to reopen in line with public health advice.</p>  <p>  The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the childcare sector. Further supports and funding are available from my Department including the Programme Support Payment, which will be paid to eligible services in June. Services may also be eligible for the Restart Grant for Small Business, administered by Local Authorities, and for other supports from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  I would also note there are supports available to improve the sustainability of services during normal times, and these remain available to services which may still be facing regular challenges on top of the difficulties imposed by the pandemic.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, and guided by the expert advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC), ELC and SAC services can resume from 29 June. I am pleased that Government have committed a &euro;75m package of funding for reopening services over the summer months. This substantial investment recognises the important role that the ELC and SAC sector plays in the societal and economic infrastructure of the country. </p>  <p>  The new funding package contains four significant elements: </p>  <p>  - A once-off reopening support payment for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. </p>  <p>  - A once-off COVID-19 capital grant for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. </p>  <p>  - Continued access for eligible providers to the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) </p>  <p>  - Resumption of DCYA ELC and SAC programmes. NCS, CCSP and TEC will be available again for children attending ELC and SAC services from 29 June. </p>  <p>  An evidence-based approach was taken to develop this funding package. My Department undertook primary research to help forecast supply of, and demand for, ELC and SAC in the initial reopening period. Data was used from the Independent Review of Costs, which show that staff costs represent approximately 70 percent of the cost of delivering ELC and SAC - a significant portion of which is funded through the TWSS.</p>  <p>  In developing the funding package, I recognise that a reduced number of children are likely to attend ELC and SAC services in the initial weeks of reopening. This funding package is tailored to allow providers to operate with potentially less parental income and to assist in meeting the possible costs associated with complying with public health requirements. The TWSS, in particular ensures a very significant proportion of the operating costs are met by the State.</p>  <p>  Expert guidance on the safe reopening of ELC and SAC services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on 29 May.  The guidance recommends use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model which restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. Based on advice provided by the HPSC, I do not propose to changes to Regulations in relation to either the adult-child ratios or the floor-space requirements for ELC or SAC services as such changes are unnecessary where "play pods" are in use. My Department has made the HPSC guidance and a number of other resources available to providers to assist them with reopening and to understand what is required of them.</p>  <p>  The funding package will also ensure that ELC and SAC providers will not charge higher fees than they did pre-COVID-19. This will benefit parents and children returning to services.</p>  <p>  A detailed set of FAQs was published on 12 June to ensure that providers are fully informed of the new funding package.  My officials will ensure that the application process will be as straightforward as possible.</p>  <p>  A key policy priority for my Department is the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector and hence it has and continues to work intensively to support services to re-open after COVID-19. The reopening funding aims to support providers to reopen, staff to remain in the sector, parents to resume work, and children to benefit from quality ELC and SAC.</p></reply>

In its short update the Commission says its final report is very close to completion but it has encountered delays as a direct result of Covid-19 restrictions. For this reason, the Commission requested an extension to complete its work in accordance with the provisions of the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004. </p>  <p>  Notably, the Commission first advised me that it would require additional time to complete its final report in a phone call the day before it submitted this formal request. </p>  <p>  At its meeting on Friday 12 June, the Government agreed to amend the Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference to provide for the extension sought. The final report is now due to be delivered on 30 October 2020 at the latest. The Government recognises that the public interest is best served by facilitating the Commission to produce an evidence based determination on what happened to vulnerable mothers and children in these institutions. The Commission has engaged with hundreds of former residents in its work and is attempting to comprehensively analyse information at a level beyond what has ever been possible to date.  In agreeing to this further extension, the Government&rsquo;s priority is to safeguard this substantial work so that the independent Commission can comprehensively address these crucial questions and conclude matters as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the legislative framework. </p>  <p>  I know many former residents and their families will be deeply disappointed with this delay.  However, I also know that they will understand the overwhelming impact which Covid-19 and the associated public health restrictions have had on all our lives. My Department used existing channels of communication to ensure that former residents, their families and supporters were the first to be made aware of the new timeframe ahead of this information appearing in the media. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that when a Commission submits its final report there are a number of procedural matters which must be addressed before the relevant Minister could seek the approval of Government to publish the report. For this reason there will always be a time interval between receipt of such reports and the separate arrangements for their publication. </p>  <p>  I share the wish of all interested parties to see the Commission conclude its work as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

Tusla conducted a commissioning process to identify service providers that would lead on service provision, which was completed in September 2019.</p>  <p>  As the procurement of outreach workers is an operational matter, I have requested that Tusla respond to you directly on this issue.</p></reply>

The Guidance for Reopening webpage includes health guidance (published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre), regulatory guidance and practice supports.</p><p>The public health advice from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is that while there is no evidence base on which to define a maximum play-pod size, play-pods should be kept as small as is likely to be reasonably practical in the specific childcare context. </p><p>The maximum adult-child ratios required by the Early Years Services Regulations, 2016 will remain unchanged and so services must continue to operate within them. In most cases there should be either one or two adults in a &lsquo;play-pod&rsquo; in order to keep play-pod sizes small. Therefore, play-pod size will be limited by those ratios. For example, a play-pod that involves 3-6 year olds in full day care may have a maximum size of either nine (one adult and eight children) or 18 (two adults and 16 children). For children under 1 in full day care the maximum play-pod size can be either four (one adult and three children) or eight (two adults and six children). For 1-2 year olds maximum play-pod sizes may be six (one adult and five children) or 12 (two adults and ten children). </p><p>While in the majority of cases there will be no more than two adults in a play-pod, there may be some scenarios where a third adult will be required e.g. where an individual is employed to support a child with additional needs or where Tusla, as regulator, has suggested that an additional staff member is required to help with a group where there is challenging behaviour. In those instances, the additional adult would not result in any additional children in the play-pod.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, and guided by the expert advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC), ELC and SAC services can resume from 29 June. I am pleased that Government have committed a &euro;75m package of funding for reopening services over the summer months. This substantial investment recognises the important role that the ELC and SAC sector plays in the societal and economic infrastructure of the country. </p>  <p>  The new funding package contains four significant elements: </p>  <p>  - A once-off reopening support payment for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. </p>  <p>  - A once-off COVID-19 capital grant for DCYA-funded providers opening between 29 June and early September. </p>  <p>  - Continued access for eligible providers to the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) </p>  <p>  - Resumption of DCYA ELC and SAC programmes. NCS, CCSP and TEC will be available again for children attending ELC and SAC services from 29 June. </p>  <p>  In developing the funding package, I recognise that a reduced number of children are likely to attend ELC and SAC services in the initial weeks of reopening. This funding package is tailored to allow providers to operate with potentially less parental income and to assist in meeting the possible costs associated with complying with public health requirements, including additional staffing costs.</p>  <p>  Expert guidance on the safe reopening of ELC and SAC services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on 29 May.  The guidance recommends use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model which restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. Based on advice provided by the HPSC, I do not propose to changes to Regulations in relation to either the adult-child ratios or the floor-space requirements for ELC or SAC services as such changes are unnecessary where "play pods" are in use. </p>  <p>  The funding package will also ensure that ELC and SAC providers will not charge higher fees than they did pre-COVID-19. This will benefit parents and children returning to services.</p>  <p>  A detailed set of FAQs was published on 12 June to ensure that providers are fully informed of the new funding package. Further information will be provided in the coming weeks. My officials will ensure that the application process will be as straightforward as possible.</p>  <p>  A key policy priority for my Department is the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector and hence it has and continues to work intensively to support services to re-open after COVID-19. The reopening funding aims to support providers to reopen, staff to remain in the sector, parents to resume work, and children to benefit from quality ELC and SAC.</p></reply>

This culminated in the publication, by the HPSC, of &quot;Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for Settings Providing Childcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic&quot; on 29th May. This guidance is available on the HPSC website and the Guidance for Reopening webpage .</p><p>While liaising with the HPSC, my Department sought advice on testing for staff in childcare services. The public health advice is that staff/children do not need to be tested for COVID-19 unless they are displaying symptoms such as fever (high temperature), cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. There is no requirement for staff to be prioritised for testing. Staff and parents should be advised to not attend the service if they or their child is displaying symptoms. They should remain at home and contact their doctor immediately. This has been detailed in the FAQs published on the First 5 website.</p><p>The latest data from the Department of Health (as of 14 June) shows that it takes on average 1.2 days for the testing process to be completed and 2.4 days for contract tracing to be carried out. </p></reply>

That guidance details options for drop off and collection at Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare settings which seek to ensure physical distancing between adults is maintained as far as practicable. The public health advice is that physical distancing between adults could be achieved by staggering arrival and collection times, by having demarcated waiting areas outside the entrance to the setting, or by asking parents to wait with their children in their car until a childcare practitioner comes to collect them.</p><p>Physical distancing between parents and practitioners will not be possible for the drop-off and collection of babies or very young children. It is also acknowledged that the option of collection from cars may not be appropriate in many settings or for younger children and may cause anxiety among children and parents. Collection from cars may work best for school-age children. Service providers are asked to consider what works best in the context of their own setting, the outside space available, the age range of their children, and the needs of parents. </p><p>Whatever approach is used, providers should ensure that, wherever possible, physical distance is maintained between adults and between children from different 'play-pods' within the setting.</p></reply>

As the COVID-19 restrictions are eased in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, our rural towns and villages will have an important role to play in supporting economic activity and in providing safe spaces for people to meet. My Department is considering the appropriate approach for many of its programmes in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s Town and Village Renewal Scheme has been developed to help our towns and villages to bounce back from the impact of COVID-19. This scheme was launched on 27 May 2020 and includes an Accelerated Measure in response  to COVID-19.  </p><p>This measure focuses on immediate interventions that can be delivered in the short-term to assist towns and villages to adapt to COVID-19. It will be administered by Local Authorities who will have the autonomy to identify and develop their own solutions in consultation with local business interests, Town Teams and community groups as appropriate. </p><p>The projects funded can be delivered directly by the Local Authority or by a community/business organisation. It is expected that the projects will involve expenditure on supplies and services of a capital nature to adapt to public health requirements. Full details of the 2020 Town and Village Scheme are available at .</p><p>The 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) is also being considered in that context. The CEP funded by my Department provides small capital grants to community groups. Typical projects funded under this programme can include the renovation of community centres, community amenities, improvements to town parks, common areas and spaces, CCTV equipment and energy efficiency-type projects. The CEP is administered by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area. </p><p>The CL&Aacute;R 2020 programme considers support for interventions that make school/community facility environs healthier and safer for the children attending the schools, and for children and adults using the community facilities. </p><p>This measure has been broadened to allow additional investments to adapt areas around schools and community facilities to help meet new public health requirements arising from COVID-19.

A further 450 projects requesting over &euro;32.7 million are at various stages of the approvals process.  Payments can continue to be made beyond 2020 in respect of projects approved before the end of this year.</p><p>Funding under the LEADER programme is not targeted at any particular group or sector in rural communities.  It is, rather, focused on a thematic approach to rural development under the headings of Economic Development, Enterprise Development and Job Creation; Social Inclusion; and the Rural Environment.  The Department does not, therefore, capture details of the amount of funding approved specifically for women's groups or other sectoral organisations.</p><p>Decisions on the nature of the projects to be supported and the funding to be awarded are solely a matter for each LAG.</p><p><b>Table 1: LEADER 2014-2020 Categories of expenditure broken down per year</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Preparatory   Support</th>       <th>Administration &amp;amp; animation</th>       <th>Projects</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>&euro;1,251,185.25</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;1,251,185.25</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;119,785.45</td>       <td>&euro;1,141,135.09</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;1,260,920.54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;97,141.59</td>       <td>&euro;11,364,865.35</td>       <td>&euro;661,844.12</td>       <td>&euro;12,123,851.06</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;10,478,473.65</td>       <td>&euro;12,505,239.04</td>       <td>&euro;22,983,712.69</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;4,132.15</td>       <td>&euro;11,633,930.13</td>       <td>&euro;30,669,533.47</td>       <td>&euro;42,307,595.75</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 (to date)</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro; 4,093,993.86</td>       <td>&euro;17,302,081.14</td>       <td>&euro;21,396,075.00</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The terms and conditions of individual employment contracts may provide additional specifics within those parameters such as stipulations in relation to the entitlement to extra days' leave above what is statutorily required by the Act.</p><p>Section 19 of the Act provides that an employee shall be entitled to paid annual leave equal to:</p><p>(a) 4 working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment),</p><p>(b) One third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 177 hours, or </p><p>(c) 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 weeks).</p><p>In calculating how many days leave to which an employee may be entitled, employers should include all hours worked, and take account of time spent on annual leave, time spent on maternity leave, parental leave, force majeure leave or adoptive leave, sick leave and time spent on the first 13 weeks of carer's leave.</p><p>If an employee has lost all of their employment due to the current crisis and are in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, they are not in a position to accrue annual leave.  If an employee is in receipt of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners), they accrue annual leave only in respect of the hours which they actually work. Employees do not accrue annual leave while on temporary lay-off. </p><p>The determination of whether a person is entitled to payment from their employer in respect of a public holiday is also governed by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  Under the Act, for each of the nine public holidays in a year, an employee is entitled to either a paid day off on the holiday, a paid day off within a month of the holiday, an extra day&rsquo;s annual leave, or an extra day&rsquo;s pay.  If a person is on temporary lay-off they are entitled to benefit for the public holidays that fall within the first thirteen weeks of lay-off.  </p><p>An employee may present a complaint to the WRC if it appears that the employer has failed to provide the correct holiday entitlements to which the employee is entitled under the Act.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The rate of payment will remain at a flat rate of &euro;350 until 29th June when a two-level payment structure will be introduced to link the pandemic unemployment payment level to gross prior earnings.  This change to the payment structure will ensure that the rate is fair and targeted.</p>  <p>  Where a person&rsquo;s gross weekly earnings were &euro;200 or higher there will be no change to their rate of payment.  If a person&rsquo;s gross weekly earnings were under &euro;200 the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment will be adjusted to &euro;203.  This change will take effect in payments made from Tuesday 7 July.</p>  <p>  To determine the gross weekly earnings for the purpose of calculating the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment the Department will examine the employee&rsquo;s average gross weekly earnings in 2019 and January and February 2020, and the higher figure will be used.  For example, if an employee&rsquo;s average gross weekly earnings in 2019 were &euro;195 and &euro;210 in 2020, the figure of &euro;210 will be used. Similarly if the employee&rsquo;s average gross weekly earnings in 2019 were higher than in 2020, the 2019 figure will be used.  Tips are treated as reckonable income and are taxed in the normal way.</p>  <p>  For self employed people their gross average weekly income for 2018 will be used to calculate the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment, the last tax year for which verifiable data on self-employed income is available.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

Changes were also announced to the structure of this payment which means that it continues to be a strong support but is also fair and targeted. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware that there are certain sectors which will be affected by business closures longer than others and the confirmation that this payment will be available until early August provides financial certainty to people affected.  My colleague, the Minister for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has introduced a range of supports and guidance to assist businesses with their recovery from the severe financial impacts of the pandemic and the details are available on that Department's website at www.dbei.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  The conditions for receipt of this emergency payment are that a person must be of working age between 18 and up to 66 years old, have been in employment immediately before 13th March and have lost their income from employment due to the pandemic.  Where a person does not meet the conditions for receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and they are unemployed for 4 days or more in a week they can apply for the social-insurance based jobseekers benefit or means tested jobseekers allowance.  Any person who is experiencing financial hardship may be eligible for other financial support under the supplementary welfare allowance. </p>  <p>  The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 which I introduced on the 4th March 2019 provides that zero hour contracts are prohibited except in situations of genuine casual employment and where they are essential to allow employers to provide cover in emergency situations or to cover short-term absence.  This important legislation will improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position. </p></reply>

Directors of firms have, under company law provisions, very serious and personal responsibilities to ensure that they are in a position to continue to trade and importantly not to trade whilst insolvent.   </p>  <p>  Finally, and this is important for employees who may be in a position to negotiate a redundancy package with the many genuine employers in our economy, if a company is restricted from making employees redundant and has to retain them on payroll, the assets of that company will dissipate and mean that any negotiated redundancy package has less chance of success. </p></reply>

People aged 66 or over do not pay any social insurance contributions.</p>  <p>  A person in receipt of the State Contributory Pension, which is based on PRSI contributions, can retain all of their State pension as well as their employment income and retain that pension payment if they lose employment income, thus guaranteeing an income support.  If a person is not in receipt of the maximum rate of State Pension Contributory, they may be eligible for an increased weekly rate of payment on the State non-contributory means tested pension depending on their circumstances. </p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of the non-contributory or means-tested pension who are also in receipt of an employment income may have their pension payment increased if they lose that employment income or if it is reduced.  Similarly if a person aged over 66 who did not previously qualify or make an application for a means-tested pension may qualify for a pension payment if their circumstances change .</p>  <p>  The Department does not hold data on the number of persons aged 66 years and who have lost their employment as a result of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  A person of any age who is experiencing financial hardship can access assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme including Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments where the need is demonstrated. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position at this time. </p></reply>

These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. To date, almost 6.5 million payments have issued to just over 670,000 individuals at a cost of over &euro;2.25 Billion. </p>  <p>  Currently, the Department is focused on processing and managing payments to ensure that they continue to be made to all who qualify for them.

The table attached gives details of the required notice for different periods of service.  Furthermore Section 5 and Schedule 2 of the 1973 Act provide that if an employee is made redundant and they are not required to work out the notice or there is no work available, they are entitled to payment in lieu of notice.</p><p>In the event of a dispute the employee's recourse is to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) for a determination by an adjudication officer.  The WRC is the organisation which is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  The person in question should contact the Customer Service section of the WRC , who operate a telephone helpline at 1890 808090, in relation to their concerns regarding their employment rights.  A key function of the Customer Service section is to provide information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, and how to obtain redress where appropriate. </p><p><b>Notice periods under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Length of service</th>       <th>Minimum Notice</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 years and up to 5 years</td>       <td>2 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years and up to 10 years</td>       <td>4 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10 years and up to 15 years</td>       <td>6 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Over 15 years</td>       <td>8 weeks</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The key challenge facing my Department and the Intreo Service at that time was how to increase participation rates in an economy that was at full employment, as generally understood.  Against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant disruption to Ireland&rsquo;s labour market, the focus has turned to implementing an economic recovery agenda.</p>  <p>  The Labour Market Advisory Council[1] is an advisory body to my Department and the Government and its membership brings together a disparate group of members from industry, academia, business and civil society. </p>  <p>  I set the Terms of Reference and before finalising them received some valuable input from Council members. The overarching objective of these terms of reference is to provide advice to the Department and Government on the efficient operation of the labour market with a particular view to increasing participation rates, minimising unemployment levels and reducing average unemployment durations. The Council will have regard to UN Sustainable Development Goal 8 which promotes &lsquo;sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>The Advisory Council has met on three occasions to date (24 April, 8 May and 22 May) with senior officials from my Department and across Government attending on an Ex-Officio basis.  On occasion, I envisage that the Council may invite a representative body or expert to discuss issues pertinent to the Council&rsquo;s work programme.</p>  <p>  The first task assigned to the Advisory Council was to develop, as a matter of urgency, proposals for actions to tackle the labour market challenges arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. A Policy Paper, prepared by the Council in response to this mandate, outlines a series of recommendations for public policy and labour market responses needed to tackle the labour market challenges arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. This Paper is currently being considered.  The Advisory Council has also recently published a Working Paper examining the initial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Irish labour market. </p>  <p>  Building and sustaining skills in the labour force will require a key focus as the labour market recovers, with a particular emphasis on skills which will be in demand. Furthermore, consideration must be given to how best to retain and rehire skilled labour and resume operations. The Council will be an important vehicle in providing guidance on these issues and in assisting with the development of public policy responses that will support labour market recovery and assist us to retrain and re-employ all those whose employment has been disrupted by the pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Council will also provide advice and guidance on the successor employment services strategy to replace Pathways to Work, covering the period 2020-2025.  Work is underway within my Department on the revised strategy to ensure that positive labour market outcomes are achievable for all groups in society and that the Irish labour force is well positioned to respond to both on-going and future economic challenges.</p>  <p>  The Council recognises that there are a range of further challenges facing Ireland&rsquo;s labour market. These include fast-tracking digital transformation in response to the Covid-19 crisis; the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on particular cohorts of the labour market including young people, women, and ethnic minorities; the challenges posed to many vulnerable sectors and regions by Brexit; climate change; population ageing; ensuring the availability of decent work for all &ndash; in particular for groups with low participation rates &ndash; and the implications of the changing world of work. It is proposed to deal with these topics in future Policy Papers. </p>  <p>  [1] See LMAC Webpage: www.gov.ie/en/publication/656a27-labour-market-advisory-council/.</p></reply>

Currently the weekly personal rate for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients aged 18-24 years is &euro;112.70.  If a young jobseeker participates in education or training they will receive the maximum personal rate which is &euro;203 per week. Reduced rates do not apply to all young people under 25 including those with a qualified child and those who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency, or TUSLA, during the 12 months before they reached 18.  For this reason I am advised that it is not possible to identify current recipients receiving the personal rate of &euro;203 per week solely due to living independently and receipt of a housing support.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2020 I increased the rate of jobseeker's allowance for 18-24 year olds who are living independently and in receipt of State housing supports including rent supplement and the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). The measure which was implemented on 1 January 2020 provides significant financial support towards the housing costs of these young jobseekers who are eligible as their weekly jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rates will increase by &euro;90.30. </p>  <p>  185 jobseekers aged under 25 who previously received a reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance had an increase in their payments on or after January 1st.</p></reply>

The EPA has classified the water quality in Dublin Bay as &lsquo;good&rsquo; under the water framework directive for the period 2013 to 2018, an improvement on the &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; status achieved during the 2007 to 2009 period.</p>  <p>  Significant investment in waste water infrastructure continues and is provided for in the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan. It is estimated that &euro;1.9bn will be invested in waste water projects between 2019 to 2024.  It is well known that our waste water networks require ongoing and sustained investment to bring these up to the required standard of treatment; to deal with population growth; and to adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Ringsend wastewater treatment plant was originally designed and built to treat wastewater for a population equivalent of 1.64 million and is now overloaded. In response, Irish Water is currently undertaking a major upgrade of the plant to ensure that the wastewater is treated to the required standard, to reduce nutrient discharges, and to improve the water quality in the Lower Liffey Estuary.  Irish Water is installing a novel Aerobic Granular Sludge (AGS) technology which is an advanced nutrient removal process that is designed to consistently produce high-quality treated waste-water which can be safely discharged into Dublin Bay. This upgrade will increase the capacity of the plant to cater for the growing population of the Greater Dublin Area and will address compliance with EU law.  Planning permission was granted for the project in April 2019, and will be completed in two phases; bringing the plant up to compliance with EU law in 2022 and a capacity upgrade by 2024.</p>  <p>  There are instances of bathing water quality issues in some areas of the Bay.  There are multi-faceted sources of pollution that may be impacting on the bathing water quality in Dublin Bay. This includes sewer misconnections to surface water drains and streams, sewer storm water overflows, wildlife and dog-fouling.  The Dublin local authorities are working together to diagnose the root-causes and put in place programmes to solve these issues.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, that any water that is released from storm-water overflows into Dublin Bay happens after heavy or prolonged spells of rain, and has been heavily diluted with rainwater.</p></reply>

According to the most recent guidance from the WHO, published 23 April 2020, the main routes of transmission are respiratory droplets and direct contact. The risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus from the faeces of an infected person appears to be low.</p>  <p>  Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  In that role, Irish Water is in contact with water and waste water utility companies across Europe to exchange international experience and information on responding to the operational and other risks associated with COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre and the Directorate General for Environment are jointly organising a waste water based monitoring system for the prevalence of COVID-19 in the populations and had looked for other member states to participate in this programme.

Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the provisions of the Valuation Acts. In certain circumstance, vacant properties may receive a partial waiver of rates, at the discretion of the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>  In order to support the local government sector, my Department is continuing to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow generally under review and will work with all local authorities on both collective and individual issues arising.  In addition, my Department has engaged with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to commercial rates and local authority funding issues, as well as the role that local authorities may be in a position to play in supporting economic recovery. </p>  <p>  To that end, on 2 May 2020, the Government announced that a waiver of commercial rates will apply to all businesses that have been forced to close due to public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period. These costs will be met by the Exchequer.  The administration by local authorities of this measure will be by way of a credit in lieu of commercial rates.  My Department is currently preparing further guidance on the scope and application of the waiver for local authorities.   </p>  <p>  Government has also decided that the position following the end of the 3 month waiver will be reviewed at a later date, as part of a wider review of options to support enterprise and employment, and associated local authority funding implications, once the unwinding of public health restrictions has advanced. </p></reply>

Further to this, conditions regulating construction working hours are generally attached to planning permissions for development.</p>  <p>  Within the conditions attached to a planning permission, these may be include provision for derogation and local agreement regarding construction conditions, to allow for the undertaking of particular activities outside "normal" operating hours (e.g. a continuous pour of concrete on a large site).</p>  <p>  As you are aware, the Government published its Roadmap for Re-Opening Society and Business on 1 May last with a view to gradually easing the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions on a phased basis. The Roadmap is aimed at keeping the level of transmission as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions proportionately with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by easing restrictions to facilitate, amongst other things, the country&rsquo;s economic recovery from the pandemic.</p>  <p>  In the context of the return to work of the construction sector on 18 May last under Phase 1 of the Roadmap, my Department issued Circular Letter PL 06/2020 to planning authorities on 15 May last relating to working hours conditions attached to planning permissions. Having regard to the exceptional circumstances faced arising from the pandemic and the consequential need to facilitate, where reasonable, the splitting of shifts for separating trades and activities required to achieve physical distancing on construction sites in accordance with relevant public health/ health and safety advice and protocols, while simultaneously seeking to balance this with the need to ensure output and productivity by the sector, the Circular Letter requested each planning authority to determine and agree, in the context of a national civil emergency, a reasonable extent of discretion in respect of the hours of operation of construction sites in excess of those specified by planning condition and, where applicable, to reach agreement in respect of derogation, for all or some of the period to 9 November 2020.</p>  <p>  Noting that all sites are different, the Circular Letter advised that decisions to extend working hours on construction sites should be applied on a case-by-case basis by planning authorities, having regard to individual local circumstances including factors such as:  </p>  <p>  - the nature, scale, extent and location of the construction site i.e. rural/urban, smallscale/major development, single/multi storey etc; </p>  <p>  - in particular, the proximity of the construction site to occupied homes and other types of premises or land uses that may be potentially sensitive receptors in the area concerned i.e. number, distance and type;</p>  <p>   - the likelihood of noise, dust or other emissions, traffic and local parking impacts, and any proposed ameliorative measures, including management/monitoring; </p>  <p>  - cumulative impacts i.e. where there is more than one site in close proximity, particularly in urban areas; </p>  <p>  - the proposed hours of construction beyond those conditioned and their frequency and duration; </p>  <p>  - the adequacy of site construction, management procedures, including any community liaison plan;  </p>  <p>  - any other relevant factors, including stage of construction (external &amp;amp; internal works etc).</p>  <p>  As indicated, the operation of derogations and allowing for the extension of working hours on construction sites is a matter for individual planning authorities to determine on a case by case basis having regard to the criteria outlined above. Under section 30 of the Act, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned, except in specified circumstances, which do not apply in this case.</p></reply>

In this context, Cost Rental is defined as housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only.  Rents are not set by the market according to supply and demand. It represents a new form of rental tenure for Ireland and a new State intervention into the rental market.</p>  <p>  A working group involving my Department, the Land Development Agency (LDA), the Housing Agency,  local authority representation and other stakeholders is developing the policy framework for a broad Cost Rental model. The group is examining how a sustainable financing and implementation structure can be established to deliver Cost Rental units at the necessary scale. Detailed operational and eligibility criteria for Cost Rental will be informed by this evidence building and policy work.</p>  <p>  This work is being assisted by research which has been commissioned by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on behalf of the Department. The EIB has extensive international experience in providing support for affordable housing and is providing technical assistance in assessing the potential market for Cost Rental in Ireland. Fundamental aspects such as the ownership of potential units delivered under Cost Rental will depend on the eventual model chosen as a result of this policy work.</p>  <p>  Formulation of Cost Rental policy is also being supported by two designated pilot projects, at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and at Emmet Road, Inchicore, Dublin City (the former St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate). The Enniskerry Road development has already commenced construction, supported by EIB funding, and the first homes are anticipated to come on stream from 2021. The Cost Rental homes delivered under this model at Enniskerry Road will be owned and managed by two Approved Housing Bodies, Tuath and Respond. Plans for the Emmet Road site are at the planning and design and  stage, through under the proposed model it is expected that these homes will be owned by Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the LDA and other local authorities are actively considering Cost Rental as an option for sites within their land portfolios. An example of this can be seen in the planning application which has been submitted for a site at Shanganagh in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the LDA is working in partnership with the County Council. In this case, it is currently envisaged that these Cost Rental units will be owned and managed by the LDA. On its own portfolio of sites, the LDA may develop Cost Rental housing in order to fulfil the Government&rsquo;s Public Lands Affordability Requirement.  This requires that at least 30% of the housing potential of surplus Government land should be delivered as affordable housing, either Affordable Purchase or Cost Rental.</p></reply>

Given the particular circumstances of BTR, the Guidelines recommend that BTR project promoters engage closely with the relevant planning authority with regard to how best to discharge the Part V agreement, prior to lodging any planning application.</p><p>While the Apartment Guidelines allow for some limited design flexibility in BTR developments, both the minimum apartment size standard and dual aspect ratio are identical to those set out as <s>a</s>requirements for other apartment developments, both private and social.  In addition, while the application of design flexibility is not mandatory, BTR development must, in accordance with a Specific Planning Policy Requirement (SPPR 7), include proposals for both:</p><p>-  &quot;Resident Support Facilities&quot;, identified as facilities relating to the operation of the development for residents, including laundry, concierge and management facilities, maintenance/repair services and waste management; and </p><p>-  &quot;Resident Services and Amenities&quot;, identified as facilities for communal recreational and other activities by residents, including sports facilities, shared TV/lounge areas, work/study spaces, function rooms for private dining.</p><p>The more flexible BTR standards are not applicable to social housing delivery more generally i.e. to non-BTR development.</p><p>The following table compares social housing apartment standards as set out in Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments; Guidelines for Planning Authorities and Build to Rent standards as also set out in the guidelines. </p><p>Table 1: Comparison between Social Housing Apartment Standards and Build to Rent Standards <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Design consideration</th>       <th>Non-BTR Apartment Standards (Private and Social)</th>       <th>Build to Rent Apartment Standards</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Space Standard</td>       <td>Studio   Minimum</td>       <td>37 sqm</td>       <td>37sqm</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>1B/2P   Minimum</td>       <td>45 sqm</td>       <td>45 sqm</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2B/3P   Minimum</td>       <td>63 sqm <br /><br />(Max 10% of units)</td>       <td>63 sqm <br /><br />(Max 10% of units)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2B/4P   Minimum</td>       <td>75 sqm</td>       <td>75 sqm</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>3B/5P   Minimum</td>       <td>90 sqm</td>       <td>90 sqm</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Majority of units 10%&amp;gt;

The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers who have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that current applicants for a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan may be experiencing difficulties arising out of COVID-19. Local authorities are being asked to show flexibility when dealing with applicants at all stages of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan process from application and approval, to drawdown and appeal and should extend the time periods as necessary to accommodate those who may be experiencing difficulties arising out of COVID 19 restrictions.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, local authorities are also required to be prudent with their lending, both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, and ensure that mortgages are only advanced based on up to date financial and employment data from applicants as appropriate, having regard to the implications that COVID-19 has had for many businesses and employers. My Department has issued guidance to local authorities in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its Credit Committee on a case-by-case basis. Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the statutory credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency of treatment for all applicants.</p>  <p>  Loan applicants who are dissatisfied with a loan application decision of a local authority Credit Committee may appeal that decision to the local authority.

Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes. </p>  <p>  The amount of rates paid by a property is based on its rateable valuation, as determined by the Valuation Office, multiplied the Annual Rate on Valuation set annually by the elected members of the local authority in which the property is located.  Rateable valuation of hotels and other properties in the hospitality sector determined by the Valuation Office already reflects the trading information such as the trading pattern, turnover, expenditure etc. of individual properties thereby taking account of locations where seasonality is a factor. </p>  <p>  In order to support the local government sector, my Department is continuing to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow generally under review and will work with all local authorities on both collective and individual issues arising.  In addition, my Department has engaged with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to commercial rates and local authority funding issues, as well as the role that local authorities may be in a position to play in supporting economic recovery. </p>  <p>  To that end, on 2 May 2020, the Government announced that a waiver of commercial rates will apply to all businesses that have been forced to close due to public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period. These costs will be met by the Exchequer.  The administration by local authorities of this measure will be by way of a credit in lieu of commercial rates.  My Department is currently preparing further guidance on the scope and application of the waiver for local authorities.   </p>  <p>  Government has also decided that the position following the end of the 3 month waiver will be reviewed at a later date, as part of a wider review of options to support enterprise and employment, and associated local authority funding implications, once the unwinding of public health restrictions has advanced.</p></reply>

The measures also prohibit any increase to rent for the duration of the emergency period.  Initially, these emergency laws will last for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary. </p><p>Tenants are required to pay rent to their landlord during the COVID-19 emergency period and, in the event of tenants having difficulty doing so, they are encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity.  They should also engage with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) as income supports and Rent Supplement are available to assist them.  Further information on these supports can be found by calling the DEASP Income Support Helpline for Covid-19 on 1890 800 024 or by visiting the DEASP website at:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-employment-affairs-and-social-protection/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/home.aspx. </p><p>My Department and the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) urge landlords to consider the negative impacts of COVID-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears might arise. I have asked my Department to undertake a piece of research on the potential accumulation of rent arrears during the emergency period in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) as part of the established Department/ESRI housing research programme.  The research will have regard to the range of rental and income supports being made available to those affected by COVID-19, and will assess the combined impact that these supports together with the changed consumption patterns have on the incidence of arrears.</p><p>My Department recently published a Guidance Document on COVID-19 supports for landlords and tenants, which sets out the emergency rental measures and income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during the emergency period.The Guidance document is available at: </p><p>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/COVID_Update_Guidance_Document_final.pdf </p><p>and a list of Frequently Asked Questions has been developed and is available at:</p><p>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/Comms%20and%20Research/FAQs_on_Emergency_Legislation_Final.pdf </p><p>During the emergency period, a landlord can still serve their tenant with a warning notice if their tenant is in rent arrears or otherwise failing to fulfil their obligations. The landlord must give their tenant 28 days, rather than the usual 14 days, from receipt of a rent arrears warning notice to pay the arrears. The longer rent arrears warning notice during the emergency period is intended to  afford more time for tenants to seek any necessary income support. A notice of tenancy termination cannot be served by a landlord during the emergency period for any reason.</p><p>The RTB is encouraging all customers who may require assistance or advice, including in relation to any threatened eviction, to contact them via their web chat service as there may be delays to their phone lines during the emergency period. The webchat service can be accessed at the following link: .</p><p>Under the legislation, the process for any extension of the 3 month COVID-19 emergency period involves the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government requesting the Government to make an Order, having consulted with the Minister for Health and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Government must consider it appropriate and be satisfied that it is in the public interest to extend the emergency period having regard to: </p><p>- the threat to public health; </p><p>- the highly contagious nature of COVID-19; and </p><p>- the need to restrict the movement of persons to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  </p><p>The consideration of whether to request the Government to make an Order to extend the emergency period is ongoing and any subsequent request to Government will be made at the appropriate time and in accordance with the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  </p><p>It is not possible to amend the provisions of the Act at this time.</p></reply>

The webchat service can be accessed at the following link: .</p><p>Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, a tenant sources their own accommodation in the private rented market. The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended.  HAP supported tenancies are afforded the same protections as all private rented tenancies.  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord beyond that of their HAP payment. However, decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation, is solely a matter for the local authority concerned and local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.</p><p>Where HAP tenants are not financially impacted by the COVID-19 measures, they are expected to continue to pay their HAP differential rent.  However, if tenants&rsquo; circumstances change, the local authority should reassess those tenants and adjust their differential rent accordingly. Local authorities have been requested to ensure that HAP tenants newly in receipt of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) supports be facilitated in remaining in their HAP tenancies. If amendments cannot be made immediately to a tenant&rsquo;s differential rent amount, any arrears accumulating from the date of approval of the new DEASP support should be rectified at a later date.This will not affect the HAP payment to the landlord.</p><p>The DEASP Rent Supplement scheme continues to play a key role in supporting families and individuals in private rented accommodation, with the scheme currently supporting approximately 21,150 recipients. The scheme provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme ensures that renters experiencing a temporary loss of employment during the COVID-19 emergency can continue to meet their rental commitments.</p><p>Since the introduction of the Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 emergency response approximately, 6,400 customers have been provided Rent Supplement support; in addition, there are currently, approximately, 1,500 pending applications awaiting a decision or in the process of providing the necessary documentation to the officer dealing with their claim. The DEASP response to the COVID-19 emergency has ensured the flexibility of the Rent Supplement scheme via specific measures to prevent undue delays in processing applications despite the large number of new cases received over a relatively short timeframe. The 2/3 day turnaround of applications ensures that customers do not build up rent arrears and officers attempt to ensure that a person's rental obligations are met in full. </p><p>The DEASP Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by providing assistance to those whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  There are several payments within the scheme including once-off exceptional needs payments (ENPs) which can cover rent arrears. </p><p>Where a person has a change of circumstances, such as a loss of income, they should notify the relevant local authority in the case of a HAP claim, or the DEASP for Rent Supplement to assess the level of any payment that can be made.</p></reply>

Further work is being carried out in the coming days and weeks to determine which actions will take place in each phase. Updates to the roadmap can be found at www.gov.ie.  Organisations should review the Roadmap and the updates carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures. Based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures. It is not necessary for organisations  to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The<b></b>National Return to Work Safely Protocol<b></b>is a useful guide for organisations in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers, employees and artists  the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. Further guidance is available from the Health and Safety Authority which is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace. The HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie.</p><p>With regards to the reopening of arts and cultural centres, the Theatre Forum has published guidelines for the reopening of arts centres and these have been welcomed by the Arts Council.  These guidelines which can be accessed here www.theatreforum.ie/assets/uploads/Re-opening-Arts-Centres_Doc-v.1.1.pdf should assist arts centres and other cultural facilities throughout the country to consider how they might prepare to re-open under totally changed circumstances. The guidelines recognise arts centres as places of work for artists, and as places for audiences to participate and engage with the arts.</p><p>The Arts Council has established a short-term Advisory Group to identify ways to address impacts of the Covid-19 Crisis on the sector. This group brings together a number of leading voices from the arts and other sectors and will report to the Arts Council on measures to sustain the arts sector through the current challenging period including the challenges posed by reopening.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently published guidelines for the tourism sector in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap and which were prepared in consultation with the tourism industry and relevant authorities. These guidelines are intended to assist tourism businesses including some theatres to meet requirements in line with the Return to Work Safely protocol and based on the latest health advice. The report can be accessed at this link: .</p><p>On 20th May my colleagues the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Shane Ross and Minister of State for Tourism and Sport, Brendan Griffin TD, announced the formation of a special Tourism Recovery Taskforce.  The Taskforce is charged with preparing a Tourism Recovery Plan for submission to the Minister which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023.</p><p>More generally, in light of the challenges faced by the arts and culture sector, the Taoiseach and I today  announced &euro;25 million in extra supports to help the Arts and Culture sector recover from the Covid19 Emergency in 2020.  The funding will include bursaries and commissions to artists and arts organisations, and resources for museums and culture workers as they prepare for the re-opening of society. This is additional to  funding previously allocated to the sector.</p><p>A total of &euro;20 million will be allocated to the Arts Council bringing its allocation this year to &euro;100 million.  A further &euro;5 million will be available for other measures, including securing the future of key cultural and museum spaces and facilities throughout Ireland, and the production of high-quality digital art and on-line performances.</p><p>In addition to all of these measures, my Department and the Department of an Taoiseach will also convene a meeting of relevant representatives from the public and private sector to discuss how to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector through the Covid19 recovery and beyond, recognising that the issues faced by venues as well as artists in an era where mass gatherings are restricted, are unique and will be problematic for quite some time. </p></reply>

Future plans include connecting<b></b>Castle Saunderson to Clonfad, thereby linking the town of Clones by navigable waterway to the Erne system. </p><p>Waterways Ireland is also continuing to work with its local authority partners to develop 22km of greenway along the Ulster Canal from Smithborough, Co. Monaghan to Middletown, Co. Armagh.</p><p>Work is currently on-going  to prepare for a planning application. An Ulster Canal Greenway strategy has been produced by Waterways Ireland and its partners which sets out how this greenway could become the spine of a network of off-road  greenways across this rural border region.</p><p>The project is progressing incrementally, as resources allow, and options for moving to the next phases are being considered.</p></reply>

Further work is being carried out in the coming days and weeks to determine which actions will take place in each phase. Updates to the roadmap can be found at www.gov.ie.  Organisations should review the Roadmap and the updates carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures. Based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures. It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p>  <p>  The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a guide for organisations in making assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers, employees and artists the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. Further guidance is available from the Health and Safety Authority which is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace. The HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie.</p>  <p>  With regards to the reopening of places of arts tuition as referred to by the Deputy, the Theatre Forum has published guidelines for the reopening of arts centres and these have been adopted by the Arts Council for all arts organisations and disciplines.  The guidelines recognise arts centres as places of work for artists, and as places for audiences to participate and engage with the arts.  The guidelines are available at this link https://www.theatreforum.ie/assets/uploads/Re-opening-Arts-Centres_Doc-v.1.1.pdf. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Education and Skills is engaging with education partners and relevant stakeholders which include representatives of students, parents, school staff, school leadership and management bodies on planning arrangements for the re-opening of schools in accordance with the timeframe outlined in above &ndash;mentioned  Government&rsquo;s Roadmap. </p>  <p>  The Arts Council has established a short-term Advisory Group to identify ways to address impacts of the Covid-19 Crisis on the sector. This group brings together a number of leading voices from the arts and other sectors and will report to the Arts Council on measures to sustain the arts sector through the current challenging period including the challenges posed by reopening.  I understand that the Group will complete their work shortly and I look forward to receiving their report.</p></reply>

This is additional to  funding previously allocated to the sector.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;20 million will be allocated to the Arts Council bringing its allocation this year to &euro;100 million.  A further &euro;5 million will be available for other measures, including securing the future of key cultural and museum spaces and facilities throughout Ireland, and the production of high-quality digital art and on-line performances.</p></reply>
