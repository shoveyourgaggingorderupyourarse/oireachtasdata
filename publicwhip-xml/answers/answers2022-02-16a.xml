In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland 2025 strategy, I also place a high importance on engaging actively with fellow Heads of State and Government, both within the EU and more widely. I also use international visits to promote Ireland&rsquo;s trade, culture, investment and enterprise interests, as well as to engage with Irish communities and to hear at first hand their experiences and concerns. On my visits I am usually accompanied by a small delegation, comprising senior officials/advisors and private office staff, according to the particular requirements of the programme.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on foreign travel, including the destination and costs, for myself, advisers and senior officials who travel with me, as well as costs related to the Government Chief Whip and Minister of State are published on a monthly basis on my Department&rsquo;s website under the heading Foreign Travel Reports. My officials will send details of the web address to the Deputy. All necessary expenditure on official travel such as flights, hotel accommodation, rail tickets, bus and taxi fares, ground transport and subsistence payments are in line with my Department's Travel Policy which is based on guidelines laid down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Department seeks at all times to ensure best value for money is sought in respect of each official trip undertaken, consistent with the requirements of official business.</p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999.In line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014. Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. Each such company has its own business model and approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base.</p><p>  The CRU, as the Deputy will appreciate, is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister. I have no function in these matters.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on general energy regulatory matters to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

Approximately 2.1 million domestic electricity accounts will benefit from the scheme for a one-off, exceptional payment. The scheme will apply to every domestic electricity account. </p><p>  In order to utilise the existing electricity billing infrastructure to enable payments to be made at the earliest possible opportunity in 2022, the single eligibility criterion of a meter point registration number will be used for this scheme, This criterion does not indicate the type of occupancy at each premises. The scheme will become operational following the passing of underpinning legislation, the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill, through the Oireachtas. </p><p>  The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will be charged with oversight of the scheme. The scheme will be operated by the Distribution System Operator (ESB Networks) because of its existing interface with all electricity suppliers. ESB Networks will make payments to energy suppliers, who in turn will credit all their domestic electricity account holders with a payment to the value of &euro;200 (inclusive of VAT).</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that regular information updates, including frequently asked questions, are being made available on gov.ie at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ae14-electricity-costs-emergency-benefit-scheme/.</p></reply>

These schemes have terms and conditions in place to ensure the transparent administration of public monies. Achieving this requires that the processes and systems are clear and efficient and operate in a manner which is fair to all applicants.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers free energy upgrades for eligible homeowners in low income households who are most at risk of energy poverty.  A range of home energy improvements can be funded under this scheme. The upgrades that are recommended for any given property depend on many factors including age, size, type and condition of the property. Each eligible home is assessed on a case-by-case basis by SEAI&rsquo;s managing agent. This involves a survey of the home which determines the upgrades that can be installed and funded. The home is subsequently allocated to a contractor who carries out a further assessment of the property to confirm the initial recommendation. A programme of work is then agreed between the contractor and SEAI. Decisions in relation to the recommended upgrades made by both SEAI&rsquo;s managing agent and contractors are informed by a technical operations manual.</p>  <p>  Applications under SEAI schemes are an operational matter for the SEAI.  As Minister, I have no function with regard to individual grant applications. SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members so that such queries can be addressed promptly, in line with SEAI&rsquo;s objective to deliver services to the highest standards.

Under the scheme 50% grant funding was available for homes that carried out retrofit to an A rating and replaced fossil fuel heating systems with heat pumps and renewables, with 95% support available for people at risk of energy poverty. The pilot has provided detailed information on the types of upgrades and technologies suited to particular homes, the costs associated with deeper retrofit, post works energy performance of homes retrofitted as well as customer and contractor experience of undertaking deeper retrofit projects. A key requirement of the scheme was that applications came from service providers rather than homeowners and involved at least 5 homes.</p>  <p>  Last week the Government launched a package of supports in line with commitments in the National Retrofit Plan.

This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors to deliver the work; and quality assuring the work. </p>  <p>  Homes, built and occupied pre-2011, and owned by private homeowners, non-corporate landlords and Approved Housing Bodies are eligible for the scheme. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for people all over Ireland to upgrade to a warmer, healthier and more comfortable home, with lower energy bills.</p>  <p>  In addition to the establishment of the new scheme, Government has also made clear that it is important that households that want or need to carry out the upgrade over time, should be supported at the enhanced grant levels. For that reason, many of the new grant rates are also now available under the Better Energy Homes Scheme allowing homeowners to take a step-by-step approach or self-manage the project.</p>  <p>  Window and door replacements are available under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme as well as under the Community Energy Grant scheme as part of a whole house upgrade solution, because in these instances they tend to be required to achieve an energy efficient home to B2. </p>  <p>  Window and door replacement are also available in some circumstances under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme which delivers free upgrades to eligible homeowners in low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.</p>  <p>  Window and door replacements are not supported as individual measures and as such are not available under the Better Energy Homes Scheme.</p>  <p>  Retrofitting our housing stock is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s plans for economic growth and development. I expect the unprecedented &euro;8 billion of National Development Plan funding available to support residential upgrades to 2030 will stimulate the creation of high-quality jobs throughout the country. It will also have a significant multiplier effect, supporting the development of associated supply chains. </p>  <p>  The recently published report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs indicated that the number of workers carrying out retrofits will need to increase from approximately 4,000 in 2021 to 17,000 by the middle of the decade.  In this regard the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has provided &euro;17 million to support 4,550 places on Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) and retrofit related courses this year. NZEB and retrofit programmes are provided in retrofit centres of excellence in Waterford Wexford ETB, Laois Offaly ETB and Mount Lucas National Construction Training Centre with work ongoing to establish a further three retrofit centres of excellence in Cork, Limerick/Clare and Mayo/Sligo/Leitrim ETBs.</p></reply>

There are no costs to the Exchequer or consumers for the CEG. </p><p>  The Government approved the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) on 21 December 2021, targeting 380MW of new generation from renewables self-consumers to contribute to an overall target for solar PV of 2.5GW by 2030 under the Climate Action Plan. The scheme design was supported by detailed economic and policy analysis carried out by Ricardo AEA which informed a public consultation on the draft design in January 2021 and is available on the gov.ie website.</p><p>  Finally, my Department is developing a policy design for a small-scale generation support scheme. This will be progressed in 2022 and is expected to become available in 2023. The design of this scheme will be informed by a report on policy options, including a cost analysis for a range of archetypes of solar PV generation, which has been commissioned by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and is due later this year.</p></reply>

Poor insulation, draughts and single glazing will affect the performance of a heat pump system. On this basis, one of the requirements for a dwelling to qualify for an SEAI grant for a heat pump system is that the dwelling has low heat loss. Some homes will already meet this requirement and other homes can achieve it through a package of upgrades. As such, the cost can vary significantly. Estimates compiled for the Department indicate that the cost to retrofit the fabric of a house to a BER B2 and install a heat pump can range between &euro;14,000 and &euro;66,000. </p>  <p>  The design for the upgrade carried out by the One Stop Shop will include appropriate upgrade measures to ensure the home has low heat loss. Grants are available for measures that can help a home achieve the required heat loss indicator, such as roof, wall and floor insulation, and window and door replacements. The grants have been set at levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard (up from 30%-35% grants currently).</p></reply>

The compromise text agreed at ECOFIN in December has been amended significantly in comparison to the original proposal so the EU Parliament will once again be consulted for their opinion.</p>  <p>  Once the Parliament has issued its opinion on the proposal, the Council will formally adopt the directive. Once the directive has been adopted it will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and, in line with the text of the proposal will enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. If the text remains unchanged, the transposition required by the proposal must be completed by 31 December 2024. </p>  <p>  However, even without this transposition, Member States may rely on the proposal to amend their VAT Rates from when it enters into force, on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will be reviewing the options now available to Ireland in setting VAT rates alongside their colleagues in Revenue. Future tax changes are generally taken in the context of the Budget. Deputies will be aware that my officials prepare a series of papers containing tax options for the Tax Strategy Group to be considered in the context of the budgetary process, alongside a wide range of submissions from various stakeholders and lobby groups.</p></reply>

The latest QFA statistics show that Irish private sector debt stood at &euro;808bn in Q3 2021. As a proportion of GDP, private sector debt continues to decline and stood at 197 per cent in Q3 2021. </p>  <p>  Private sector debt is broken down into the debt of Non-Financial Corporations (NFCs) and Households. In the case of NFCs, total debt stood at &euro;680bn at Q3 2021. As a proportion of GDP, NFC debt stood at 166%, its lowest level since 2008. It should also be noted that the QFA is compiled for the NFC sector on an aggregate level and a further breakdown of NFC debt by financial institution is not published.</p>  <p>  Household debt stood at &euro;128bn or &euro;25,568 per capita in Q3 2021, a decrease of 37% from its peak in Q3 2008. As a percentage of household disposable income, household debt stood at 100 per cent in Q3 2021, an all-time series low. </p>  <p>  In terms of debt arrears, the Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossession Statistics (available at www.centralbank.ie/statistics/data-and-analysis/credit-and-banking-statistics/mortgage-arrears) indicate there were 60,971 accounts in mortgage arrears of 30 days or more as at end-Q3 2021, with 47,681 accounts relating to Principal Dwelling House (PDHs), and 13,110 relating to Buy-to-lets (BTLs). The total arrears balance was &euro;2.83bn, with &euro;2.74bn relating to PDH accounts.</p>  <p>  Focussing on loans held by retail banks, the Non-Performing Loan ratio for lending to businesses was 8 per cent in 2021q3. </p>  <p>  On debt arrears broken down by individual financial institution, this information is not publically available from the Central Bank of Ireland, but to the extent this information is available it would be disclosed in the accounts of the relevant institutions. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank does not currently have direct analysis published on the issue of potential increase in repayment burdens or arrears resulting from increases in interest rates. However, the recent Financial Stability Review highlights that half of the balances owed by Irish SMEs to the retail banks have fixed interest rates, meaning that sudden interest rate rises would only impact borrowing costs if or when loan facilities are renewed. In addition, a growing number of households have short-term fixed interest rates, which will provide initial protection against potential interest rate rises. </p>  <p>  To help ensure the sustainability of the macroeconomic environment, the Department monitors interest rate developments on an ongoing basis. As part of both the Budget and the Stability Programme Update, baseline interest rate expectations are incorporated into the forecasts. In additional the Department has also previously simulated the impact of different stylised shocks, such as interest rate shocks, as part of the sensitivity analysis of the forecasts.  The most recent published example is in Budget 2020, which included a hypothetical monetary policy shock that assumed the ECB policy rate increases by 1 percentage point.</p></reply>

It is a voluntary tool aimed primarily for use by financial services firms and large companies.</p>  <p>  The European Commission adopted a Delegated Act on 2 February 2022 which included standards that nuclear and natural gas power production must meet, particularly in terms of emissions and other environmental impacts, to be considered sustainable. After this adoption, the Act can no longer be amended, and Council and the European Parliament have four months to object. Rejection of the Act requires a reinforced qualified majority (75% of Member States) at Council or a majority at the European Parliament. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan acknowledges that we will use natural gas as part of our energy mix, particularly as a base reserve to provide supply when renewables are unable to meet demand so as to provide consumers and businesses with the confidence to electrify. This consideration applies for other Member States also. However, it does not necessarily follow that all activities necessary to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 should be included in the Taxonomy and Ireland expressed this view to the Commission in advance of the Commission adopting their delegated act. </p>  <p>  To be clear, including something (such as nuclear energy generation) in the Taxonomy will not mean it must be used and excluding it from the taxonomy will not prohibit its use. It is, however, likely to affect investment decisions by financial market participants. The generation of energy from nuclear power is statute-barred in Ireland and the Government has no plans to revisit this legislative prohibition.</p></reply>

As of September 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;387 million, an increase of 19% year-on-year.  </p><p>Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). I am pleased to share with the Deputy that three credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to AHBs. </p><p><b>SME Lending </b></p><p>Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). The BILS provides low-cost loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses. </p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 6.9% year on year to end September 2021.  Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. </p><p><b>Access to Finance for Retrofit </b></p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit. My officials have been engaging with stakeholders to support increased credit union participation in retrofit loan schemes.  </p><p><b>Other Services</b></p><p>Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must receive approval from the Central Bank.  </p><p>66 credit unions are approved to provide current accounts.  </p><p>The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without requiring approval. The Central Bank is undertaking a review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape. The Central Bank has commenced a public consultation seeking views from stakeholders on the proposed changes arising from this review.</p></reply>

The amount on which VAT is chargeable, in accordance with section 37(1) of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, is the total consideration receivable by the supplier, &ldquo;including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever&rdquo; but not including the VAT itself. </p>  <p>  In this respect, in the case of a gas bill, which includes carbon tax, VAT law dictates that VAT should be calculated on the carbon tax element of the bill as well as the charge for the service. Similarly, where an electricity bill includes the PSO levy, VAT is charged on the full amount of the charge to the customer, which includes the PSO levy.  The same situation applies in the case of other excises, including for example excises on petrol, auto-diesel, tobacco and alcohol products, where the VAT charged on these goods is also charged on the excise value.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-16a.151.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021600070#WRD01100"><p>The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.</p>  <p>  In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (10th February) by EWSS is over &euro;7.4 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;6.4 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;1 billion to 51,900 employers in respect of over 713,500 employees. </p>  <p>  To be eligible for EWSS an employer must be able to demonstrate that its business has experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, the Government agreed the future of EWSS including its graduated exit strategy. These arrangements were subsequently enhanced in response to the public health situation, namely the extension of the enhanced rates of subsidy for a further two months (across December 2021 and January 2022) and the reopening of the scheme for certain businesses as announced on 9 and 21 December 2021 respectively.</p>  <p>  From 1 February 2022, for most businesses, including the taxi sector, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p>  <p>  For completeness and in the event that persons in the taxi sector are operating as a sole-trader, I would clarify that subject to meeting the requisite conditions, a sole-trader&rsquo;s business may be a qualifying employer for the purpose of the scheme, the same as is the case for any other employer. As was the case under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), sole-traders are not able to claim the EWSS in respect of their own employment as they are not employees &ndash; and further, may not necessarily be paid via the payroll system unlike proprietary directors who are obliged to have PAYE operated on any payments made to them personally. </p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware on 21 January 2022, I announced that businesses availing of EWSS that were directly impacted by the public health regulations of December 2021 will continue to receive the enhanced rates of subsidy for the month of February and the graduated step-down in subsidy rates will be delayed by one month with such firms continuing to receive support under the scheme until 31 May 2022. The relevant public health regulations of late December last imposed an 8pm closing time on hospitality venues, including restaurants, bars and cafes, and reduced capacity on many indoor events, thus directly curtailing the ability of the businesses to trade. </p></reply>

If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff. </p>  <p>  This policy is outlined in detail in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 10/2021, which is available here: www.gov.ie/en/circular/e3bc7-instruction-on-the-pension-increase-policy-in-the-public-service-until-end-2022/ </p>  <p>  My officials have checked the position regarding the payment of pension increases related to the 1 October pay increase with the National Shared Services Office (NSSO), which is responsible for the administration of civil service pensions.

The tax will replace the Vacant Site Levy. </p>  <p>  The significant benefit of the tax is to incentivise the development of suitably zoned land across the State which has been the beneficiary of investment in servicing for housing construction.  This includes lands in cities, towns and village centres which are vacant or idle where such lands are zoned for mixed use including residential. The tax measure, in conjunction with the ongoing review of development plans throughout the State to identify and zone housing land needed to meet statutory Housing Supply Targets will ensure that delivery of housing on zoned and serviced land is progressed. The tax will, when it comes into effect in 2024, be applied at an annual taxation rate of 3% of market value of the land to encourage use for appropriate development.</p>  <p>  The tax will apply to all land zoned for residential or a mix of uses including residential and which are serviced throughout all 31 local authorities, with certain lands excluded from scope. The role of the local authorities is to identify the lands in scope via a mapping process commencing November 2022, which includes appeal provisions where the relevant landowner considers that a parcel of land does not meet the criteria for falling within the scope of the tax. After the publication of the final maps in December 2023, the tax will be managed by the Revenue Commissioners. The maps will be reviewed annually by local authorities to ensure they are up to date. The tax will remain as a charge on the land, will be applied annually and will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners, incentivising the development of the land-bank by the owners, or the sale of the land to those who will undertake development.  </p>  <p>  The criteria for inclusion on the map is land zoned in a Development Plan or Local Area Plan solely or primarily for residential use, or for a mixture of uses that includes residential use, where such lands are able to connect to the necessary infrastructure to enable housing development and for which there is capacity available. Zoned land subject to known issues relating to contamination or the presence of known archaeological or historic remains are to be excluded. There are certain exemptions specific to either residential or mixed use serviced land. For residential zoned land, these involve commercial uses which provide a service to the surrounding area and are liable for commercial rates. For lands zoned for a mixture of uses, including residential, the focus is on lands which are vacant or idle and not integral to any unauthorised use of the lands. All other land use zonings are not within the scope of the tax. Existing dwellings and their gardens, while they will be included in the maps, are not included in the scope of the tax.  </p>  <p>  Landowners may also make submissions to local authorities during the public consultation periods on the maps to amend zonings to remove their lands from the scope of the tax, which could also reflect those lands which are not attracting development interest. In considering these submissions and the potential for varying the adopted development plan as a result, the local authorities must take into account the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and the need to zone sufficient land to meet the statutory Housing Supply Targets.  </p>  <p>  My Department notified all local authorities of the introduction of the tax measure on signing of the Finance Act 2021. My Department is preparing guidance on the mapping process and the management of rezoning requests and is liaising with stakeholders through a working group.  Financial support and assistance to the local authorities will also be provided on this matter to ensure that the maps will be published as required by the legislation. My Department will bring forward separate transitionary legislation to repeal the vacant site levy arrangements and this will take account of lands that might otherwise fall out of the full scope of the Vacant Site Levy, that are currently subject to the Vacant Site Levy.</p></reply>

to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects and recognises that this requires the resourcing of the housing services of local authorities.  Last year, my Department worked closely with local authorities, through the County and City Management Association (CCMA) and the Housing Delivery Coordination Office, to identify capacity constraints and additional staffing resources required to deliver the social housing delivery targets set out in Housing for All.  Following this analysis, I approved over 200 new posts for local authorities.</p><p>The requests from all local authorities for additional housing department staff on foot of the announced new positions are detailed in the following tables, showing the data

Its objective is to provide public off-site infrastructure to relieve critical infrastructure blockages to housing delivery. This enables the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in Dublin and in urban areas of high demand. LIHAF was designed to specifically address the issue of housing supply, a crucial factor in terms of moderating house prices. Infrastructure being funded under LIHAF includes access roads, distributor roads, link roads, road improvements, roundabouts, bridges and parks. </p>  <p>  In 2017, grant agreements for 30 approved projects were signed between my Department and local authorities. One such project is at Maynooth, Co. Kildare. Kildare County Council were approved grant funding for the construction of the Maynooth Eastern Relief Road (MERR) and a bridge crossing a railway and the Royal Canal. The total approved grant funding for this project is &euro;14.5m with &euro;10.88m (75%) being funded by my Department and the remaining 25% being funded by Kildare County Council. To date, Kildare County Council have drawn down &euro;770,000 in exchequer funding for project costs associated with this LIHAF project.</p>  <p>  I understand that detailed design of the MERR is at an advanced stage and developers are currently engaged in the planning process for the delivery of housing units on LIHAF lands. Kildare County Council are liaising with a diverse number of stakeholders including my Department to advance the MERR project.</p></reply>

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to that person.  In order to meet this requirement, each passport applicant must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement when making a first time passport application. </p><p>An individual born on the island of Ireland before 2005 or born to a parent who was born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is automatically an Irish citizen.</p><p>The citizenship of persons born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is determined by the citizenship or residency status of one of their parents at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth. In the circumstances outlined by the Deputy in which both parents are non-Irish citizens, if neither of the parents are a British citizen, the citizenship of a child born in Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is determined by the residency status of one of the parents at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth. A child born on or after 1 January 2005 may claim citizenship by birth where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding his/her birth (a total of 1,095 days). </p><p>In order to prove this residency period of one of the parents when applying for a passport on behalf of their child, the parent must provide acceptable documentary evidence. The documents required to prove the residency period vary depending on whether the parent was an EU or non-EU citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth. </p><p>If the parent was an EU citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, it is necessary to rely on the following list of documents to prove the parent&rsquo;s residency in Ireland for three of the four years before the child&rsquo;s birth (not all of the documents on the list may be required in every case):</p><p>- Tax records (P60 / P45 / P35L / Employment Detail Summary) for each yearshowing at least 35 weeks insurable employment.  </p><p>- Notice of Assessment / Self Assessment records for each year and supportingdocumentation e.g. bank statements / domestic bills for each month</p><p>- Letter from Social Welfare/Intreo confirming type of benefit payment received andthe dates to and from when the benefit was paid directly, this must beaccompanied by a photocopy of parent&rsquo;s PPS card front and back</p><p>- Rent Lease (must include contract page and signature of the parent whoseresidency is being considered) with receipts / utility bills/ rent book toconfirm payments for each month</p><p>- Bank statementsfor each month showing regular transactions in and out of the account</p><p>- School/college letters confirming dates of attendance, full time courses undertaken and proofof exam results</p><p>- Declaration Form A: This is a sworn statement by the parent, giving details of their period ofresidency in Ireland. </p><p>If neither of the parents was an Irish, British or EU citizen at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth, one of the parents will be required to provide proof of residency in Ireland for three of the four years before the child&rsquo;s birth with the following original documents:</p><p>- Original national passport of the parent showing residency stamps for 3 of theprevious 4 years before the child is born. Expired passports can besubmitted.</p><p>- Parent&rsquo;s Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) card / Irish ResidencePermit (IRP) card.</p><p>- A summary statement, signed by parent of parent&rsquo;s &lsquo;permission to remain&rsquo;stamps in the passport. The summary should include:</p><p>- Number of the passport.</p><p>- Name of passport holder.</p><p>- Description of the stamp(s).</p><p>- Dates of the permission.</p><p>In addition to the documents outlined above, all first time child applications require the submission of:</p><p>- Guardianship documents (if required). </p><p>- Full original civil birth certificate.</p><p>Information on what is required for all first time passport applications, including details on documentary requirements, guardianship and consent, are available at my Department&rsquo;s recently updated website (<i>www.dfa.ie/passports/documentary-requirements/</i>). </p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this:</p><p>- As outlined above, it is important for the Passport Service to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5<sup>th</sup>in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries. This is something we can all be proud of. However, in order to maintain this ranking and to protect theintegrity of the Irish passport, the Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. </p><p>- In the case of children, it is essential that the Passport Service verifies the consent of the child&rsquo;s guardians before a passport can issue. This ensures that the Passport Service protects the rights of the child and their guardians.</p><p>Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 40 working days to process. In cases of children whose parents are not Irish citizens, the process can sometimes take longer due to the need to ensure that all of the required supporting documentation to prove the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is submitted and correct.  Due to the high level of complexity with these particular applications, further documentation is often required adding to the processing time.</p><p>I strongly urge parents to carefully read the documentary requirements on my Department&rsquo;s website and to apply for passports for their children online in plenty of time. Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA.</p></reply>

These further extensive changes to the examinations, additional to adjustments announced in August 2021, took account of the disruption to teaching and learning experienced by the Leaving Certificate class of 2022. The decision to make these changes to the examination papers has been taken to provide the Leaving Certificate students of 2022 with certainty and clarity. The changes will provide the fairest pathway to successfully completing their post-primary education and enabling them to progress to further and higher education and training, apprenticeships and the world of work. The changes are the same as those that were implemented in March 2021 for Leaving Certificate 2021. They are designed to cater for a range of different absence scenarios experienced by students as a result of the impact of Covid-19, while ensuring that the overall familiar structure of the examinations remains intact. Full details of the further changes made to the examinations are published on <i>gov.ie/leavingcertificate</i>and on <i>www.examinations.ie</i>. They have been notified to schools, who have been requested to communicate them to students. </p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p><p>My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,200 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. </p><p>There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. Most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025 and are being progressed as quickly as possible.</p><p>This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>During the period 2018 to 2021 691 school building projects were completed under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).  These projects delivered in excess of 64,000 school places. </p><p>Overall there are currently 30 schools with ongoing projects at various stages of planning, design and in construction in the <b>Newcastle_Rathcoole, Clondalkin_D22, Lucan and Palmerstown_Ronanstown_D20 school planning areas.</b>These projects, listed below are being progressed through the various stages of assessment and delivery.</p><p>The length of time a project takes to deliver depends on a number of factors, including scale and complexity, and is subject to the time it takes to progress through the statutory approval process.

New schools are only established in areas of demographic growth as the resources available for school infrastructure have to be prioritised to meet the needs of areas of significant population increase so as to ensure that every child has a school place.  </p>  <p>  The arrangements also give an opportunity to patrons to apply for the patronage of new schools. The criteria used in deciding on the patronage of new schools place a particular emphasis on parental patronage and language preferences and an analysis of existing provision in the areas where the schools are being established.</p>  <p>  This approach is underpinned by a 2011 Government Decision.</p>  <p>  The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been in operation under my Department since 2018 and provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.   </p>  <p>  A prospective patron can chose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to my Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents can then access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (with the exception of the Irish-medium primary gaelscoileanna which have been designated as Irish-medium prior to the opening of the OPPS - in the case of these schools, parents can select their preferred patron).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.   </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). This Group was set up in 2011 to advise the Minister on the patronage of new schools.

It will not be available for hair loss due to ageing or other natural causes. </p>  <p>  The grant of up to &euro;500 will be available once every calendar year to support people towards the cost of non-surgical hair replacement, for example wigs and toup&eacute;es. </p>  <p>  Hair loss is a common issue among people that can be caused by a variety of medical conditions including autoimmune diseases such as alopecia or systemic conditions like cancer. I recognise not only the physical impact, but also the psychological impact, that hair loss can have on a person&rsquo;s life. This new grant should help improve the quality of life of those who need it. </p>  <p>  Approximately 2.25 million people qualify for Treatment Benefit, but it is difficult to estimate the level of take-up of this new benefit. For example, 25,000 people get diagnosed with invasive cancer annually and up to 2,000 of them may apply for the grant. The estimated cost of the new grant is &euro;1 million per year.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently addressing requirements for providers and claimants. The details will be available in advance of the introduction of the grant.</p>  <p>  The terms of the new grant are aligned with the equivalent HSE scheme for medical card holders, which does not cover the loss of eyebrows and eye lashes.

This marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p><p>The Expert Group report informed the transformative package of measures for the sector committed in Budget 2022, including the new Core Funding stream. Core Funding will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability. </p><p>Core Funding will be available to registered early learning and childcare providers, including full day care providers, ECCE-only providers, and stand-alone school-age providers, subject to the service agreeing to come into contract for the scheme. It will be a payment directly to services who choose to participate in the scheme. </p><p>The total available budget for Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full programme year, contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee. Core Funding will be allocated to services based on their capacity and the qualifications of those working in a service in line with the following three elements, with the majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;172 million of the &euro;207 million) distributed via the first of these elements: </p><p><b>Main Base Rate</b></p><p>Number of child places in an age group * Value based on ratio that applies to age group * Hours of operation per week * Weeks open per year </p><p><b>Graduate Lead Educator Uplift </b></p><p>Applied at room level, scaling in line with hours per week and weeks per year group is operating (Maximum one Graduate Lead Educator uplift per ELC room)</p><p><b>Graduate Manager Uplift</b></p><p>Applied at service level, scaling in line with hours per week and weeks per year service is operating (Maximum one Graduate Manager uplift per service)</p><p>Higher levels of funding will be available for capacity for younger children, to support the higher operating costs for these children arising from the higher staff ratio requirements. </p><p>Participation in Core Funding for early learning and childcare will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates in return for the increased State funding. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Services will also be required to offer the NCS and/or the ECCE programme to all eligible children/parents, in line with their operations.</p><p>Services will also be invited to report on the quality development measures they are pursuing.</p><p>A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding will be available in early March along with further communications to the sector about the funding and the full contract requirements. </p><p>In the interim period, until April 2022, Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare employers continue to be eligible to access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which has provided very substantial investment in the sector since August 2020.  Following the cessation of EWSS, ELC and SAC providers will have access to a Transition Fund between May and August in advance of the introduction of Core Funding from September.</p><p>The level of investment being made available for Core Funding is an acknowledgement that high quality early learning and childcare costs more than the current income to the sector. </p><p>The aim of Core Funding is to allow providers&rsquo; costs to increase to improve quality but to ensure these costs are not passed onto parents in fees and that services are not made unsustainable.  </p><p>This is the start of a multi-annual investment plan and is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model.  </p></reply>

Under the Regulations, the number of places a service can offer depends on the size of rooms and the age of the children. It also depends on the number of staff present, with staff:child ratio requirements linked to the age of children. Services will declare the capacity they offer and a Core Funding value will be calculated based on that capacity.  A service&rsquo;s Core Funding will then scale depending on the opening hours and weeks of the service.</p>  <p>  The structure of Core Funding is based on the recommendations of the Expert Group on the new funding model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare. Structuring it in this way means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance. </p></reply>

Recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions, with for example the average pay for non-managerial staff being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021. </p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early years educators or school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p>  <p>  In December last, I published Nurturing Skills, the Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022 to 2028. Actions in Nurturing Skills to develop career pathways and promote careers in the sector will complement efforts to improve pay and conditions of employment, to make the sector more attractive to potential workers.</p>  <p>  One of the key pillars of Nurturing skills is raising qualification levels in the workforce. To achieve this objective, actions in the plan include providing funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) for early years educators and level 5 for SAC practitioners, and providing financial support to service providers to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave. My Department will be working collaboratively with both the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to deliver this objective.</p>  <p>  A key enabler for Nurturing Skills is the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services. I began a process in December 2020, which examined the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee, which began meeting in December 2021.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced a new Core Funding stream which, among other objectives, will support service providers to meet new higher rates of pay that may be negotiated through the Joint Labour Committee.</p>  <p>  I am also committed to supporting providers in responding to current challenges. Over recent weeks, a Sub-Group of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum was convened to discuss immediate staffing pressures resulting from COVID-19 and additional measures that may be needed.</p>  <p>  One proposal which was agreed is a temporary measure that was in place during December and January specifically to help services respond to COVID-19-related staffing shortages through the temporary employment of students on recognised courses of study who are deemed to have achieved the equivalent of a level 5 qualification in early learning and care.</p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the pressure that ELC and SAC providers are under regarding their operating costs. </p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I was pleased to announce that Government investment in ELC and SAC next year will reach &euro;716 million.</p><p>From September 2022, a major new funding stream - Core Funding - will be introduced. Under the new funding stream, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures. The funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain qualified staff; establish career structures; introduce or improve other features of provision that are demonstrated to contribute to quality (e.g. non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation). It is important to support services with staff costs, which comprise approximately 68% of a service's operating costs. Core Funding will also contribute to cost increases related to non-staff costs (for example, utilities, rent).</p><p>Core Funding will ensure that services remain sustainable in the context of a commitment not to increase fees. In a full year, &euro;207m will be available for providers under this new funding stream.</p><p>Budget 2022 also announced that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) would continue to be available to the ELC and SAC sector.  Employers in the sector have been entitled to access the EWSS, with an exemption from the requirement to demonstrate the 30% drop in turnover that applies to other sectors since August 2020. Between October 2020 and January 2022 the enhanced rate of EWSS equalled &euro;34 million, per month, for ELC providers, covering, on average, 80% staff costs or 50% total operating costs. </p><p>From 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week applies; this amounts to &euro;22 million per month for ELC providers, covering, on average, 50% staff costs or 38% total operating costs.</p><p>For March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022; this amounts of &euro;11 million per month in the sector, and will cover, on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs.</p><p>Between the end of the EWSS and the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund will be in place to support providers. The main conditionality of access to the Transition Fund will be that services do not increase the fees charged to parents above September 2021 levels. The sum paid to each service under the Transition Fund will depend on the service&rsquo;s capacity, location, and service type.</p><p>Where providers require further financial assistance in addition to current supports available, the Department operates a Covid-19 Impact Support Scheme. This is additional to the existing financial supports and is to support the sustainability of ELC and SAC services who may be left with short-term sustainability concerns due to lower attendance or higher costs arising from Covid-19. This scheme supports services to remain open without increasing fees to parents or guardians.</p><p>‎‎Sustainability Funding also continues to be available to providers where there are sustainability difficulties and I have requested that providers would exhaust this route before considering increases in fees for parents. I encourage providers to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee if they require any further information or support: <i>myccc.ie/</i>. </p></reply>

The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.</p>  <p>  Currently a universal subsidy of 50cents per hour is available for children up to three, for up to 45 hours per week and an income-assessed subsidy is available for children of all ages for up to 45 hours per week, the level of which is determined by the family&rsquo;s income.  </p>  <p>  Following Budget 2022, two significant reforms will be introduced to the operation of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) in the coming months. It is intended that these reforms will make it possible for significantly more families to benefit from the NCS.</p>  <p>  The first change is the discontinuation of the practice of deducting hours spent in ECCE or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from Spring 2022. With this change, parents will be able to avail of all NCS subsidised hours regardless of time spent in school or ECCE.   This will be of particular benefit in reducing the cost of after-school services to parents, which will in turn support the sustainability of community after-school services.</p>  <p>  The second reform relates to the universal subsidy. This will be made available to all families with children up to the age of 15 from September 2022. Parents do not have to undergo an assessment to avail of this subsidy. The universal subsidy provides &euro;0.50 cent per hour towards the cost of a registered place up to a maximum of 45 hours a week, which totals &euro;1,170 per annum.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, from September 2022, a major new Core Funding stream will be introduced. Under Core Funding providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase.  The commitment not to increase fees will ensure that the full affordability benefits of the ECCE programme and the NCS are felt by parents.</p>  <p>   &euro;69 million is being made available for Core Funding next year, equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year.  This is an estimated increase of 16% in the total annual income to the sector.</p>  <p>  In advance of the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund will be available to providers, also contingent on an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels.  This fund will operate between May and August 2022 between the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (April 2022) and the introduction of Core Funding (September 2022).</p>  <p>  This package marks the beginning of an important and transformative multi-annual investment programme.  It achieves significant progress on the commitment to increase spending on ELC and SAC and will deliver substantial improvements in affordability, quality, inclusion and sustainability.</p></reply>

The new funding model marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has ensured an additional &euro;78m for ELC and SAC, which will support my Department to introduce a range of new measures in the upcoming year. The Expert Group report informed this package of measures for the sector. The report emphasises the importance of a unified approach across the sector &ndash; both Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare &ndash; and this will be applied in the new funding model.</p>  <p>  Among these measures are reforms to the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), which will be of significant benefit to many parents. </p>  <p>  Specifically, the practice of deducting hours spent in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours will be discontinued in 2022. </p>  <p>  Where both parents in a household are in work or study, eligible families can receive a subsidy for up to 45 hours per week and, for households where a parent is not in work or study, they can receive up to 20 hours per week of subsidy. Currently, where a child is in ECCE or school, these hours are subtracted from their entitlement to NCS subsidised hours. </p>  <p>  With the change announced in Budget 2022, parents will be able to avail of all NCS subsidised hours regardless of time spent in school or ECCE. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that this will benefit an estimated 5,000 children from low-income families. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the NCS universal subsidy will be extended to all families with children under 15 years of age. This is a significant expansion of the NCS, as currently the universal subsidy is available to children between the ages of 24 weeks and 36 months, and is payable for a child who is older than 36 months but does not yet qualify for ECCE. The extension of the universal subsidy will benefit up to 40,000 children. </p>  <p>  These changes to the NCS were will increase the overall number of subsidised hours available to families with school-aged children, and may make SAC a more attractive option for parents.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a new Core Funding stream will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability. Core Funding will be available to registered ELC and SAC providers, including full day care providers, ECCE-only providers, and stand-alone school-age providers, subject to the service agreeing to come into contract for the scheme.</p>  <p>  The new Core Funding stream for both ELC and SAC services to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability and the establishment of an Employment Regulation Order, will be worth up to &euro;69 million in 2022 and up to &euro;207 million from 2023 on. Participation in Core Funding will require services not to increase fees to parents from the September 2021 rates.</p>  <p>  The calculation of the value of Core Funding to an individual provider will be predominantly based on the level of capacity that they commit to offering during the contract period, meaning providers will have a stable income source based on the service they deliver. The value of Core Funding to a provider will also depend on the qualifications of those working in the service.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund will be available to ELC and SAC services from May to August inclusive, to support services during the period between the phasing out of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in April and the introduction of the new Core Funding stream in September. </p>  <p>  The Expert Group's report also addressed the role that ELC and SAC can play in contributing to tackling disadvantage and made a series of recommendations on how the funding model can support this goal through a combination of universal and targeted measures for services operating in the context of disadvantage.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 began the implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations. Full implementation of all recommendations will be progressed in the coming years as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process.</p>  <p>  I would also add that the Department oversees a Case Management process through which local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to ELC and SAC services experiencing difficulties. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Financial supports, which may also be accessed through the Case Management process, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal. All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.</p></reply>

The primary conditionality attached to access the Transition Fund will be that providers do not increase their fees above levels charged in September 2021. </p><p>A weekly value will be determined for each service based on their location, size and service type.  Services will receive this funding in respect of the weeks during which they are open.  There will be a simple application process for providers which will be available in April.</p><p>The basis for calculating the Transition Fund will be different from the Revenue-administered EWSS. Further communications will issue to ELC and SAC providers in the coming weeks.</p><p>Budget 2022 also announced the new Core Funding stream. Core Funding will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability.</p><p>Core Funding will be available to registered ELC and SAC providers, including full day care providers, ECCE-only providers, and stand-alone school-age providers, subject to the service agreeing to come into contract for the scheme. It will be a payment directly to services who choose to participate in the scheme.</p><p>The total available budget for Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full programme year, contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee. Core Funding will be allocated to services based on their capacity and the qualifications of those working in a service in line with the following three elements, with the majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;172 million of the &euro;207 million) distributed via the first of these elements:</p><p><b>Main Base Rate</b></p><p>Number of child places in an age group * Value based on ratio that applies to age group * Hours of operation per week * Weeks open per year</p><p><b>Graduate Lead Educator Uplift</b></p><p>Applied at room level, scaling in line with hours per week and weeks per year group is operating (Maximum one Graduate Lead Educator uplift per ELC room)</p><p><b>Graduate Manager Uplift</b></p><p>Applied at service level, scaling in line with hours per week and weeks per year service is operating (Maximum one Graduate Manager uplift per service)</p><p>Higher levels of funding will be available for capacity for younger children, to support the higher operating costs for these children arising from the higher staff ratio requirements.</p><p>Participation in Core Funding for ELC and SAC providers will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates in return for the increased State funding. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Services will also be required to offer the NCS and/or the ECCE programme to all eligible children/parents, in line with their operations.</p><p>Services will also be invited to report on the quality development measures they are pursuing.</p><p>The values for places for children of different ages offered by a service take into account the regulatory requirements. Under the Regulations, the number of places a service can offer depends on the size of rooms and the age of the children. It also depends on the number of staff present, with staff:child ratio requirements linked to the age of children. Services will declare the capacity they offer and a Core Funding value will be calculated based on that capacity.  A service&rsquo;s Core Funding will then scale depending on the opening hours and weeks of the service.</p><p>The structure of Core Funding is based on the recommendations of the Expert Group on the new funding model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare. Structuring it in this way means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance. </p><p>Core Funding is designed to operate alongside the existing funding schemes, including the ECCE programme and the NCS, subject to enhancements including those outlined above. Therefore, the NCS will continue to provide subsidies for children in attendance and ECCE will continue to provide capitation.</p><p>A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding to their service will be available in early March along with further communications to the sector about the funding and the full contract requirements.</p><p>The level of investment being made available for Core Funding is an acknowledgement that high quality ELC and SAC costs more than the current income to the sector. The aim of Core Funding is to allow providers&rsquo; costs to increase to improve quality but to ensure these costs are not passed onto parents in fees and that services are not made unsustainable.  </p><p>This is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model. </p></reply>

In this regard I have scheduled a meeting with Minister O&rsquo;Brien this month to further this work.</p>  <p>  The EU Child Guarantee provides Ireland with an opportunity to re-focus and, where necessary, re-evaluate our approach in tackling child poverty and promoting children&rsquo;s well-being. The objective of the Guarantee is to prevent and combat social exclusion by guaranteeing access for children who are in need of a range of key services and as such forms a subset to the wider issues revolving around child poverty. </p>  <p>  The EU Child Guarantee calls on Member States to guarantee for children in need, free access to early childhood education and care; education (including school-based activities); and healthcare; and to ensure effective access to healthy nutrition, a healthy meal each school day and adequate housing. An online consultation in relation to the National Action Plan for the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee ran from 1st December 2021 until 14th January 2022.  Twenty-one submissions were received from various organisations, a synopsis of which was compiled and issued for further consideration by relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  As part of the obligations for Ireland under the Child Guarantee, DCEDIY is currently developing a National Action Plan for the Child Guarantee, in collaboration with a range of Government Departments. Responses from all relevant Departments are expected in the coming days. Following the refinement of text following inputs received, an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) will be convened to assist in the drafting and finalisation of the plan.</p>  <p>  The effective implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Future (BOBF) and its cross government and cross sectoral engagement will inform the implementation of the Child Guarantee National Action Plan to ensure it is collaborative, integrated and, ultimately, impactful. Identifying the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people will be a particular focus of work to define the implementation structures and processes.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is anticipated that Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan for the Child Guarantee will be published by March 2022 following Government approval, and submitted to the EU Commission.</p></reply>

I am committed to further strengthening and sustaining our efforts, building on achievements and addressing some of the enduring problems that adversely affect children's lives. </p>  <p>  My Department is now working on the successor national policy framework which will run from 2023-2028. On the 27th January, I  launched a public consultation giving children and young people, parents, practitioners and others working with children and young people, as well as the wider public, the opportunity to input into the successor framework. This consultation seeks general views on what is going well in children and young people's lives, and what is not going well. This is the first public consultation on the new framework, which will be followed by more targeted consultations in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  The new policy framework will be developed to incorporate the EU Child Guarantee National Action Plan, which I will bring to government shortly. The plan will address a number of critical matters: securing free access to early childhood education and care; education; healthcare for children in need; healthy nutrition; and adequate housing.  </p>  <p>  With a strong focus on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and having regard to the government's wellbeing framework, the new framework will be one which can promote social progress and better standards of life and deliver the special care and assistance due to all children, particularly the most vulnerable.</p></reply>

Following a competitive tender process in May, research commenced on this important work in June. The aims of the research include to:</p>  <p>  - Identify the various definitions and characteristics of parental alienation being used internationally.</p>  <p>  - Investigate what is known about the prevalence of this issue (in Ireland or internationally) through examination of the literature.</p>  <p>  - Identify and outline the various approaches and responses being taken in other jurisdictions to deal with the issue of parental alienation (legislative and otherwise).</p>  <p>  - Describe, outline and evaluate any studies which have examined the effectiveness of these various international approaches and assess the relevance of these studies to the Irish context.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that a draft report was received by my Department at the end of November and is now being reviewed. It is also my intention to commence a public consultation on the topic in the coming weeks. Both the research and consultation will, I expect, create a deeper understanding of the issue, and inform my Department&rsquo;s consideration of policy and law in this area. The best interests of the child will of course be paramount in any considerations. </p>  <p>  I recognise that going through the breakdown of a relationship can be a difficult and traumatic time for children and parents and that reform of the current family justice system is needed to better support families through such times. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes in specialised centres.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. This has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. Work is ongoing on the drafting of the Bill, with a view to its publication as soon as possible this year.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of finalising a Family Justice Strategy, which will set out a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. </p>  <p>  To develop the new strategy, a Family Justice Oversight Group was established by my Department. To assist its work, this Group has engaged in a phased consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look.</p>  <p>  One of the areas being considered by the Group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system. A number of other issues are being considered for inclusion in the emergent Family Justice Strategy, including the availability of and access to support services; the potential use of less adversarial approaches to the resolution of disputes, where possible and appropriate; information dissemination and awareness raising; and oversight of the implementation of any proposed reforms. </p></reply>

It is intended that this fund will support investment in projects which will improve community safety. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, will have an initial outlay in 2022 of &euro;2m.</p><p>It is important to note that the assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau are not surrendered to the Exchequer immediately. Under the Proceeds of Crime Acts, a court determination is required and a period of at least seven years must elapse before disposal of any asset for the benefit of the Exchequer. This time limit may be reduced if both parties consent, however, it is often the case that legal challenges increase the time between seizure and disposal. Further challenges are presented by virtual assets, such as cryptocurrency, that are not tied to a physical location.</p><p>  We must also recognise that seizures by CAB fluctuate. To tie the fund to the geographic area where the assets were seized would not provide a stable, steady, funding source. In addition, some CAB targets primarily operate in different areas to those in which they reside.</p><p>  With that in mind, money will be provided to the Community Safety Innovation Fund from the Central Fund of the Exchequer. This will allow projects to apply for funding that is available regardless of the area they operate in or the level of seizures by CAB in their locale.</p><p>A call for funding proposals will issue shortly seeking applications for community safety projects and similar initiatives from bodies involved in community safety, such as the new Local Community Safety Partnerships &ndash; pilots of which are in place in North Inner City Dublin, Waterford and Longford &ndash; and the Drogheda Implementation Board, as well as similar entities nationwide.</p><p>Applications will be assessed against stated criteria outlined in the call for proposals to ensure funding is allocated to encourage innovative ways to improve community safety from applicants who understand local community safety needs best.</p><p>These criteria for allocating funding are now finalised, with the fund due to be launched imminently. </p></reply>

The Bureau has staff drawn from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (including Customs), the Department of Social Protection and my Department.</p><p>The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target assets, wherever situated, which derive or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction &ndash; disrupting the activities of criminal gangs through the removal of their ill-gotten gains - and has been recognised as a world leader in asset investigations, tracing and forfeiture. </p><p>The Bureau works closely with Garda&iacute; and all law enforcement agencies at national and international levels. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 makes provision for the Bureau to seize assets that were generated in foreign jurisdictions. This Act enables the Bureau to cooperate fully with other international asset recovery agencies.</p><p>I am advised by the Bureau that figures for 2021 are not yet available pending publication of the CAB Annual Report for 2021. Similarly, figures to date in 2022 are currently unavailable. For the Deputy's information, the CAB Annual Reports are available to view at the following link:</p><p>www.cab.ie/annual-reports/</p><p>The table below, provided by CAB from their published Annual Reports, indicates the total value of assets and cash seized by the Bureau for the years 2016-2020. CAB have confirmed that seizures are not recorded geographically and therefore a breakdown by county is not available. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Section 2 Interim OrdersEURO</th>       <th>Section 2 Interim OrdersSTERLING</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>643,063.07</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>7,020,539.20</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>8,263,582.30</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>64,985,550.30</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>2020</td>        <td>5,814,206.00</td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The large increase in 2019 is due to the granting of a freezing order over cryptocurrency to the value of &euro;53,023,140.</p><p>The table below sets out the total monies returned to the Exchequer under Section 4(1) &amp;amp; 4A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996.

All suspected adverse reaction reports received by the HPRA are entered into the national database for national monitoring and subsequently submitted to the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s (EMA's) adverse reaction database for inclusion in global signal detection and monitoring activities.</p>  <p>  All reports of a suspected adverse reaction (side effect) to a COVID-19 vaccine should be referred to the HPRA. This can be done using the COVID-19 Vaccine adverse reaction reporting form at: www.hpra.ie/homepage/about-us/report-an-issue/covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reaction.</p>  <p>  Adverse reactions can be reported to the HPRA by members of the public, carers or healthcare professionals. Reporting adverse reactions to the HPRA supports continuous monitoring of the safe and effective use of COVID-19 vaccines. When reporting, as much information as is known should be provided, and where possible, the vaccine batch number should be included.</p>  <p>  The HPRA cannot provide clinical advice on individual cases. Members of the public should contact their health care professional (their doctor or pharmacist) with any medical concerns they may have.</p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes regular safety updates which provide an overview of the national reporting experience for COVID-19 vaccines. These updates include an overview of reports of suspected side effects notified to the HPRA safety monitoring system and are provided as an enhanced transparency measure for members of the public and healthcare professionals.</p>  <p>  The most recent vaccine safety updates &amp;amp; communication (update 15) from the HPRA can be found at the following link, along with previous safety updates: safety-update-covid-19-vaccines-overview-of-national-reporting-experience-(20012022).pdf (hpra.ie).</p>  <p>  As the administration of Covid 19 Vaccines is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond on this element to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p><p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7. My officials and the HSE are already engaged in preparatory work, and I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the IMO, representing GPs, later this quarter. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

As an analgesic, codeine is most often used in combination with other analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen and is currently authorised in Ireland in such non-prescription products for pain relief. It is also available in single ingredient, non-prescription products, as a cough suppressant. These authorised products are available without a prescription through retail pharmacy businesses (pharmacies) only. There are currently no plans to update the regulations regarding the sale and supply of these products. </p>  <p>  The Pharmacy Act 2007 and the Regulation of Retail Pharmacy Businesses Regulations 2008 require that all medicines supplied through a pharmacy must be supplied by or under the personal supervision of a pharmacist and that all non-prescription medicines supplied must be the subject of appropriate counselling.</p>  <p>  The pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), issued guidance to pharmacists in 2010 on the safe supply of non-prescription products containing codeine. This guidance was updated in 2015, 2017 and most recently in October 2019. The Guidance covers the requirements set out above and, in addition, contains further restrictions which apply to the supply of codeine-based products. </p>  <p>  The full guidance document, along with information on current legislative requirements, is available on the PSI website:</p>  <p> thepsi.ie/Libraries/Folder_Pharmacy_Practice_Guidance/01_3_Safe_supply_of_Codeine_to_patients.sflb.ashx.</p></reply>

All other activities which do not relate to Aquaculture or Fisheries activities are the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The management of aquaculture and associated foreshore licensing function in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough gives rise to legal and jurisdictional complexities. Applications for Aquaculture licenses are considered by my Department under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (amendment) Act, the 1933 Foreshore Act, and applicable EU Legislation. However, in the case of Lough Foyle, Section 2 of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act disapplies the Act to the Moville Area, as it is defined in the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952. </p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission (FCILC). This body is one of the six North South Implementation Bodies created under the Agreement. The Loughs Agency, as part of the FCLIC, has been given responsibility for fisheries related matters in respect of both Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough and the legislation envisages that the Agency will enter into management agreement with the relevant authorities in both jurisdictions with a view to assuming responsibly for aquaculture licensing within the loughs. </p>  <p>  Discussions in respect of the management agreement are ongoing. Negotiations regarding the jurisdiction of the Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough along with any other jurisdictional issues are in the first instance, a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs. In view of the multi-dimensional and cross jurisdictional nature of the issue involved it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.</p></reply>

The maximum budget for the scheme is &euro;3.7 million.</p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for the scheme are based on the detailed scheme proposal to the Task Force made by the National Inshore Fisheries Forum and recommended by the Task Force for implementation. The NIFF criteria include an exclusion for owners of vessels which have received a payment under the Brexit Temporary  Fleet Tie-up Scheme, with the objective being to avoid aiding individuals twice for the impacts of Brexit.</p></reply>
