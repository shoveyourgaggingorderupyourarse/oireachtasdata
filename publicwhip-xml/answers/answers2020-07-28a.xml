Her report made a number of recommendations designed to regulate their use and enhance accountability. </p>  <p>  The EU, in the interactive debate on the report, stated that accountability for human rights violations and abuses and violations of international humanitarian law must always be ensured, whoever the perpetrator is and called on all States to ensure accountability, where necessary through cooperation with or support of investigative bodies and mechanisms. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the important work of the UN Special Rapporteur and co-sponsored the Resolution adopted during the 44th Session of the Human Rights Council, which concluded last week, extending her mandate for a further three years.</p></reply>

To achieve this, Northern Ireland will remain in the UK customs territory, but will continue to apply the rules of the Union Customs Code and certain other relevant EU legislation. </p>  <p>  Article 12 of the Protocol provides for EU representatives to be present for activities relating to the application and implementation of the Protocol. In this context, the question of an EU office in Belfast has been discussed at the Joint and Specialised Committees. </p>  <p>  There are ongoing discussions between the EU and the UK on how this commitment under the Protocol can be made operational.  We hope, and are confident, that agreement can be reached through the Specialised and Joint Committees on how the EU presence envisaged in the Protocol can operate in an appropriate way.</p></reply>

A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, provides a vision for Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation, including the clear commitment of the Government to direct ODA to reaching the furthest behind first. </p>  <p>  Successive OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) peer reviews have commended Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation for its poverty focus and commitment to Least Developed Countries. The OECD DAC&rsquo;s most recent review, published in May 2020, notes that Ireland 'walks the talk' in allocating ODA to least developed countries and fragile states, priority partners and sectors.  The OECD finds that this clear focus enables Ireland to exercise leadership and make a visible difference. The ODI, a leading development think-tank, has also ranked Ireland as the most effective international donor in directing resources to those in extreme poverty. </p>  <p>  Ireland works with a variety of partners in order to reach those in greatest need around the world. Our multilateral partnerships, including our work through the EU and United Nations give Ireland a significant global presence and footprint, including in fragile states and conflict-affected contexts. This enables Ireland to direct vital assistance to people living in challenging and insecure environments.  </p>  <p>  Our bilateral partnerships, which includes partnerships with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), focus on our thematic and geographic priorities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  Ireland is one of the leading OECD DAC donors in providing support to and through CSOs, with the OECD peer review finding that these relationships are characterised by mutual trust, quality funding, and an open culture for substantive and regular dialogue. </p>  <p>  Both bilateral and multilateral aid modalities play an important and complementary role in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is directed to where it is needed most and has the maximum impact.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-28a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072800102#WRB01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 49 and 60 together.</p>  <p>  No deal preparations were well advanced for the possibility of a no deal Brexit on 29 March, 31 October, 2019 and 31 January 2020. The additional time afforded by the transition period has allowed Departments to refine this work and re-calibrate it as necessary for the end of the transition period. The end of transition will involve both immediate challenges and long term, permanent changes.</p>  <p>  In any scenario from 1 January 2021, the UK will be outside the EU Single Market and Customs Union.  This will bring significant changes to Ireland&rsquo;s supply chains and trade flows &ndash; creating new checks on trade in both directions and increasing costs and administrative burdens on business. </p>  <p>  Given the limited progress in EU-UK Future Partnership negotiations, on 29 May the Government approved the intensification of readiness and contingency planning across all Departments on the basis of two scenarios: (i) a limited FTA and accompanying fisheries agreement, or, (ii) a hard Brexit (no trade agreement).  While Ireland still supports the closest possible relationship between the EU and UK, prudence dictates that we approach our contingency planning on this basis.</p>  <p>  In response to requests from nine Departments, the Government on 29 May 2020 approved the preparation of a scheme for a new Brexit Omnibus Bill.  I expect to bring this scheme to Government for approval and publication in the coming weeks with a view to bringing it to the Oireachtas in the autumn.</p>  <p>  A key difference between the 2019 Act and 2020 Brexit Bill is that the 2019 Act sought to provide contingency measures to address issues arising in a no deal cliff-edge scenario while the 2020 version will deal with permanent change that will take place at the end of the transition period. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Bill is to provide a legislative underpinning to the wide ranging and complex issues that arise post transition. It will seek to protect citizens and consumers, facilitate the sound functioning of key sectors and ensure our businesses are not disadvantaged.  It will also support aspects of the Common Travel Area and North/South cooperation.</p>  <p>  In parallel with this legislation, the Government continues to intensify all its readiness preparations. We have made substantial investments in infrastructure and systems at our ports and airports to prepare for the introduction of checks on controls on EU-UK trade. </p>  <p>  In partnership with other Landbridge countries and the Commission, we recently addressed a number of SPS related challenges that had arisen.  While the Landbridge will remain a route to market, it is important to note that the way the Landbridge is used will change at the end of the transition period.  We will work with traders and hauliers to inform them of the steps they need to take.</p>  <p>  In 2019, over 63,000 businesses registered for an EORI number, covering 95.8 % of the volume of exports to the UK in 2019 and 92.7% of imports.  Two weeks ago, the Revenue Commissioners wrote to over 60,000 businesses that traded with the UK since 2019 which had not yet registered for EORI. Government outreach also promotes awareness of the need for business to address a range of new administrative, customs, regulatory and SPS issues arising from the UK becoming a third country.</p>  <p>  The Government established a &euro;20 million Brexit fund to help SMEs involved in exporting and importing with the UK and further afield to put in place the staff, software and IT systems to be ready for new customs arrangements from 1 January 2021. Further supports are available to businesses as part of the recovery agenda announced in the July Stimulus to help businesses reopen, create jobs and prepare for the economy of the future.</p>  <p>  The &euro;5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve which forms part of the new MFF is very welcome and will help cushion the impact on those Member States and sectors most affected. The special allocation of &euro;120 million for a new PEACE PLUS programme is also welcome. This will continue the work of the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes in a post-Brexit context</p>  <p>  We will continue to work closely with the European Commission on readiness work at a European level.  The Commission is currently updating 102 &lsquo;Readiness Notices&rsquo;, which provide advice for businesses and citizens on a wide range of issues affected by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU acquis. These include, inter alia, Air Transport, Food Law and VAT. Where applicable, the updated notices provide guidance to businesses and citizens on the operation of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland. The question of contingency measures at EU level for a hard Brexit will also be discussed at the appropriate time.</p>  <p>  I will publish an update of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness and Contingency Action Plan in September.  This will outline the work taking place across Government and the steps business and citizens should take to prepare for the end of the transition period.   We will also roll out a new focused communications programmes for the final phase.</p>  <p>  Whatever the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations, it will not be the status quo and the way we trade with the UK will change.  With less than six months to the end to the transition period, Government will continue to develop and refine our readiness efforts.  It is vital that business and citizens do the same.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the outcome of the future negotiations partnerships, the Withdrawal Agreement including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland will remain in place.  We will also face into this new phase of our relationship with the UK as a Member of the EU27 and the strength and solidarity that brings.</p></reply>

The travel advice for those locations now is to 'take normal precautions,' which is represented by a green bar under the system of country security ratings used by the Department of Foreign Affairs. </p>  <p>  The fifteen locations whose security status was changed to 'normal precautions'/ ("green") are: Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Gibraltar, Greece, Greenland, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Monaco, San Marino and Slovakia.</p>  <p>  The criteria for inclusion on the list are based on the current epidemiological situation and related public health information in each location. As I said earlier,  the European territories in question had, over the previous 14 days, a similar or lower caseload of COVID-19 per 100,000 people than Ireland as reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. </p>  <p>  The list and related travel advice will be reviewed on a fortnightly basis, based on advice from officials including public health experts. Any updates or changes to travel advice will be made in line with Government decisions.</p>  <p>  We are in the midst of a global pandemic, with more than 16 million people infected.

These flights, which were arranged in close cooperation with EU partners and facilitated travel of citizens from other EU Member States, were supported through the EU &ldquo;Union Civil Protection Mechanism&rdquo; - the first time Ireland has arranged flights using this method. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that, to date, my Department has advised or assisted over 8,000 people to return safely to Ireland as part of this consular response.</p>  <p>  There are strong indications from our Missions abroad that, to a very large extent, the vast majority of citizens who wished to travel home in the context of the crisis have, with a number of exceptions, already returned, many with the assistance of Embassies. </p>  <p>  The global situation continues to evolve quickly and there are therefore challenges in quantifying those who may still wish to return home. For example, while many Governments are now easing travel restrictions, others are maintaining or indeed re-imposing restrictions on travel. Furthermore there continues to be great unpredictability in relation to flight routes across the world - some flight routes are opening up again while restrictions and route cancellations are also happening on a daily basis worldwide. Our Embassies report that many callers are making contact in hope of verifying the existence of commercial options. Local economic and employment prospects also remain uncertain and this is of course an important factor for many of our citizens abroad. </p>  <p>  In that context our Embassies are maintaining regular contact with our citizens in need of assistance abroad and there remain over 800 Irish citizens globally who have expressed an interest in my Department&rsquo;s assistance with returning to Ireland. However numbers may fluctuate in what is still an evolving situation.</p></reply>

Timely and effective communication will be an important part of this. These points also been made clear by Northern Irish business representatives and other stakeholders, North and South, in my own engagements with them. </p>  <p>  It is of crucial importance that the UK advance detailed implementation of all aspects of the Protocol without delay. We have made this point consistently clear in our engagements with the UK Government, for example in my meeting with Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove on 15 July. It was also made clear at the most recent meeting of the EU-UK Specialised Committee on 16 July, which Ireland attended as part of the EU delegation. </p>  <p>  The Government acknowledges and welcomes recent positive developments in this regard, including the UK&rsquo;s application for SPS-related border control posts in Northern Ireland, as well as other recent technical engagements which have taken place between the EU and UK on implementation of the Protocol. However, it is clear that further progress is required and we continue to urge the UK Government to take this operational and technical work forward as a matter of urgency, to give all stakeholders in Northern Ireland the clarity they need. </p>  <p>  The Protocol allows for a set of arrangements to address the challenges of Brexit on the island of Ireland. The Protocol is designed to protect the peace and prosperity delivered through the Good Friday Agreement in all circumstances, while also protecting the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. We remain firmly of the view that the Protocol, once fully implemented, will work well for Northern Ireland and for Ireland.</p></reply>

A further round is scheduled for 17 August. Intensified talks have also been taking place between the Chief Negotiators, and their teams, in between the formal negotiation rounds. We hope that this intensified schedule of talks can help to bridge the gaps on the key issues, such as fisheries, the Level Playing Field, law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and governance.</p><p>Addressing these issues is key to progress, as set out in the Political Declaration, which was agreed between the EU and the UK in October 2019. We believe this remains the best way forward.</p><p>Progress in the negotiations so far has been disappointing.  Michel Barnier and David Frost, following last week&rsquo;s round of negotiations, have pointed to some progress in areas such as social security cooperation, and justice and home affairs. However, significant divergences remain in key areas, such as level-playing field issues and fisheries, where Mr Barnier has stated there was no progress in the latest round.</p><p>The EU will continue working with patience, respect and determination, to seek to reach an agreement ahead of the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.</p><p>In the period ahead, Ireland will continue to work as part of the EU27 to ensure that our collective approach to these negotiations reflects our values and interests.</p><p>Ireland seeks the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK, but no set of arrangements will be able to replicate the access and benefits of the UK being a member of the EU. All scenarios will bring substantial challenges for supply chains and trade flows, and it is important that we are prepared for this.</p><p>The Government will continue to advance its extensive work to ensure that Irish citizens and businesses are prepared.

They are illegal under international law, notably being contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention, and actively undermine the prospects for a two-state solution. Ireland has consistently and strongly opposed settlements, and this Government will continue to do so. </p>  <p>  As I have said many times, the regulation of international trade, including in relation to settlement goods, is a matter of exclusive EU competence. To introduce a ban on the importation of settlement goods would ask the Government to do something which is not legally in its power. </p>  <p>  The European Commission confirmed to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence in June of last year that "...the EU has exclusive competence on the common commercial policy, and that as a customs union, the EU applies common arrangements for imports of goods from third countries uniformly across the Union. In principle, only the EU can decide to prohibit the importation of goods and services and not the Member States individually."</p>  <p>  Should Ireland move to introduce a ban on settlement goods, and be found to have breached EU law, as we would expect, the State would then be exposed to potential fines, as well as legal costs. There has been regular and ongoing engagement between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the issue of banning settlement goods, including the matter of potential fines. It is self-evident that breaches of EU law can lead to infringement proceedings, which in turn can potentially result in fines being imposed by the EU Court of Justice.</p></reply>

Our bilateral trade with Britain, worth over 1 billion Euro per week, as well as our significant people-to-people links, ensure that close co-operation remains firmly in the interest of our respective citizens after the Transition Period ends at the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed the importance of that mutual co-operation in his recent call with Prime Minister Johnson. I have similarly set out our intention and ambition to work with the UK across all areas of mutual interest to my counterpart, Foreign Secretary Raab, in recent weeks.  Many other Ministers have had positive contacts with their counterparts in London, and those in the devolved administrations, since the Government took office.  I believe that these positive early contacts demonstrate a shared commitment to work together in a pragmatic spirit over the coming years. </p>  <p>  Ireland regrets the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, although we respect it; and though we will no longer meet in Brussels, we have committed in the Programme for Government to finding new ways to engage with our UK counterparts at political as well as official levels. </p>  <p>  This may include developing structures for regular meetings at Heads of Government, Ministerial, as well as senior official levels. An important part of these efforts will be enhancing the role of the valuable institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement that already facilitate structured east-west co-operation: the British-Irish Council and British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. </p>  <p>  Working through these institutions, as well as regular bilateral engagements between the Irish and British Governments across all sectors, will help to ensure that our interests are protected and advanced. The continued effective operation of the Common Travel Area, and the safeguarding of reciprocal rights in social protection, education, and healthcare, is vital of course in underpinning this close and distinct relationship. </p>  <p>  East-west relations are of course broader than those between Dublin and London alone. My Government colleagues and I will also seek to strengthen our relationships with the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales over the next five years. Promising work is already ongoing in this area, led by Ireland's Consulates General in Edinburgh and Cardiff, and with regular contact at Ministerial level. </p>  <p>  I recognise additionally, that there is a need to increase our engagement at a regional level.  To that end, the Government has committed to opening a new Consulate in the north of England. It is envisaged that the new Consulate will cover the entire north of England, including major population centres such as Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. This would broadly match the area known as the 'Northern Powerhouse,' an area with a population of about 15 million people and close historical and current links with Ireland and our diaspora. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to carry out a comprehensive review of British-Irish relations in 2020/21. As the future shape of the relationship between the UK and the EU is being settled in the coming months, I believe it is timely and appropriate to thoroughly evaluate how Ireland can work most effectively with our nearest neighbour into the future. This strategic review will seek to establish how we can best adapt to this new context in which the UK is outside of the EU while we remain at its heart, and will set a high level of ambition for every aspect of the bilateral relationship for the coming years.</p></reply>

Where this was not possible due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I have remained in regular contact with the First Minister, Deputy First Minister, other members of the Executive, and political leaders.</p>  <p>  Most recently,  I travelled to Belfast last Tuesday where I met with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, as well as leaders of the political parties. We had constructive discussions on a range of issues including the all-island response to Covid-19, implementation of the New Decade, New Approach Agreement and issues relating to Brexit. I also met with representatives from the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group.</p>  <p>  I travelled to Armagh on 14 March for a meeting between Government Ministers and members of the NI Executive on public health challenges posed by Covid-19, North and South.</p>  <p>  In February, I met with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis in Belfast, shortly after his appointment. I have been in regular contact with Secretary of State Lewis in the intervening period, both bilaterally and in coordination calls on the response to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  I attended the funeral of Seamus Mallon in late January to pay my respects to one of the architects of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s peace process.</p>  <p>  I also spent a number of days in Northern Ireland in early January as part of efforts to restore the power sharing institutions. As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government, working with the British Government, spared no effort in supporting and facilitating the talks, which culminated in the New Decade New Approach agreement. On 9 January, then Secretary of State Julian Smith and I published the text of an agreement to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland. This agreement was accepted by the five main political parties and I returned to Northern Ireland alongside the then Taoiseach on 13 January to meet with the British Prime Minister, Secretary of State and First and Deputy First Ministers to reaffirm our commitments to the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

The spread of COVID-19 threatens a catastrophic situation in a country where the health system has been shattered by years of conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply concerned by this level of humanitarian suffering, and has provided over &euro;27 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since 2015, including &euro;5 million in 2020.</p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes substantial funding at the global level, including Ireland's support to the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund, a global fund to address the most severe crises. Ireland is one of the top ten contributors to the CERF, which in 2019 allocated $32 million to Yemen.</p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes to the EU response and since 2015 the EU has allocated &euro;484 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen.</p>  <p>  Decisions on arms exports are a national competence, rather than an EU competence. All EU arms exports are subject to the Common Position on arms export control, which set out eight criteria that must be met before issuing export licenses, including respect for International Humanitarian Law in the receiving country.</p>  <p>  The roots of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen lies in conflict. Ireland and the EU fully support the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, to bring about a political resolution to the conflict. The UN Secretary General&rsquo;s call for a global ceasefire in March, later affirmed by the Security Council in Resolution 2532, gives a renewed impetus to this work.</p>  <p>  I welcome efforts made towards a Joint Declaration between the Government of Yemen and the Houthis which would commit the parties to a nationwide ceasefire, bring forward a number of economic and humanitarian measures, and resume a political process.  However, despite the Special Envoy&rsquo;s efforts, agreement has still not been reached.</p>  <p>  I call on all parties to the conflict to engage seriously with these efforts to end the conflict, and ease the suffering of the people of Yemen. I also call on all parties to ensure full, secure and unimpeded access for humanitarian and health workers and supplies to all parts of Yemen, to allow lifesaving assistance to reach those in greatest need.</p></reply>

Timing and context would affect whether this loss of influence would be matched by delivering a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people and a positive impact on the peace process. I am continuing to monitor the situation closely. </p>  <p>  On the issue of annexation, I have been forthright in my public statements and Ireland has made every effort over the past year to discourage this step. The unilateral annexation by Israel of any part of the occupied Palestinian territory would be a clear violation of international law. It would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland, or by the international community more generally, and would be deeply damaging to the two-state solution. The Programme for Government states that the Government would &ldquo;regard any such moves as a breach of international law and would consider an appropriate response to them at both national and international level.&rdquo;</p></reply>

Over the course of the next five years, this Government will take steps to develop the strategies and the policies required to achieve this. At the heart of all of this will, of course, be creating new jobs, preparing for the jobs of the future, driving our economic recovery, and improving the quality of life for all our people.</p><p>Significant Exchequer support, through wage subsidies, the PUP, grants for businesses, low cost loans and commercial rates waivers. The July Stimulus is the next step in our recovery. We have listened to businesses and responded with a package of scale and speed to meet their most immediate needs. The July Stimulus is designed to stimulate a jobs-led recovery and build economic confidence while continuing to manage the impact of Covid-19. It backs businesses and workers so that together we can return to prosperity and growth.</p><p>The full list of actions within the July Stimulus and how to avail of them can be found at <i>www.gov.ie/jobsstimulus</i>.</p><p>Government analysis, that is available online, showed that the most-heavily impacted sectors are accommodation and food, construction, administrative and support services, wholesale and retail trade, and other personal services. Evidence for this includes the numbers of employees in these sectors availing of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and Pandemic Unemployment Payment. A number of these sectors have pay levels below average and employ a high share of women and young people. </p><p>Moreover, Ireland is not alone in this. Recent international research from Eurofound, the OECD and the IMF have come to similar conclusions highlighting that women have been more adversely affected than man by the crisis and that the risk of young workers (up to age 35) being the victim of new economic fallout is very high.  </p><p>I expect the measures in the July Stimulus package will particularly help these sectors thus offsetting the impacts on inequality resulting from the crisis.</p><p>The July Stimulus will be followed in October by the National Economic Plan, our longer-term economic roadmap, to be published alongside the next Budget.</p><p>Careful consideration will need to be given to gender and equality during the recovery as I know different people have been impacted in different ways by the crisis.

F&aacute;ilte Ireland has consulted the industry to develop this set of detailed and practical guidelines to prepare pubs to re-open safely. All of the principles in these guidelines are underpinned by advice made available from the HSA, HSE, FSAI, WHO?and other?relevant bodies.  </p><p>The F&aacute;ilte Ireland operational guidelines for reopening of pubs are available on its website at: <i></i>. These guidelines will be regularly updated in line with Government public health advice as and when this advice evolves.?</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and employees the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at <i></i>. It operates in parallel with existing workplace health and safety statutory requirements and will assist employers to carry out a full risk assessment in relation to their business operations.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace. If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or <i>wcu@hsa.ie</i>. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority has also developed a range of checklists and templates which are available on its website (<i>www.hsa.ie</i>) for use by employers, workers and worker representatives, and further material is being developed.</p><p>While the lead engagement with the pub sector is through F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Minister for Tourism, my predecessor as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys, T.D. met with the representative bodies for the sector, as has the Secretary General of my Department, and the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Damien English, T.D., who met representatives of the sector on 16 July last. </p><p>On Thursday 23 July last we announced the July Stimulus Package, a substantial financial package to stimulate our economy worth more than &euro;5 billion, with an additional &euro;2 billion in loan guarantees. It is bigger in scale than most budgets and will be deployed at speed.</p><p>The July Stimulus package is designed to help businesses to open, to help those that are already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, there are new opportunities. These new measures are in addition to those already announced since the onset of the Global Pandemic that were open to those in the hospitality and pub sectors including the Temporary Wage Subsidy, low cost loans and commercial rates waivers. </p><p>Significantly for the hospitality and pub sector to support viable businesses and jobs, including new hires, we have extended the wage subsidy scheme, which will run until the end of March 2021 and will be open to firms that do not currently participate and will be open to workers like seasonal workers, who were not previously included. We are also giving companies extra assistance to reopen and stay open through an enhanced Restart grant which is available to more firms and is more generous. We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. We have also announced a six month reduction in VAT from 23% to 21%, together with a range of additional measures designed to stimulate domestic demand.  Businesses affected by COVID-19 will able to delay payment of their PAYE and VAT debts in part of in full for a set period with no interest or penalties</p><p>Furthermore, to assist the badly impacted hospitality and tourism sectors, a new Stay and Spend Incentive will see any taxpayer spending over &euro;625, on accommodation, food and non-alcoholic drinks, between October 2020 and April 2021, able to claim back &euro;125 through a tax credit.  It is anticipated that whilst these hospitality supports are not directly targeted at the on-trade drinks sector, a boost to the hospitality sector in general will have spill over benefits for pubs.</p><p>Further information on these, along with the full list of actions within the July Stimulus and how to avail of them can be found at <i>www.gov.ie/jobsstimulus</i>.</p><p>I have underlined that in developing the stimulus package, we must look ahead to ensuring economic recovery. The National Economic Plan, to be developed in parallel with the next Budget, will be crucial in this respect. It will go beyond the issue of business supports and set out a range of actions to be developed across Government to realise economic recovery.</p></reply>

The NBP State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under a contract signed on 19 November last. The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150Mbps from the outset. By the end of next year, NBI plans to pass in the region of 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 17 counties and steady progress is being made with circa 55,000 premises surveyed to date. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and laying fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year.</p><p>  The Covid 19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. Recognising this, the Programme for Government commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. The Programme for Government also recognises that the NBP will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working and remote service delivery.</p><p>My Department is currently engaging with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout and bring forward premises which are scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. These discussions are ongoing and a preliminary position will be arrived at by the end of the summer.</p><p>  To support remote working and rural connectivity, locations for up to 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs) have been identified by Local Authorities. The BCP delivery project is well underway and connectivity is being provided to each of the sites by National Broadband Ireland (NBI). Subsequent to this, the sites, other than schools, are being Wi-Fi enabled by Vodafone under a contract with the Department of Rural and Community Development. This work also involves the local authorities and site owners determining the services that will be provided for end-users at each site. For the 75 schools that are also part of this project, enabling these schools with Wi-Fi is being led by the Department of Education following NBI providing the connectivity to the schools.</p></reply>

The programme for Government commits to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland. It includes a range of measures across cycling and walking, greenways, transport infrastructure, public transport, rail, buses, taxi road transport and safety. This is recognition that new strategies will be needed to sustain a reduction trajectory that will increase over time to meet an economy-wide average 7% per annum fall in emissions to 2030. The strategies to deliver these emissions reductions will require genuine consultation, detailed planning, organisation and adequate mechanisms for funding and incentives, as well as the gradual build-up of their impact.   The transition to alternatively-fuelled vehicles and away from fossil-fuelled vehicles is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the passenger car fleet which accounts for 52% of transport emissions, or approximately 10% of Ireland&rsquo;s total annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan sets out a pathway for the uptake of electric vehicles over the next decade based on analysis to identify key emissions abatement technologies.  It is widely expected that, over the next number of years, the combination of improvements in technology, reductions in vehicle purchase prices, increasing driving ranges and model availabilities, coupled with Government incentives and new investment in the recharging network will maintain the current positive policy environment under which electric vehicle sales have risen steeply in recent years, albeit from a low base.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan therefore sets targets for electric and low emissions vehicles by 2030 as follows:</p>  <p>  - Increasing the number of passenger EVs on the road to 840,000 (split between 550,000 BEVs and 290,000 PHEVs)</p>  <p>  - Reaching 95,000 electric vans and trucks </p>  <p>  - Procuring 1,200 low-emissions buses for public transport in cities</p>  <p>  The Plan expects the bulk of the shift to EVs (and the resulting emissions reduction) to occur in the second half of the next decade, when prices have fallen in line with technology development, and purchasing behaviour patterns have changed. These targets are challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation required if Ireland is to reach its legally binding emission ceilings in future years.</p>  <p>  Achieving the Climate Action Plan targets will likely require a suite of policy and regulatory interventions at national and EU level.  Action 79 of the Climate Action Plan committed to the development of a roadmap on the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies to drive significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales from very early in the next decade.  The Electric Vehicle Optimum Policy Pathway Group, established to take forward this work, is due to present its final report to me shortly. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, the Government is also fully committed to introducing a ban on the sale of fossil-fuelled internal combustion engine cars and to the targets set out in the Climate Action Plan for electric and low emissions vehicles by 2030. The General Scheme of the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill, published in December 2019, proposes to include a provision to ban the sale of fossil fuel cars by 2030 and to stop the granting of NCTs by 2045 to address the commitments in the Climate Action Plan. Work on the drafting of this legislation is ongoing in my Department.</p>  <p>  Since 2009, EU legislation sets mandatory emission reduction targets for all new passenger cars and vans registered in the EU. The legislation is the cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s strategy to improve vehicle fuel economy and has driven car manufacturers to develop innovative energy efficient technologies. The regulations have iteratively been made more stringent, progressively decreasing EU fleet-wide average emissions along with increasing the availability of lower emission vehicles across the EU. </p>  <p>  Regulation (EU) 2019/631 sets CO2 emission performance standards to ensure that, by 2025 and 2030, the average emissions from new cars will be 15% and 37.5% lower, respectively, compared to 2021 levels.  The Regulation is also structured to incentivise manufacturers to increase the production of zero- and low-emission vehicles. </p>  <p>  Achievement of these targets by manufactures will make an important contribution to both the EU and individual Member State emissions reductions targets for 2030. Due to the absence of vehicle manufacturing here, Ireland will remain strongly dependent on continued action at an EU level in this respect.  Notwithstanding this, Member States may introduce additional domestic policies and measures and impose more ambitious targets for specific sectors. The Climate Action Plan imposes specific and differentiated targets for individual sectors, based on an analysis of the most cost-effective split of emissions reductions across the economy in order to meet Ireland's emissions reduction targets for the 2021 - 2030 period. The Plan targets a 45% - 50% reduction in transport sector emissions by 2030 relative to existing projections.</p>  <p>  The new European Green Deal proposes that, by June 2021, the Commission will revise the legislation on CO2 emission performance standards for cars and vans, to ensure a clear pathway from 2025 onwards towards zero-emission mobility.</p></reply>

The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  In order to hit our overall target, we will need to scale up activity to at least 56,000 B2 retrofits per year by 2025.  Retrofitting has the ability to contribute to a number of important goals including - decarbonisation; warmer, more comfortable homes; and job creation and retention. </p>  <p>  A cross-Departmental Retrofit Taskforce has been established to develop a new retrofit delivery model capable of achieving these targets and an estimate of the total cost. This process has been informed by experience from existing schemes in Ireland, consultation with stakeholders and an analysis of relevant international experience. The model is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: customer proposition and demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity, and delivery structure.  The Retrofit Taskforce report is to be published in October 2020.</p>  <p>  The cost of bringing a home to a B2 or cost optimal standard is determined by a number of factors including the size and type of home as well as the starting condition of the home. However a cost-optimal analysis commissioned by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government estimated the cost to achieve a B2 rating from a starting point of a D or E rating to be in the range of &euro;21,000-&euro;39,000. 90% of our dwellings are estimated to have Building Energy Ratings below a B2.   The Retrofit Taskforce is working to finalise an estimate of the total cost of the retrofit programme as well as a new average cost. </p>  <p>  Achievement of these targets will be supported by the Programme for Government commitment to ring-fencing a significant portion of future carbon tax receipts for a new &euro;5 billion socially progressive retrofit fund.  As part of the July Stimulus, I have taken the decision to increase the SEAI budget by &euro;100 million in 2021.  This money will be focused on community retrofit schemes, retrofit schemes supporting those in energy poverty as well as other initiatives to support the achievement of our retrofit targets. The SEAI will be announcing the first details of the new and expanded retrofit schemes next month.</p></reply>

It will also help us to move towards 70% renewable electricity. A resilient and well connected energy infra structure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.     </p>  <p>  EirGrid is the designated Transmission System Operator and its role includes the operation, maintenance and development of the electricity transmission network in Ireland. The construction of the North South Interconnector, and all related procurement activities, is an operational matter for EirGrid and ESB Networks and one in which I have no function. I am advised that due to the very long lead times that can arise in relation to projects of this nature and the benefits of a single joint procurement process to be undertaken and managed by ESB Networks, EirGrid sought approval from the regulators in Ireland and Northern Ireland to commence procurement. Following this approval, in September 2017, ESB Networks commenced a number of procurement processes in relation to the project. In June 2019, ESB Networks awarded a framework contract for the design, test and supply of steelwork in relation to the project. However, under this framework there will be no supply of materials and no critical procurement process for construction will be concluded until the planning process in Northern Ireland is complete.</p></reply>

However, where the annual commercial quota has been reached, or the number of tags in the commercial fisherman&rsquo;s possession are exhausted, the regulations require cessation of fishing activity and any surplus salmon to be released alive.  Any accidental mortalities in excess of the available quota or tag allocation must be surrendered to IFI.</p>  <p>  It is extremely difficult to accurately determine the sex of salmon and sea trout by external visual inspection and for many freshly caught fish internal examination for accurate sex determination would be necessary.  Even internal examination to determine sex requires very specific expertise. </p>  <p>  The independent Technical Expert Group on Salmon has already carried out a scientific analysis of the gender distribution in the Irish salmon stock and compiled a National index of the proportion of males and females. This analysis indicates that 60% of one sea winter fish and 85% of multi sea winter fish are classed as female. These proportions are used by scientists to estimate the number of eggs laid in the calculation of salmon conservation limits.</p></reply>

The NBP State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under a contract signed on 19 November last.The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150Mbps from the outset. By the end of next year, NBI plans to pass in the region of 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 17 counties and steady progress is being made with circa 55,000 premises surveyed to date.

I propose to take Questions Nos 105,106,107 and 108 together.</p>  <p>  5G Mobile Networks are in their early stages of rollout globally, and will offer both improved services to customers and likely give rise to a variety of new use cases for telecommunications services. Importantly, the software based nature of 5G systems gives rise to new types of security risks  in addition to those arising from traditional networks.  </p>  <p>  In early 2019 the EU embarked on a detailed assessment of the security risks associated with 5G. This involved each Member State conducting their own risk assessment, and the subsequent publication of a joint EU wide assessment. This was followed in January 2020 by the publication of a &lsquo;Toolbox&rsquo; of risk mitigation measures, and on 24 July by an update on the implementation of the toolbox.</p>  <p>  Government is committed to further enhancing the security of our telecommunications infrastructure, including 5G networks. The recently adopted National Cybersecurity Strategy sets out a range of measures that Government will take over the coming years in this regard, building on a comprehensive EU-led risk assessment process. The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of my Department, conducted the National Risk Assessment in early 2019, and is now working with industry on the development of a set of enhanced Telecoms Security Requirements (TSRs) to secure all telecommunications services in the State. These TSRs will encompass the full range of issues covered by the Toolbox, and will be published for public consultation later this year.</p></reply>

It will also help us to move towards 70% renewable electricity, a commitment made in the Programme for Government Our Shared Future. A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there are concerns in relation to the construction of the interconnector as an overhead line and a variety of interests wish to meet with me as the new Minister with responsibility.  However, the option of undergrounding the line has been assessed on several occasions over the years. Most recently, my Department published an independent study in October 2018 on undergrounding the interconnector which found that an overhead line remained the most appropriate option for the proposed interconnector. The study report is available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  This study was the latest in a series of studies that reached the same conclusion and further meetings are unnecessary as I do not intend to order a further review of the project.</p></reply>

It does, however, provide support for the installation of charging infrastructure through the SEAI and the Climate Action Fund (CAF) to facilitate the development of Ireland&rsquo;s charging network. My Department has committed &euro;10m from the CAF to enable ESB ecars in expanding the national charging network which involves the installation of various types of charging infrastructure across the country including new high power chargers (150kW), fast chargers (50kW) and standard chargers (22kW). The SEAI provides support across two main categories, namely home and public charging points.Home charging accounts for around 80% of EV charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit. It would cost up to &euro;471,000 to provide 785 home charger grants.</p><p>In addition, SEAI also administers an EV Public Charge Point Grant to local authorities to install charge points for EV owners who rely on public streets and car parks to park near their homes. A total of 75% of the capital costs is provided through the grant, up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 per charge point. Accordingly, it would cost up to &euro;3.925 million to fund 785 of these charge points.</p><p>The new Programme for Government commits to publishing an EV strategy to ensure charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand and this work is currently underway so as to ensure we can build on our success to date and provide for an appropriate level of charging infrastructure across the country for the years ahead.</p></reply>

This role includes assessment and approval of projects.  The SSRH features a broad range of necessary qualification criteria and financial safeguards. These have been put in place to ensure that the outcomes associated with similar schemes in other jurisdictions are not repeated in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Under the European Commission's State aid approval for the scheme, only new projects can be supported.</p>  <p>  The SSRH has been fully operational since June 2019. This is a relatively short time and, therefore, there is limited data available to fully assess the effectiveness of the scheme and to provide a basis for significant changes.  My Department, together with the SEAI, will continue to monitor and develop the scheme, to ensure effectiveness across both the operational support and also the installation grant for heat pumps where uptake has been slow so far.</p></reply>

In relation to climate change, Ireland's engagement with its EU and international partners takes place through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. Ireland is committed to promoting sustainable environmental practices and increased climate ambition through these processes, and engages in negotiations through its membership of the European Union. Together with its EU partners, Ireland looks forward to continued positive engagement and ambitious climate action by all Parties to the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement.     </p>  <p>  The Bonn Challenge is a global effort to bring 150 million hectares of the world&rsquo;s deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2020, and 350 million hectares by 2030. The Programme for Government commits to the development a new strategy to expand afforestation, particularly close to nature forestry and agro-forestry, which will be led by the Minister of Agriculture Food and Marine. Forestry provides verifiable removal and storage of CO2 from the atmosphere, which will help Ireland to meet its ambitious climate objectives.

It will also help us to move towards 70% renewable electricity, a commitment made in the Programme for Government Our Shared Future. A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers. The option of undergrounding the line has been assessed on several occasions over the years. Most recently, my Department published an independent study in October 2018 on undergrounding the interconnector which found that an overhead line remained the most appropriate option for the proposed interconnector. The study report is available on the Department's website.  <i>​</i></p><p>This study was the latest in a series of studies that reached the same conclusion and I do not intend to order a further review of the project.  </p></reply>

The National Broadband Plan contract provides for the provision of fibre for almost 537,000 premises, with provision to accommodate any newly constructed premises within the intervention area during the term of the contract. All premises in the Intervention Area (including new builds) connected by NBI will be subject to the standard wholesale connection charge, which is currently &euro;100. This has not been changed nor is there any intention to change it.</p>  <p>  In exceptional circumstances where the cost of connection exceeds &euro;5,000, NBI through the retail provider can request the homeowner to contribute towards the excess cost. Such a scenario is considered unlikely and should it arise technical solutions will be explored to ensure the homeowner does not incur any additional charges.</p>  <p>  The NBP network will offer those premises in the Intervention Area, a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150Mbps from the outset.  By the end of next year, NBI plans to pass in the region of 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p></reply>

This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light. Funding of approximately &euro;121 million has been allocated for home and community energy efficiency schemes and the solar PV scheme in 2020.The overarching aim of these schemes is to improve the energy efficiency of our built environment in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding.

The Scheme was reviewed in December 2019 and the costs of installation were assessed. Some grant changes were made to the scheme arising from that assessment. As of end June 2020 there were 3,086 applications who received grant support to date, costing approximately &euro;7.6m with over 10,700kWp installed. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department and full details of grant rates are available at: <i>www.seai.ie</i>The Programme for Government commits to  prioritising the development of micro-generation, letting people sell excess power back to the grid by June 2021. Development in this area may involve changes to the solar panel grants scheme. The measures set out below will assist in delivering this commitment.</p><p>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a Roadmap for the Clean Energy Package&rsquo;s Electricity and Renewables Directives in March this year, which provides for a public consultation on the regulatory framework for prosumer development later this year.

The proposed support mechanism will be outlined in a public consultation in Q3 2020.</p><p>A suitable support payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will, therefore, be available to all micro-generators in accordance with the timeline set out in the Programme for Government.

It is proposed as a 575km long (500km subsea), 700MW high voltage direct current line from the north-west coast of France to the south coast of Ireland. At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes.   The Celtic Interconnector will provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that will have significant benefits for the people of Ireland. The project will provide access to the European internal electricity market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland.  It will also improve security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via export access to the mainland European markets.</p>  <p>  In late 2019 the European Commission announced a grant of &euro;530m towards the construction of the interconnector under the Connecting Europe Facility fund. This grant was made possible by significant support for the project from the Irish Government that resulted in its designation as an EU Project of Common Interest.</p>  <p>  EirGrid is involved in extensive planning for the development of the interconnector infrastructure and continue to consult widely in that regard. Several public consultations have been held and more focused local engagements are ongoing.</p></reply>

Driving licence exchange agreements are only made when the relevant authorities (the Road Safety Authority in Ireland) in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes, so that each side can be satisfied that they are compatible. Irish driver licensing law operates within a framework of EU law, and the standards for testing drivers are set at EU level.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has previously explored reaching agreement on exchange with the USA.  However, US driver licensing operates at state rather than federal level, meaning that there are 50 licensing systems with widely varying standards. Agreement with any one state would mean taking into account the exchange relations between that state and the other 49. The RSA determined that agreement would not be possible.</p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchange licence, we have no option but to require them to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence.  This is a matter of public safety.  While many may have a safe driving record, we have no way of measuring this.</p>  <p>  At present, people with a full but non-exchange licence go through the normal driver learning process, but can avail of the shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12, and will not have to wait the usual minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test. Taking some lessons is useful in helping people to adjust to Irish driving rules and conditions and in preparing people for the driving test.</p></reply>

However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.  </p>  <p>  Evidently the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  I understand that the main Irish airlines have been offering the option to rebook in circumstances where a flight occurs but people are not able to present because of Government advice.  That said, I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances.   I know it is an issue that my colleague the Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton has identified as needing further engagement with the airlines about, and she intends to do so.</p></reply>

Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year with a total of over &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. In relation to the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline.  The review of these appeals was completed in April 2020 with 6 new allocations approved.  Following the finalisation of the appeals process, a full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP was undertaken. This Review is currently under consideration and includes recommendations for some changes to the terms and conditions of the next round of the SCP. I understand that this is expected to be finalised shortly and a decision on the timing of a new round of the SCP will be taken after that.</p>  <p>  In relation to larger capital projects, the National Sports Policy published in 2018 provided for the establishment of a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount (&euro;300,000) available under the Sports Capital Programme (SCP).  Provisional Grants totalling &euro;82.5m were announced in January of this year. The scheme was open to National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities. While the fund is not open to new applications at present, further calls for applications under the scheme are envisaged in the future.</p></reply>

Such measures included, for a fifth or subsequent permit, an increase in the cost of the permit; a decrease in the duration of a permit; a requirement to take mandatory lessons with an approved driving instructor and a requirement to take a driving test before another permit can be issued. The objective is to make it a disincentive to rely long term on a learner permit. These measures took account of the shorter wait times for tests and the increased tester resources that were available to the RSA at the end of 2019. </p>  <p>  The RSA proposals were examined, but due to the caretaker Government in place earlier this year, it was not possible to make policy changes. Since then, urgent measures introduced to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic have taken precedence. </p>  <p>  The proposals will need to be re-examined in light of current conditions. The cessation of services in March 2020 and recent resumption of car driver testing services from 16 July, has led to a backlog of people awaiting driving tests. The RSA is currently dealing with people in order of priority i.e. essential workers and those who had tests cancelled. Therefore, it would be prudent to delay any changes to regulations to make it mandatory for long term permit holders to sit a test until the driving test service has stabilised. The position will be kept under review.</p></reply>

However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during that period meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance and renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The main focus of grant funding under the National Development Plan (NDP) continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the regional and local road network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.  The NDP makes specific provision for the implementation of 12 RLR road improvement projects subject to necessary planning and project consents.

Self-employed owner operators of SPSVs may also avail of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.</p>  <p>  Over the past few months, the National Transport Authority (NTA), which is the body under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for regulating the SPSV sector, has undertaken a number of measures to assist operators in the industry including waivers, facilitating temporary licence suspensions, interaction with the Insurance industry, and providing guidance to operators on cleaning and other ways to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The focus now is on assisting those who have stopped working to get back to work as the economy reopens and passenger demand for SPSVs returns. My Department is in regular contact with the NTA to monitor the impact that the reopening of the economy in line with the Government's Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business is having on demand for SPSV services and to ensure that SPSV operators who have temporarily stopped working are well placed to return to work. Accordingly, there are no plans to halt accepting applicatons for taxi or other SPSV licences.</p></reply>

In 2010, while there was no general round of the Programme, allocations of &euro;13.4m were made to the National Governing Bodies of Sport and local authorities. The total amount allocated in 2015  was &euro;45.1m.</p>  <p>  No decisions have yet been made in regard to a round of the programme in 2020.

Sport Ireland is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards, including the allocation of funding across its various programmes. Current funding is provided to Sport Ireland to fund a wide range of programmes aimed at increasing participation and raising standards in Irish sport and to allocate funding to National Governing Bodies of Sport to enable them to develop their sport in a strategic manner. Capital funding is allocated to Sport Ireland for the development of the Sport Ireland National Sports Campus at Blanchardstown.  </p>  <p>  The total Exchequer allocation for Sport Ireland in 2020 is &euro;68.5m (&euro;65.6m current and &euro;2.9m capital funding).  Prior to Sport Ireland being established in 2015, the Irish Sports Council was part-funded by the proceeds of the National Lottery.  The total Exchequer allocation for the Irish Sports Council in 2005 was &euro;34.4m (current funding), in 2010 was &euro;49.5m (current funding) and for the Irish Sports Council/Sport Ireland in 2015 was &euro;42.5m (current funding).</p></reply>

In dealing with ADIs on COVID and indeed on other matters, it is important to note they are not employees or contractors of the RSA but are individual/independent commercial operators and businesses.  </p></reply>

The Department also informed the association that the process to recruit the additional independent directors must be initiated immediately after the date of rule change, and successfully concluded within 16 weeks of that date. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht Catherine Martin and the Minister of State with responsibility for Sport Jack Chambers met with the Board of the association mentioned by the Deputy on 27 July to confirm that they would not reopen for discussion any part of the MOU agreed by the previous Government. This followed a letter by Minister Martin and then Minister of State Dara Calleary confirming that the conditions for governance reform were essential to rebuild public trust and to enable the disbursement of the funding package set out in the MOU. The Ministers affirmed that no funding would be disbursed by the Department or Sport Ireland to the association until progress was made on key outstanding issues in the memorandum of understanding. The Ministers called on the Board to show leadership to deliver the necessary changes at an extraordinary general meeting convened as early as possible. The Ministers also confirmed their support for Sport Ireland to liaise with the association and verify implementation of the governance and financial control requirements as agreed in January.</p></reply>

This move toward evidence-based, plan-led strategic infrastructure development is in line with international best practice and allows for better integration of transport planning and land-use planning. Development of these transport strategies allows for full consideration of the potential for rail services in each metropolitan area and currently both the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area and the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy have extensive proposals for rail infrastructure improvements, while the Galway Transport Strategy calls for an increased frequency of rail services. I understand a draft Limerick-Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy will be published in August for public consultation while work has commenced on a Waterford Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy.</p>  <p>  In relation to intercity services, I can inform the Deputy that my Department is about to launch a significant procurement process in relation to a review of high-/higher-speed rail along the Belfast-Dublin-Cork/Limerick line, including how that line would interact with the broader network. This will be the most significant Departmental-led review of the intercity network since the Strategic Rail Review on 2003 and I very much look forward to is commencement in due course. </p></reply>

The offences specified include those made under Section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 which is the basis for the current Traffic and Parking Regulations covering, among other things, the offences mentioned by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  With regard to bus and cycle lane enforcement, my Department maintains that the success of such priority measures is an essential component in people moving from cars to more sustainable modes of transport, thereby reducing emissions and congestion.  It is therefore necessary to ensure that we have the best possible system for enforcement of the rules on both bus and cycle lanes, particularly in the context of BusConnects.  Officials in my Department are currently engaging with the National Transport Authority and other stakeholders to see how this can best be achieved, taking account of the robust existing provisions and without undermining their effectiveness.</p></reply>

It is important to recognise that successive governance reviews of the association referred to by the Deputy, dating back to 2002, recommended that a number of independent directors be appointed to the association&rsquo;s Board. It is regrettable that this was not implemented prior to last year when the association found itself in a profound crisis of governance. The Deputy is correct that the governance review commissioned by Sport Ireland and the association in question recommended that 4 independent directors, including an independent Chairperson, would be appointed to the association&rsquo;s Board, together with 8 directors appointed from within the association&rsquo;s governance structure. This recommendation was accepted by the association and the rulebook, memorandum and articles of association were amended accordingly.</p>  <p>  Between November 2019 and January of this year, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Shane Ross and the then Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Tourism and Sport Brendan Griffin, T.D. met on a number of occasions with delegations from the Board of the association concerned who were seeking emergency financial assistance to stave off the looming threat of insolvency. In January, the then Ministers informed the Board that any additional funding would be conditional on the association committing to further governance reforms, which would extend beyond the recommendations of the 2019 governance review, including a commitment to appoint additional independent directors. The Ministers made it clear that such conditionality was essential given that auditors instructed by Sport Ireland had found that the association was not fit to receive public funds. The Ministers advised that, as the State was being asked to provide a multi-annual funding commitment outside of the normal grant scheme for funding sporting bodies, a Government decision was required to authorise the Minister to make available the level of financial support required to safeguard the future of the association and its 203 employees. In seeking the agreement of Government to enter a funding agreement with the association concerned, the then Minister Shane Ross confirmed to his Cabinet colleagues that the association would be required to accept and fulfil a range of additional governance and financial control reforms in order to access Government funding. On that basis, the Minister was granted authority by the Government and duly signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chairperson of the association on 30 January.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will provide the Deputy with a full schedule of the then Ministers&rsquo; meetings with the Board of the association as well as copies of all correspondence between the Ministers and the association during the period in question.</p>  <p>  I would like to confirm to the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the MOU signed by my predecessor and, as my colleagues Minister Martin and Minister Calleary have confirmed in writing, we have no intention of renegotiating the terms of the MOU. I recognise that the governance changes required in the MOU go further than the requirements of the Sport Ireland Governance Code or the recommendations of the association&rsquo;s 2019 governance review. However, these conditions are essential to restore public confidence in the association, to safeguard the very considerable public funds which are to be disbursed and to ensure there is no return to the dysfunctional leadership which led the association to the brink of insolvency.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate, however, that I cannot comment on individual cases, and that the decision of an insurer not to provide insurance is a commercial decision based on the level of risk that the insurer is willing to take. As the Deputy will  also be aware, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to individual consumers.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. </p>  <p>  Government advice recommending that non-essential travel abroad is avoided remains, with all arrivals into Ireland (including those returning in relation to trips for essential work purposes) asked to restrict their movements on arrival, with the exception of those arriving from jurisdictions on the &lsquo;green list&rsquo; (or &lsquo;normal precautions&rsquo; list) prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs. I understand that Insurance Ireland has said that the main providers of travel insurance will now operate subject to normal terms and conditions for policyholders travelling to &lsquo;green list&rsquo; jurisdictions. However, it is important that consumers check with their insurance provider first before travelling to ensure they are comfortable with the level of cover they will have. In addition, it is important to note that the &lsquo;green list&rsquo; is due to be reviewed every two weeks, so some jurisdictions may be added as well as removed in accordance with the current epidemiological situation and related public health information in each jurisdiction. As such consumers are advised to maintain regular contact with their insurers on travel insurance matters.</p></reply>

The core principles of the scheme are that:</p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p>  <p>  - the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, and</p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted by the employer to Revenue before, in general, 15 March 2020 but this was later extended by Revenue to 1 April 2020. </p>  <p>  The latter two conditions were particularly designed to prevent abuse of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Employers who did not have employees on their payroll on 29 February 2020 do not meet the eligibility criteria for the TWSS in relation to those employees and, cannot qualify for the scheme in respect of the employees concerned. For employees who were working with the employer on that date, the amount of the wage subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported by the employer for January and February 2020. </p>  <p>  As part of the &lsquo;July Stimulus&rsquo; announced on 23 July, which has been published in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Bill 2020, the Government is introducing the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  The EWSS will deliver an enterprise support to employers based on business eligibility and will deliver a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis. It will not be linked to the average revenue net weekly pay which is currently the case for TWSS.</p>  <p>  The EWSS will replace the TWSS from 1 September. Both the TWSS and EWSS will run in parallel from 31 July until the TWSS expires at the end of August.  This is in order to provide additional flexibility to employers with new hires and seasonal workers who were not previously eligible to be paid via TWSS and who may now qualify for EWSS.</p>  <p>  The EWSS will be an economy-wide support, open to all sectors. The primary criterion for qualification is that the employer must demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% turnover from the period July to December 2020 compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a matter for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

Difficult discussions took place over four days but the Government welcomes this agreement. It is a fair and balanced outcome<b></b>and demonstrates that Europe can work collectively to deal with this once-in-a-generation crisis. Council conclusions set out the leaders&rsquo; agreement for the European Commission to borrow &euro;750 billion, supporting Member States with &euro;390 billion in grants and &euro;360 billion in loans. Agreement was also reached on a new Multiannual Financial Framework from 2021 &ndash; 2027, totalling &euro;1.074 trillion, which will support rural and regional development, and the transformation of our economies in line with the climate transition, research and development, and digital agendas.</p><p>Ireland has been a net contributor to the EU Budget since 2014, and this position is set to grow further over the course of the next MFF. Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the EU Budget are projected to increase considerably over the coming period in all scenarios as a result of economic growth in recent years.  <b></b></p><p>In May 2020, the European Commission produced a needs assessment underpinning the proposed &ldquo;Next Generation EU&rdquo;. In this needs assessment the European Commission estimate that Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the Next Generation EU package would be in the region of approximately &euro;18.7 billion over the next thirty years and estimated that Ireland would potentially receive a total of up to &euro;2 billion in grants, with a further &euro;1 billion in loans available up to 2024 should Ireland decide to borrow same. The needs assessment indicated that Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the &ldquo;Next Generation EU&rdquo; package would be the second highest in Net % GDP terms in the EU. The amounts in this needs assessment have been overtaken by European Council conclusions, as agreed by leaders on 21<sup>st</sup>July although Ireland remains a significant net contributor to the recovery fund. </p><p>Irish contributions to the EU budget are expected to rise over the coming MFF period from approximately &euro;3 billion in 2021, to over &euro;4 billion in 2027, an average of &euro;3.5 billion. Exact contributions to the repayment of NGEU borrowing are yet to be determined (and will depend on whether new Own Resources are agreed) but are expected to be significant.</p><p>At this time of crisis the Covid recovery funds are needed now, but will be paid back over 30+ years. It is important to remember that Ireland has benefitted greatly from EU membership in economic (single market access), social, environmental, and financial terms (net &euro;40+ billion receipts). We stand ready to demonstrate solidarity with those most in need now.</p><p>For the period 2021-2027 and consistent with the current MFF, lump-sum corrections will reduce the annual GNI-based contribution of Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden. Ireland did not seek such a lump sum contribution as it would not have been appropriate to do so.  </p><p>In respect of the final agreement by EU leaders, Ireland has:</p><p>- Protected the CAP Budget for Ireland and successfully reversed the damaging cuts proposed &ndash; including a special allocation of &euro;300 million in recognition of the challenges our agricultural sector is facing.</p><p>- Secured a significant &euro;5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve to address the impact on Member States and sectors most affected. The exact criteria for disbursements under the Reserve remain to be worked out but we will be working to ensure a significant share for Ireland and affected sectors.</p><p>- Secured an increase in the share of customs collection costs retained by Ireland (now 25%), will help address infrastructure and other Brexit costs.</p><p>- Secured significant EU funding for Ireland under the recovery plan to target the immediate response to the Covid crisis (ca. &euro;1.28 billion) in 2021/2022, with further funding in 2023 to be targeted at those most impacted economically by the crisis.</p><p>- Secured structural funds worth over a billion euro for our regions.</p><p>- Secured a special allocation of &euro;120 million for a new PEACE PLUS programme, to which Ireland and the UK will also contribute, to build and continue the work of the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes in a post-Brexit context.</p><p>- Also welcomed the strong climate target for EU funds (30% of total budget) in support of the Paris Agreement; the Just Transition Fund will benefit areas including the midlands.</p><p>- Secured very substantial budgets for other priority programmes: Horizon Europe, Erasmus+ and the EU&rsquo;s neighbourhood and development cooperation programme. Government will ensure that Departments and agencies work to make sure we maximise Irish draw-down from relevant programmes.</p></reply>

The SDGs are a global blueprint for collective progress to a more prosperous and sustainable world by 2030. The SDGs are applicable to all countries, developed and developing, and action is required for their implementation both domestically and internationally.</p><p>Ireland is committed to implementing the SDGs, and published its first SDG National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 in July 2018. While the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment  has lead responsibility for promoting and overseeing the coherent implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the whole-of-Government approach to implementation of the SDGs means all Ministers are responsible for implementing the SDGs related to their functions. The Department of Finance has been assigned responsibility for a number of goals and sub-targets, spanning from promoting inclusive economic growth to building partnerships for sustainable development. These responsibilities include targets under the following Goals where a lead or stakeholder role has been assigned </p><p><b>- Goal</b><b></b>End poverty in all its forms everywhere</p><p><b>- Goal 3</b>Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages (stakeholder role)</p><p><b>- Goal 8</b>Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all</p><p><b>- Goal 9</b>Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation</p><p><b>- Goal 10</b>Reduce inequality within and among countries</p><p><b>- Goal 12</b>Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns (stakeholder role)</p><p><b>- Goal 13</b>Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (stakeholder role)</p><p><b>- Goal 15</b>Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss (stakeholder role)</p><p><b>- Goal 17</b>Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development</p><p>A comprehensive list of these responsibilities is published in an Annex to the National Implementation Plan available at . I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue existing work in these areas, with a view to increasingly mainstreaming the SDGs into relevant policies.</p><p>Currently there are a number of channels through which my Department reports SDG progress. The Department of Finance complies with the National Implementation Plan requirement to provide information in its Annual Report on the implementation of relevant SDG targets.  As the Deputy may be aware, delivery on the SDGs is underpinned by an implementation and reporting process. Given the broad scope and cross-cutting nature of the SDGs, the Government has put in place strong and effective governance arrangements  which are essential to ensure high-level engagement with the 2030 Agenda and effective interdepartmental cooperation on the implementation of the Goals.  A Senior Officials Group (SOG) has been established to co-ordinate and monitor SDG implementation and to report, as required, to Government. The SOG is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. To further support the work of the SOG, an Interdepartmental SDG Working Group was established, comprised of representatives from all Departments with responsibilities for the SDGs. To accentuate the all-of-government approach and ensure policy coherence, my Department is supportive and fully engages with this SDG governance architecture. </p><p>My Department also continues to participate in SDG Stakeholders Forums. These events provides a opportunity to engage with stakeholders and civil society groups on an ongoing basis in relation to SDG implementation. These are all important channels of reporting and monitoring SDG progress. </p><p>Internationally, the UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF) is responsible for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda at the global level. The HLPF meets annually and features inputs from national governments, intergovernmental bodies, relevant UN agencies, civil society and other stakeholders.</p><p>Countries are encouraged to review implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) regularly and present Voluntary National Reviews (VNR) at the HLPF. Ireland presented its first VNR at the HLPF in July 2018. Having input into the first VNR, I expect my Department to be an active contributor in the next National Review in 2022. </p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that, as of 2020, the EU Semester process of Economic governance and coordination has a new focus on Green and Sustainable issues. This new focus takes account of the European Green Deal as Europe&rsquo;s new growth strategy, and incorporates the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals into all stages of the process. Progress towards achieving the UN SDG are monitored within this process using:</p><p>- The Country Report for each Member State which contains data  setting out the  progress in each Member State across the 17 SDGs towards achieving these Goals by 2030, and</p><p>- Each Member State&rsquo;s National Reform Programme assesses performance in implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>These documents are publicly available as soon as they are published.</p><p>Looking forward, I wish to confirm to the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy  is currently under review. In preparing the revised Strategy I wish to assure that Deputy that this review will take cognisance my Department&rsquo;s SDG responsibilities, seeking to enhance policy coherence and alignment and mainstream SDGs into policy areas. Increasing this integration will ensure that aside from the modalities of communicating progress I have already outlined, the reporting of my Department&rsquo;s performance towards its strategic objectives will be synchronous with  progress toward SDG delivery.</p></reply>

Therefore, the intention of the scheme is that the house would not have been completed when applying for the HTB scheme.</p>  <p>  The HTB scheme has been widely publicised since its announcement in 2016, particularly by financial institutions providing mortgages. Revenue does not have discretion to vary the conditions for qualification for relief under the HTB scheme.  However, if there are unique circumstances which has prevented an individual from claiming the HTB scheme, the taxpayer should contact Revenue with the relevant circumstances and each case will be considered on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

In May 2020, the European Commission produced a needs assessment underpinning the proposed &ldquo;Next Generation EU&rdquo;. In this needs assessment the European Commission estimated that Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the Next Generation EU package would in the region of approximately &euro;18.7 billion over the next thirty years and estimated that Ireland may potentially receive a total of up to &euro;2 billion in grants, with a further &euro;1 billion in loans available up to 2024 should Ireland decide to borrow same. However, these amounts were overtaken by the European Council agreement of 21 July 2020. </p><p>We will need to see the European Commission&rsquo;s official allocation for Member States, but at this point Ireland&rsquo;s estimated grant allocation amounts to &euro;1.278 billion made up of:</p><p>- &euro;177m EAFRD allocation</p><p>- &euro;204m React EU </p><p>- &euro;44m Just Transition Fund</p><p>- &euro;853m Recovery and Resilience Facility (This is only 70% of the total amount available under this Facility, with potential additional grant allocation from the remaining 30% of the Facility to be allocated in 2023 &ndash; this could potentially be in the region of a further &euro;300m)</p><p>In terms of loans under the NGEU, we estimate that Ireland could potentially avail of approximately &euro;1.4 billion.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to the EU Budget are projected to increase considerably over the coming period in all scenarios as a result of economic growth in recent years.<b></b>Irish contributions to the EU budget are expected to rise over the coming MFF period from approximately &euro;3 billion in 2021, to over &euro;4 billion in 2027, an average of &euro;3.5 billion.  </p><p>Exact contributions to the repayment of NGEU borrowing are yet to be determined (and will depend on whether new Own Resources are agreed) but are expected to be significant.

In this context, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Central Bank has also advised that it continues to monitor this situation and the impact of COVID-19 very closely to ensure that lenders are continuing to take a consumer-focused approach and are acting in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times.  </p><p>Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Indeed, the three main retail banks assured the T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister McGrath and me at meetings the week before last that they are considering applications and mortgage drawdowns from customers on the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis. The BPFI has published a Covid-19 support information document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.</p><p>However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework governing the provision of mortgages, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard.  Also it may be the case that a loan offer from a lender may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if, in the lender&rsquo;s opinion, there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.</p><p>Regarding the regulations governing mortgage credit, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, require lenders to make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  The Regulations further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower and in this regard I welcome the recent statement from the pillar banks that they will assess mortgage applications from people in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy scheme on a case by case basis. </p><p>However, if a consumer if not satisfied with the way a regulated entity is dealing with his/her mortgage application or drawdown then, under the provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code, s/he can make a complaint to the lender.  If the consumer is still unhappy with the position following the outcome of the internal complaints process, then s/he can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  Clear information on how to make a complaint to the FSPO may be found at this link: </p><p>.</p></reply>

In addition, the Government has no direct influence over award levels, as awards are a matter for the Judiciary.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue.  What is needed is for the ongoing reform measures to be implemented and to quickly bear fruit.  In this regard, the new Programme for Government identifies a range of issues that the Government will prioritise so as to benefit consumers including small businesses such as those in the leisure sector throughout the country.  This cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which I believe builds and expands upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, is a priority for this Government and in particular for my Department.  </p>  <p>  In terms of addressing insurance premiums for small businesses, particularly those in the leisure sector, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council in December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council by 28 October. The guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of awards by the courts. Insurance Ireland has commented that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members. I believe that this is a very important statement and the  Government intends holding the insurance industry to account on this matter.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that insurance reform remains a priority for the Government and as noted above this is reflected in the Program for Government.  This is an issue that I, as Minister for Finance, along with Minister of State Fleming in my Department, will focus on.  In doing so we will be working closely with An Tanaiste and a number of other of our Ministerial colleagues given the cross-Departmental nature of prioritising the Programme for Government commitments on insurance reform.</p></reply>

However, the holding of a &ldquo;Certificate of Notification&rdquo; from the HSE does not serve as evidence that a provider is providing home care services that qualify for exemption from VAT. To establish if a supply is taxable or exempt, each supply must be looked at on its own merits. Detailed information is available on the Revenue website in relation to VAT and the Provision of Home Care Services. If a provider has any doubts about whether their supply is taxable or exempt, they should contact Revenue.</p></reply>

This is why Ireland was among a number of EU Member States which opposed an EU Digital Services Tax when it was first proposed in 2018. The European Commission withdrew its proposal in early 2019 and have committed to supporting the ongoing discussions at OECD.  </p>  <p>  The OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework is due to publish an update on its ongoing work to address tax and digitalisation in October.  I am not aware of any plans to relaunch the EU Digital Services Tax proposal while discussions at the OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework remain underway.</p></reply>

Council conclusions agreed to borrow &euro;750 billion, supporting Member States with &euro;390 billion in grants and &euro;360 billion in loans. Agreement was also reached on a new Multiannual Financial Framework, totalling &euro;1.074 trillion, which will support rural and regional development, and the transformation of our economies in line with the climate transition, research and development, and digital agendas.</p><p>I welcome the fact that we have substantially protected the CAP Budget for Ireland and successfully reversed the damaging cuts proposed two years ago. The package agreed includes a special allocation of &euro;300 million for Ireland in recognition of challenges facing our agricultural sector. I also welcome the inclusion of a significant Brexit Adjustment Reserve worth &euro;5 billion to help cushion the impact on those Member States and sectors most affected by Brexit.</p><p>Ireland is to receive significant EU funding under the recovery plan to target the immediate response to the Covid crisis &ndash; approximately &euro;1.28 billion in 2021/2022, with further funding in 2023 to be targeted at those most impacted economically by the crisis. </p><p>It is especially welcome that a special allocation of &euro;120 million for a new PEACE PLUS programme, to which Ireland and the UK will also contribute, will build a significant fund to further reconciliation and North-South cooperation. This will continue the work of the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes in a post-Brexit context.</p><p>In terms of Own Resources, I specifically welcome the retention of the VAT based Own Resource, and also welcome the increase in the share of customs collection costs retained by Ireland from 20% to 25%, which will help address the cost of custom infrastructure and other Brexit related costs.</p><p>It is also welcome that we have achieved substantial budgets for other priority programmes such as Horizon Europe, Erasmus+ and the EU&rsquo;s neighbourhood and development cooperation programme.

These commitments include increasing transparency; reviewing duty of care legislation; looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and increasing competition in the market.  Making progress on this work will involve a cross-departmental approach and will build and expand upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.</p>  <p>  In terms of discussions with other Ministers, there have been two meetings to date. Firstly, a Ministerial meeting was held on the 14th July, where the Tanaiste and relevant Ministers discussed how best to implement the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda in a coordinated fashion in order to ensure maximum effect and benefit for insurance policyholders.  Most recently, on the 22nd July, a meeting took place between the Alliance for Insurance Reforms, An T&aacute;naiste Varadkar, Ministers McEntee and McGrath, Ministers of State Fleming and Troy and myself. The meeting with the Alliance was a productive engagement for all sides. </p>  <p>  Our focus at present is on defining each Department&rsquo;s priorities in terms of being able to progress this reform agenda in an effective and coherent way over the next number of months. My Department has written to each relevant Department on this matter. In terms of timelines, I cannot give a definitive answer at this stage, other than to say that every effort will be made to advance it as quickly as possible. In addition, a meeting between myself, Minister of State Fleming and Insurance Ireland is also being arranged so that we can assess their views on where progress can be made.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Deputy can rest assured that making progress on achieving much needed insurance reform is a key priority for this Government and this is reflected in the Programme for Government.  While implementation of this agenda is a cross-Departmental priority the overall issue remains a key issue for myself and Minister of State Fleming in my Department.</p></reply>

They are available to anyone regardless of employment status. The relevant legislation setting out the treatment of PRSAs is contained in Chapter 2A of Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.  Except in limited circumstances, benefits cannot be drawn down until the individual is at least 60 years of age. </p>  <p>  An &ldquo;imputed distribution&rdquo; regime applies to Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) and &ldquo;vested&rdquo; Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs). This regime was extended to vested PRSAs by Budget and Finance Act 2012. When it was originally introduced by Finance Act 2006, it only applied to ARFs. The reason for the introduction of this regime was because many ARF and PRSA owners were not using these funds as intended i.e. to provide an income stream in retirement, but instead as a form of tax-efficient estate planning. </p>  <p>  Under the current rules, ARFs and vested PRSAs are subject to a taxable minimum drawdown requirement which varies between 4 per cent and 6 per cent of the value of the assets in the ARF or PRSA. The percentage depends on the individual&rsquo;s age and the overall size of the fund. PRSA funds can usually only be accessed from the age of 60, except in certain circumstances. If the person is under 70 and their fund is below &euro;2 million in value, then the required annual distribution is 4 per cent of the assets in the fund. If the person is aged over 70 with a fund below &euro;2 million, the distribution is 5 per cent of the assets in the fund. If the fund is over &euro;2 million in value, a 6 per cent distribution applies, irrespective of the age of the individual.</p>  <p>  A vested PRSA is a PRSA from which assets are available to the PRSA owner or any other person &ndash; in general this is in the form of benefits taken from age 60. So long as a PRSA remains unvested, it can continue to build up tax-free and is not subject to the imputed distribution requirement. In addition, by not vesting the PRSA, the rate of imputed distribution on any ARF(s) and/or other vested PRSA(s) which the individual has, can be kept to a minimum.</p>  <p>  On actual drawdown a pension is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal tax rate. The policy rationale underpinning this is that the State provides generous tax relief on both pension contributions and fund growth to ensure that people have sufficient savings to fund their regular costs and expenses during their retirement. It is a form of tax deferral and the income tax and USC paid upon drawdown of a pension are generally lower than the income tax and USC the individual would have paid during their working life. </p>  <p>  Finance Act 2016 made a number of amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in order to prevent certain tax avoidance opportunities in relation to PRSAs. A situation was arising where the funds in non-vested PRSAs, on the death of the owner, were being transferred to his or her estate tax-free and, under Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) rules, would pass to any surviving spouse tax-free. This was not the intention of PRSA provision &ndash; the intention is that when individuals drawdown pension benefits they will pay income tax and the Universal Social Charge (USC).</p>  <p>  The changes made in Finance Act 2016 only affects people who, by their 75th birthday, have not taken benefits from their PRSA. Until their 75th birthday they are under no obligation to drawdown any benefits.  The amendments ensure that, where benefits are not taken by the PRSA owner on or before his or her 75th birthday, they will be treated as being taken on that date and, therefore, the PRSA will be treated as &ldquo;vesting&rdquo; on that date. From the owner&rsquo;s 75th birthday, the PRSA assets are subject to the imputed distribution regime that applies to vested PRSAs (and Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs)). They are also treated as a benefit crystallisation event occurring on that date for the purposes of the Standard Fund Threshold regime (which effectively places a lifetime benefit limit of &euro;2 million on an individual&rsquo;s tax relieved pension fund). Finally, they are treated on the death of the PRSA owner under the provisions relating to ARFs and not by way of a transfer of the PRSA assets to the deceased owner&rsquo;s estate. </p>  <p>  At this time I have no plans to make changes to this policy.</p></reply>

The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle.</p>  <p>  REITs are publicly listed companies - therefore distributions are dividends within the scope of Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT).  From 1 January 2020 a DWT rate of 25% applies. Prior to this date dividends paid and distributions made were liable to DWT at 20%.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that information in respect of dividends from shares in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) is not separately identified in Revenue&rsquo;s Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) data and therefore the information requested by the Deputy cannot be provided. In addition, due to information not being available in relation to potential future REIT distributions to investors, an accurate estimate of any potential revenue from an increase in the withholding tax rate could not be made.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments were made to the taxation of REITs in Finance Act 2019, to ensure the regime operates as intended. The obligation to deduct DWT has been extended to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. If the net proceeds from such capital disposals are not re-invested in the REIT business or distributed within a 2 year period, they will become part of the profits of the REIT business, 85% of which must be distributed annually. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status have been restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. </p>  <p>  Finance Act 2019 also provided for the introduction of a &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; test when calculating the REIT profits available for distribution. This test has been introduced to ensure that inflated costs, such as inflated management fees, cannot be used to reduce distributable profits. An expense will only be deductible if it is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the REIT&rsquo;s business. Any deductions found to be excessive will be chargeable to tax as Case IV income in the hands of the REIT.</p></reply>

The legislation was introduced to address concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-residents to invest in Irish property.  </p>  <p>  Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place. Non-resident investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of IREF withholding tax if the relevant tax treaty allows for this. Irish resident investors may be subject to the investment undertakings exit tax, at a rate of 41%.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of amendments were made to the taxation of IREFs in Finance Act 2019. Amendments were made to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. In addition, the IREF return filing requirement was placed on a mandatory annual footing and the information which Revenue can request was increased to facilitate ongoing monitoring of the sector. These amendments were made to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property.</p>  <p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that due to the interaction with tax treaties, the taxation of distributions which varies from treaty to treaty, and because information is not available in relation to potential future IREF distributions to investors, an accurate estimate of any potential revenue from an increase in the withholding tax rates cannot be made.</p></reply>

The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there is no reliable basis available to Revenue on which to estimate the potential cost of the introduction of a tax relief as described by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  The annual cost of such a tax credit, operating on a refundable basis, would depend on the number of those renting, other than those who are in receipt of rental support from the State, and the amount of rent paid by them each year.  </p>  <p>  According to Census 2016 data, the private rented sector amounts to approximately 310,000 units.  This figure includes those in receipt of rental support from the State. </p>  <p>  It is clear, therefore, that the costs involved would be likely to be very significant.</p></reply>

It was re-introduced in Finance Bill 2017 to effect a smoothing of corporate tax receipts over time. It also supports sustainability of CT receipts by extending the period over which the allowances are used.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the cap only affects the timing of relief in the form of capital allowances and related interest expenses for intangible assets. It does not affect the overall quantum of relief. This is because any amounts restricted in one accounting period as a result of a cap are available for carry forward and utilisation in a subsequent accounting period, subject to the application of the cap in that period. Therefore, no additional tax revenue would be raised in the long-term through the Deputy's proposal. </p>  <p>  It has been tentatively estimated, based on the levels of capital allowance claims in tax returns for recent years, that there could be a cash flow benefit in the region of &euro;720 million if intangible assets onshored between 2015 and 11 October 2017 were subject to the 80% cap. However, this estimate is based on a number of assumptions and there are a range of factors which would affect its accuracy.  For example, the estimate assumes that the cap would be relevant to all claimants, but this may not be the case where income generated by the assets exceeds the available allowances.  Furthermore, in some cases the cap may no longer be of relevance as the full amount of the relief may have already been claimed.  It should also be noted that this estimate assumes no behavioural change on the part of the companies involved.  </p>  <p>  It is also very important to be clear that this simply a timing matter - to present this as potential additional tax for the Exchequer would not be correct. Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, changes to tax law are generally made on a prospective basis, such that they apply only from the date on which they have legal effect.  </p></reply>

If the restrictions suggested by the Deputy were introduced, the Exchequer impact would depend on the future profitability of banks as this would determine their capacity to utilise their losses within the restricted time-frame. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify the estimated additional corporation tax revenue from the measures referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>I believe that a restriction of the nature proposed would give rise to consequences that would make it difficult for me to fulfil other objectives in respect of the Irish banking system. Such a change could have knock on implications for the cost of lending and deposits for consumers and businesses in Ireland. </p><p>It is important to understand that the State is actually getting value today from these deferred tax assets through our share sales. Should a restriction as proposed be introduced, it could be expected that the value of the State&rsquo;s remaining shareholdings in the banks would decrease due to write-downs in the value of those deferred tax assets. The State is a substantial owner of these banks and what is detrimental to their balance sheets is also detrimental to the State&rsquo;s investment.</p><p>It is also the case that such a restriction would damage the State&rsquo;s credibility with investors. Tax losses forward are included as a deferred tax asset on a company&rsquo;s balance sheet and AIB&rsquo;s return to the stock market in 2017 was on the basis that those deferred tax assets could be crystallised if AIB realised sufficient profits in the future. </p><p>Finally, the banks are also contributing to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy, introduced in 2013, which has generated an annual yield of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer.</p><p>These considerations are discussed in further detail in a 2018 technical note on the potential consequences of changes to the treatment of corporation tax loss relief in respect of the banks, prepared for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, available online at: .</p></reply>

The levy is intended to raise a fixed annual amount of &euro;150M. The amount of the levy paid by a particular financial institution must therefore change whenever the base year changes.  A change in the base year necessitates a change in the rate of the levy to ensure that the overall fixed amount of the yield is maintained.</p>  <p>  In relation to the years 2017 and 2018, a rate of 59% was required to yield &euro;150M based on the financial institutions&rsquo; DIRT liability for the base year 2015.  The year 2017 is the current base year used to determine the levy for the years 2019 and 2020.  As there was a substantial fall in DIRT payable by financial institutions since 2015 the rate was increased from 59% to 170% to maintain the &euro;150M yield. Following a continuing fall in DIRT payable since 2017, the change to the next base year of 2019, in relation to the levy payable for the year 2021, will necessitate a further rate increase. I am advised by Revenue that it expects that the rate will have to increase from 170% to 308% to maintain the &euro;150M annual yield for the year 2021.  An increase in the current rate of 170% by each of 10 percentage points or by 10% would therefore not yield any additional revenue but would instead result in a reduced yield.</p></reply>

Within this, the cost of regulating Credit Unions is estimated at approximately &euro;14m. Based on a 20% recovery rate, a subvention amount of &euro;11.2m arises &ndash; the highest subvention and lowest funding rate applicable to any industry category.  The remaining subvention of &euro;33.2m reflects categories that are moving towards but are not yet at 100% funding and some costs relate to legacy Inquiries and Markets Supervision which are not recharged to industry.</p><p>If industry was fully charged, there would be no subvention, however, there are certain costs (e.g. markets supervision) which it may be appropriate to continue to subvent on an ongoing basis where the costs cannot be attributed to specific firms but do relate to the orderly function of markets and the financial stability agenda.</p><p>As you will recall, in 2015, the Department of Finance and Central Bank of Ireland issued a joint public consultation on &lsquo;Funding the cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95).  </p><p>In response to that consultation, my predecessor as Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, agreed to a phased movement towards 100 per cent Industry Funding in order to eliminate subvention, by the taxpayer, of regulatory costs. Since then, recovery rates have increased in stages across most industry sectors, determined on a yearly basis. In April 2019, in order to give greater clarity to industry, I approved the trajectory to bring the recovery rate of levies across sectors to 100 per cent over the coming years.  This change in policy will apply the user pays principle to the regulation of financial services.</p><p>The table below shows the planned trajectory for levy rates across all sectors. Credit Union recovery rates from 2022 onwards will be subject to review and a public consultation to guide strategy once 50% recovery rates have been achieved. </p><p>The Central Bank published this trajectory on 14 June 2019 and it is available on the Central Bank website at the following link: </p><p>. <table>    <tr>       <th>Levy Year</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>2022 </th>       <th>2023 </th>       <th>2024 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Levied   in  </td>       <td>2017</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2021</td>       <td>2022</td>       <td>2023</td>       <td>2024</td>       <td>2025</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ELG Banks</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Banks</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Insurance Undertakings</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Investment   Firms &amp;amp; Fund Service Providers</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Funds</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Retail   Intermediaries &amp;amp; Debt Management Co&rsquo;s</td>       <td>50%</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>70%</td>       <td>75%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Moneylenders</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>70%</td>       <td>75%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Approved   Professional Bodies</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>70%</td>       <td>75%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bureau de   Change/Money Transmitters</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>70%</td>       <td>75%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Retail   Credit / Home Reversion / Credit Servicing Firms</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>70%</td>       <td>75%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Payment   &amp;amp; EMoney Institutions</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>65%</td>       <td>70%</td>       <td>75%</td>       <td>80%</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>100%</td>       <td>100%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>From this year, in response to industry feedback, invoices for levies will issue on an arrears basis as the Central Bank implements its strategy to move from levies based on budgeted figures to levies based on actual costs.  Invoices for 2019 levies will issue in Q3 2020 and businesses were advised to accrue for 2019 costs in their financial statement. This addresses an aspect of volatility by eliminating large balancing surpluses and deficits in favour of levies based on the Central Bank&rsquo;s audited financial statements.</p><p>Finally, the Funding Strategy and Guide to the 2018 Industry Funding Regulations guide (available at the link below) may also be helpful. It is planned to issue an updated guide in advance of the issue of 2019 levies invoices.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-28a.677.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072800113#WRO04200"><p>I am aware that there have been many concerns expressed about how the insurance industry is responding to the needs of its business policyholders in these difficult times, including in terms of honouring business interruption claims. At the outset, I should remind the Deputy that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can direct or require that insurers cover claims, including those resulting from infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Furthermore, it is not a matter for the Government or Central Bank of Ireland to adjudicate on the validity of such claims.</p><p>Whether a business can make a claim in relation to loss of earnings because of closure due to COVID-19 will depend on the specifics of its policy. I have made it very clear as a general rule insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  I believe that insurers should engage with those businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code..  </p><p>I understand, however, that many businesses do not routinely have infectious diseases covered as part of their standard policies.  In the case where infectious diseases are covered, there may be other considerations which will influence the decision of an insurer to not pay a claim. It is important therefore for businesses to engage directly with their insurer or broker on this matter, and where they believe an insurer has incorrectly rejected their claim, they should either consider referring the matter to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) for adjudication or where their claim is in excess of the FSPO &euro;3 million limit they may wish to consider legal action. I understand that this is already happening in a number of cases.</p><p>The above said however, my officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much-needed certainty for business policyholders. On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on 27 March and indicated amongst other things that</p><p>(i)insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage; and,</p><p>(ii)that where a claim can be made because a business has closed as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.</p><p>Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on 3 April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close.  Following on from this correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on 17 April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly.  </p><p>The Deputy should also note that the Central Bank wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. This included the Bank&rsquo;s belief that while most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. The Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.</p><p>The Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to monitor the business interruption issue and will engage appropriately with the Central Bank of Ireland on the matter. This issue is recognised in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s extensive cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which amongst other things seeks to address consumer and business concerns on the cost and availability of insurance by building on the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group. </p><p>Furthermore, the Government has made available multiple supports to businesses as part of the July Jobs Stimulus and I would encourage the Deputy to direct his constituents to the relevant Government website: .</p></reply>

The Statement of Strategy will map out the risks, challenges and opportunities that will shape the Department&rsquo;s operating environment and set out the actions, outputs and outcomes for the Department for the next three years. Implementation of the Statement of Strategy will be underpinned by Annual Business Plans, which will set out in detail how the Department will deliver on its key priorities for each year. Key developments and achievements each year will be set out in the Department&rsquo;s Annual Reports. The Statement of Strategy will take account of the policy commitments contained in the &ldquo;Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future&rdquo; relevant to the Department.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to developing a set of wellbeing indicators to give a more rounded, holistic view of how our society is faring.  The development of this work will be informed by the experience of other jurisdictions which have developed similar measures in recent years. The Programme for Government outlines that through the Department of the Taoiseach, a group of experts will be convened from the public service, academia, NGOs, and the private sector to guide this work. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals combine to form a comprehensive framework that can be used to gauge progress in countries across the world; these goals can certainly play a part in informing the process of selecting wellbeing indicators for Ireland. </p>  <p>  Through my Department's responsibility for Performance and Equality budgeting, work is already underway in examining the latest developments in the wellbeing sphere &ndash; the Sustainable Development Goals are one example of this international best practice. Leveraging experience in identifying metrics which maximise transparency and accountability, and utilising the guidance we provide to line departments in identifying the most appropriate measures to scrutinise public expenditure, I envisage that my Department will play a key role in working with the Department of the Taoiseach in delivering this work.</p></reply>

The Cycle to Work Scheme operates by way of a salary sacrifice and may also be used towards the cost of an electric bike. </p>  <p>  Where an officer uses their own bicycle for official travel, they may claim mileage at a rate of 8 cent per kilometre. I am aware that this rate has been in place since 2007 and was determined by reference to annual wear and tear, the average cost of a bicycle, depreciation, maintenance, cleaning and repairs, and protective clothing applying at that stage.

This increased to 41 per cent for the 2020 Barometer. Trust in Business and NGOs also increased, to 48 per cent and 54 per cent respectively. </p><p>It is essential that citizens have trust in Government. Trust in Government is also essential in underpinning  the policies and legislation that are adopted by the State to meet the challenges faced by society as a whole.</p><p>In relation to reform and how it can support trust in government, initiatives have addressed areas such as the capacity of the civil service and the conduct of politics. </p><p><b>Capacity of the Civil Service</b></p><p>The challenge of maintaining trust in the Irish Civil Service was highlighted as a key challenge in the Civil Service Renewal Plan 2014. Since the publication of this plan various actions have been progressed aimed at building public trust: </p><p>- The development of a common Corporate Governance Standard for the Civil Service;</p><p>- Progression of Employee Engagement Surveys across the Civil Service; </p><p>- Organisation of 46 Open Policy Debates involving stakeholders across various policy areas; </p><p>- A system of Organisational Capability Reviews to assess and strengthen performance and capacity across Departments is being implemented;  </p><p>- Improvements to how data is collected, managed and stored through the National Data Infrastructure project. </p><p>Digital transformation is also central to the reform of the Civil and Public Service, and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (which is a Division of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform) is leading this agenda.  While substantial progress has been made, especially over the last two to three years, further acceleration will be a primary focus.  </p><p>Digital is also a key theme at international and EU level.  Even before Covid-19, the OECD had noted that digitisation is changing the way people live, interact and work, which affects the relationship between governments and citizens and requires a transformation of how public services are designed and delivered. The dividends from meeting such expectations will include efficiency, transparency, trust, and inclusion </p><p>The next phase of Civil Service Renewal is currently in development and will contain further actions  to empower  the Civil Service to respond quickly to change whilst ensuring accountability and high performance. These actions will aim to build accountability, to develop trust and provide ambitious leadership to support openness. </p><p><b>Political Reform </b></p><p>A substantial body of legislation has been enacted by recent Governments in areas such as Protected Disclosures, Freedom of Information, Regulation of Lobbying and Oireachtas Inquiries in order to strengthen public confidence in our public administration and the structures of Government.  Tasks currently being  progressed include transposition into Irish law of the EU Whistleblowing Directive and implementation of the Data Sharing and Governance Act. </p><p>At present, the main legislation regulating the ethical conduct of public officials is <b>The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995</b>, as amended by the Standards in Public Office Act 2001. This legislation provides for the disclosure of registrable interests by members of the Oireachtas and public servants and for investigation of possible non-compliance with the legislation. It provides for the publication of Codes of Conduct for office holders, for ordinary members of the D&aacute;il, for ordinary members of the Seanad and for public servants, and also a requirement that members of the Oireachtas and appointees to senior office in the public service furnish evidence of tax compliance. </p><p>The <b>Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015</b>was commenced on 1 September 2015. It is designed to provide appropriate transparency on 'who is lobbying whom about what', and allows all sections of society to reach informed evidence-based judgments regarding the extent to which different interest groups are able to access the decision-making processes. The Act sets out arrangements for bringing transparency to lobbying activities through a web-based register. For further details, see: <i>.</i>Provisions in the Act regarding enforcement commenced on the 1<sup>st</sup>January 2017. </p><p>The <b>Programme for Government</b>contains  commitments in relation toboth ethics and lobbying legislation.  </p><p>The <b>Standards in Public Office Commission</b>is responsible for regulatory functions in relation to the above legislation, including maintaining and publishing relevant registers, and investigating complaints. For further details, see: .  </p><p>To further promote transparency and accountability, a modernised, consolidated, restructured, more accessible <b>Freedom of Information Act 2014 </b>was introduced in October 2014. The 2014 Act made a significant number of additional bodies subject to the FOI, now approaching some 600 organisations.  The Information Commissioner, an independent statutory officer, is responsible for carrying out reviews of decisions made under the Act as well as oversight of the operation of this legislation. For further details, see:  .</p><p><b>The Protected Disclosures Act 2014</b>provides robust statutory protections for workers in both the public and private sectors against the real or potential penalisation by their employers where they have brought concerns about wrongdoing in the workplace to light (whistleblowing). The Workplace Relations Commission has developed a statutory code of practice on the Act (S.I. No. 464 of 2015). For further information on the Protected Disclosures Act, see: http://www.per.gov.ie/en/protected-disclosures-i-e-whistleblowing/.  The transposition into Irish law of the EU Whistleblowing Directive is currently being progressed.  </p><p>Significant changes were made to the process of <b>State board appointments</b>during 2014, with the broad objectives of providing access to State board opportunities to as wide a pool of candidates as possible, strengthening the performance of State boards by identifying and securing high-quality membership, and attaining a high level of transparency in the selection and appointment of board members by Ministers. For further details, see: .</p><p>Finally, I would also like to mention Our Public Service 2020 (OPS2020). This is  the framework for development and innovation in Ireland&rsquo;s public service. Our Public Service 2020 has an outcomes-driven focus, and has been designed to enable public service organisations to deliver better outcomes for the public.  Our Public Service 2020 has identified six high-level outcomes including &lsquo;increased public trust.&rsquo; A review of OPS2020 will inform the development of the successor framework- OPS2030.  </p><p>It is considered that Ireland is well positioned to be a global leader in building greater trust between Government and its citizens. Ireland scored well above the European average on our public service values in the Public Sector Trends&rsquo; report (Public Sector Trends, Boyle, Institute of Public Administration 2019) -  providing Ireland with  a strong platform to lead by example.</p></reply>

Inclusion of social considerations has been specifically allowed for in the 2014 EU Directives on Public Procurement. As transposed, the 2016 Regulations require tenderers to comply with obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law that apply at the place where the works are carried out or the services provided and that have been established by European Union law, national law, enforceable national collective agreements or by international, environmental, social and labour law.  The agreements and conventions which can be found in our national public procurement guidelines include, inter alia, the ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise and the ILO Convention 98 on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement established the cross Departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group in March 2019, bringing together officials from policy Departments to share best practice and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement. This cross-departmental group met three times in 2019.  Due to the impact of Covid-19, it has been unable to meet so far this year.  However, the OGP has held bilateral meetings and maintained contact with members throughout.  Members are in the process of identifying appropriate social policy objectives in which social considerations can be advanced through the group.  In addition to the work of the Social Considerations Advisory Group, officials from the OGP have also engaged in bilateral meetings with Government Departments and promoted the inclusion of social considerations in public procurement at number of procurement related events. </p>  <p>  The OGP published Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement in October 2019. The Circular highlights opportunities for Departments to deliver wider social and environmental aims through public procurement including in relation to employment and training opportunities for disadvantaged groups, disability access, promoting social inclusion and social enterprises.</p>  <p>  The Circular was the latest in a series of measures following publication of the Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement in December 2018.  The Information Note assists policy makers and practitioners in understanding how public procurement can be used to facilitate the advancement of existing social policy objectives as well as the wider context and implications of including them in particular public procurement projects.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the OGP cannot decide for other contracting authorities, or at a whole-of-Government level, what social considerations should be included in the frameworks and contracts that it puts in place on their behalf.  The OGP requires guidance from policy departments (and Government approval as appropriate) as well as the agreement of individual contracting authorities who are responsible for managing their own contracts and the associated costs. The appropriateness of including social considerations needs to be examined on a contract-by-contract basis and there needs to be sufficient flexibility to allow each individual contracting authority to decide what, how, and when social considerations can be used. The OGP facilitates the process of incorporating those objectives, once agreed, into planned procurement projects.</p>  <p>  The Government has set out a number of commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to public procurement including evaluating and managing the environmental, economic and social impacts of procurement strategies within the state.

Setting minimum standards for Project Briefs;</p><p>2. Establishing standard definitions for the scope of services required from the main consultancy appointments;</p><p>3. Linking the fee makeup to the scope of services;</p><p>4. Introducing clear reporting lines for each member of the design team with a particular focus on cost reporting.</p><p>Work is ongoing on the detailed implementation aspects which will be delivered throughout 2020 by means of changes to the template tender documents, publication of new guidance material and exploring digital solutions to the presentation of 2) and 3) above.</p><p>- A review of the price variation mechanisms used in both the CWMF consultancy and construction contracts is currently underway.  </p><p>- Extensive engagement has taken place with the NSAI and other stakeholders in developing technical standards which will enable public bodies to procure Building Information Modelling services in a consistent manner across the NDP.  An implementation plan for the adoption of BIM will be launched shortly setting out dates for a phased adoption of BIM.  </p><p>- The OGP is engaging with key stakeholders on the issue of liability, indemnities and insurance and is also reviewing broader aspects of the required terms in the contracts used to engage design teams and contractors.  A number of meetings have been held in February/March with further engagement necessary before a position paper is prepared for consultation purposes.</p><p>- Engagement is ongoing in developing standard metrics for life cycle costing and life cycle analysis that can be applied to the evaluation of projects&rsquo; cost of use in service and full life cycle analysis, including the carbon impact of individual projects.  The OGP is liaising with the GCCC and the Irish Green Building Council in developing these metrics.  A position paper will be published in Q4 of 2020 for public consultation.</p><p>- The Cost Control Templates published under the CWMF are undergoing review to incorporate the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS).  A working group has been established and revised templates will be published in Q3 of 2020. ICMS is a global standard for benchmarking and reporting of construction project cost and covers both capital and whole life costing while providing a way of presenting costs in a consistent format.</p></reply>

A new public procurement model was established to deliver a more-centralised model of procurement for commonly sourced goods and services across the public service. </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) was established in 2014 to drive the reform programme through the provision of policy interventions, advice and guidance, through the development of procurement solutions such as framework agreements, and through the analysis of public expenditure and tendering activity.  Since then, significant progress has been made in enabling value-for-money, supporting compliant procurement, promoting SME participation, increasing communication and guidance, professionalising the practice of public procurement, and promoting transparency.  Results from an independent survey of Government Departments and public bodies in 2018 recorded a high level of satisfaction with the services of the OGP.</p>  <p>  The interim Procurement Reform Board (the Board) brings together representatives from across the OGP&rsquo;s client bodies, its sector partners in Health, Education, Local Government and Defence, as well as independent external representatives. The Board oversees the procurement reform programme across the public service and the work of the OGP and promotes engagement with the new arrangements.  The head of OGP, who is Government&rsquo;s Chief Procurement Officer, is also a member of the Board.  In 2019, the Board presented an annual report detailing its work in 2018 to me and I have published it.  The Board expects to present its annual report for 2019 in the near future and I will again publish that. </p>  <p>  Under the guidance of the Board, the OGP is leading on further possible reforms and is considering, through recent consultation with Government Ministers and Departments, its sector partners and industry stakeholders, refinements to the national model to continue to improve public procurement across government.  The feedback from this stakeholder engagement will help to inform such proposals.  My colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for Public Procurement, and I will engage with our colleagues in Government on them in due course.</p></reply>

The national restoration programme for Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas is contained within this Plan. It was intended to restore all designated raised bogs within 3 cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the Management Plan. </p>  <p>  This programme is being accelerated due to the announcement in Budget 2020 of &euro;5m from the Carbon Tax Fund for peatlands restoration. This funding will allow for restoration measures to be undertaken on approximately 1,800 hectares on up to 9 raised bog designated sites across 7 counties in 2020 and the installation of an Eddy Covariance Flux tower on a representative bog to directly observe the exchanges of gas, energy, and momentum between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. The flux tower will directly measure the carbon, water, and heat flows between plant communities and the atmosphere.</p>  <p>  The restoration measures on Ireland's protected raised bogs are among the peatland actions in the Climate Action Plan 2019 and also support the Just Transition process in the midlands region. </p>  <p>  Unlike with peat extraction, such as on areas of more than 30 hectares, to which the  High Court judgement of September 2019 referred to by the Deputy relates, restoration measures on raised bogs involve the insertion of dams on certain areas of the bog to block surface water drains and restore more natural physical conditions, thus rewetting the bog and raising water levels close to the bog surface to restore peat forming conditions. The aim is to raise the water table so that it remains within 10cm of the surface to encourage the growth of sphagnum moss. Restoration measures may also include tree felling and scrub clearance. </p>  <p>  I am advised that peatland restoration measures being undertaken as part of the Department&rsquo;s 2020 programme are directly connected with and necessary for the management of special area of conservation raised bog sites and as such an appropriate assessment is not required to be undertaken in advance of these measures being undertake on a particular site. Therefore, there is no requirement generally to seek planning permission on this basis. However, prior to the commencement of restoration measures on each protected raised bog site, any necessary environmental screening and assessment will be undertaken. </p>  <p>  Amenity development proposals at these sites may require planning permission and will be progressed as necessary. </p></reply>

In June, the Government made an additional &euro;20 million available to the Arts Council and a further &euro;5 million as part of the July stimulus bringing the 2020 allocation to &euro;105 million. </p><p>I understand that the outdoor arts event referred to by Deputy Gannon is made possible through public funding, sponsorship, donations and fundraising.  The Arts Council operates a number of funding schemes for arts organisations such as that referred to by the Deputy  and details of these may  be viewed on their website's funding page. </p><p>The Arts Council works with the Local Authorities partnership through its strategic partnership which has been in operation for 10 years.  Under this partnership, the Council  provides funding on a competitive basis to support local authorities with ambitious and imaginative proposals to assist artists in developing their practice and their ideas, and/or deliver excellent arts experiences to the public. This includes funding to the local authorities who are in turn fund cultural events similar to that which the second Deputy refers to. Further details of these initiatives with local authorities&rsquo; arts offices can be accessed on the Arts Council's website under &quot;local arts&rdquo; at the following link www.artscouncil.ie/Arts-in-Ireland/Local-arts/.</p><p>Support for the local authorities is also provided under the Creative Ireland Programme which comprises of work co-funded by my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  In the past few weeks, my officials in the Creative Ireland Programme have been working with Programme partners including in the local authorities to develop a series of newly-funded initiatives in relation to positive ageing and creative wellbeing.  </p><p>Operation and licensing of pubs is a matter for the Minister for Justice and school transport is a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills. Deputy O'Sullivan may wish to note that that the Return to Work Safely Protocol published by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation provides detailed guidance developed to assist employers and employees in the coming period and is available at this link</p><p>. </p><p>In line with the revised &lsquo;Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business&rsquo;, pubs that do not serve substantial meals are due to reopen in Phase 4, which is scheduled to commence on 10 August. With reference to live music events the current restrictions of 50 people at indoor gatherings and 200 people at outdoor gatherings have been extended to 10 August.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland has published Guidelines for re-opening tailored to the various sectors of the Irish tourism industry including the reopening of pubs which can be accessed at this link . These guidelines are intended to provide clarity to operators so that they can reopen safely.  The operational guidelines will be regularly updated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in line with Government public health advice as and when this advice evolves.</p></reply>

Major capital projects are appraised, planned, implemented and evaluated in line with the Public Spending Code and best practice guidance outlined in the Capital Works Management Framework published by the Office of Government Procurement. </p><p>The majority of the Department&rsquo;s major capital projects fall within an ambitious programme of redevelopment and renovation of our National Cultural Institutions (NCIs) where considerable progress has been made to date in progressing projects through the appraisal and design/planning stages. From a total investment of &euro;460 million, the National Development Plan set out the following indicative investments for each of the projects included under this element of the Department&rsquo;s investment programme.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Institution</th>       <th>Indicative Investment by Department</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Library of Ireland</td>       <td>&euro;23 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Archives</td>       <td>&euro;22 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Museum of Ireland </td>       <td>&euro;85 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Concert Hall</td>       <td>&euro;78 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Crawford Art Gallery</td>       <td>&euro;22 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Gallery of Ireland</td>       <td>&euro;54 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Abbey Theatre</td>       <td>&euro;80 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Museum of Modern Art</td>       <td>&euro;36 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Chester Beatty Library</td>       <td>&euro;20 million</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>A further &euro;40 million has also been set aside to address essential maintenance and remedial works in these historic buildings over the 10-year implementation period of the investment programme. </p><p>Already this year, my Department has commenced Phase 2 of the redevelopment of National Library of Ireland involving essential external works and investigative works relating to the historic West Wing of the library.  This phase will provide invaluable information which will ensure robust cost estimates for the major redevelopment of the West Wing in subsequent phases.  Similarly, the OPW, which is an important partner in the delivery of the NCI programme, will shortly commence investigative and remedial works at the Natural History Museum, which will again inform the final project budget.  In respect of the National Archives redevelopment, the project has just completed the tender stage and a tender analysis is currently underway.  This will inform the final project budget and construction is expected to commence within the coming months.  This redevelopment will see the Archives&rsquo; capacity increased significantly with the provision of a secure environmentally-controlled archival repository that meets modern archival standards.  All works are contingent on COVID-19 public health restrictions and guidelines currently in place. </p><p>Work is continuing with the other National Cultural Institutions in partnership with the Office of Public Works to progress individual capital projects as they advance through the project life-cycle required by the Public Spending Code. I expect to approve a number of strategic assessments and preliminary business cases over the coming months to enable further appraisal, planning, design and procurement to commence.  In particular, I intend to advance projects at the Crawford Art Gallery, a further phase of the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Concert Hall and the Abbey Theatre.  </p><p>In respect of these major capital projects, the indicative investment set out in Project Ireland 2040 are managed in the context of multi-annual capital allocations available to my Department. However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Government, last week, announced a broad ranging stimulus package which included capital funding of up to &euro;6 million being made available to my Department to accelerate the aforementioned planning, design and procurement phases at a number of these National Cultural Institutions.  This investment under the stimulus package is just one of a number of measures announced by Government to support the Culture and Gaeltacht sectors over the past months.  </p><p>As mentioned previously, these major capital projects are just one element of my Department's investment under Project Ireland 2040 with other crucial investments being delivered through investment programmes, grant schemes and in partnership with agencies under the aegis of the Department.  </p><p>Over the 10-years of the programme, we are investing &euro;265 million in Culture and Creativity which includes a broad range of investments in the development and support for our audiovisual industry through Screen Ireland, in enhancing and future proofing our regional arts and culture infrastructure through a number of grant schemes, as well as supporting important projects like the Beyond 2022 project, which is currently in the process of digitally recreating the 1922 Public Records Office, and the redevelopment of the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin.  </p><p>Under the &euro;285 million Heritage Investment Programme, we support a wide range of important built heritage restoration and maintenance projects across the country under both the Historic Structures Fund and Built Heritage Investment Scheme.  Funding of over &euro;4.3 million was announced to support 449 projects under these schemes last month. In terms of our natural heritage, we are progressing a broad range of projects and programmes which protect our unique landscapes and enhance all our wellbeing through our National Parks and Nature Reserves.  2019 saw a significant programme of trails upgrades across this network which is being continued and expanded to include enhancing our visitor facilities and improving physical distancing measures in 2020.  Additionally, my Department also announced a major &euro;5 million investment in peatlands restoration earlier this year.  </p><p>My Department is also working closely with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to deliver a capital investment programme of &euro;105 million to enhance and support employment opportunities across the Gaeltacht.  This is one element of a total &euro;178 million investment in our language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands which will also see enhancements in marine infrastructure, in particular at Inis O&iacute;rr pier, and in language and cultural hubs throughout the country.  In terms of the latter, the Department is working closely with key partners Conradh na Gaeilge, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Dublin City Council to redevelop 6 Harcourt Street as a flagship language and cultural hub in Dublin City.</p></reply>

In last week&rsquo;s the Stimulus, I announced further increase funding to the Arts Council bringing the 2020 allocation to a total of &euro;105 million. </p><p>I understand that the Arts Council plans to invest the additional resources in enhanced bursaries, commissions, projects and other supports for individual artists and practitioners, and in the arts organisations through which much of the work is made. In this way additional funding for the Arts Council will be targeted at protecting jobs and livelihoods of artists as well as helping arts organisations facing financial difficulties.  Further information and application details are available at . I was pleased to visit the Arts Council today, to mark the announcement of its award of Next Generation bursaries to 23 artists from across the country practicing a wide range of disciplines from music and dance to film, theatre and literature. The bursary is targeted at artists at an early, pivotal point in their careers, allowing them time to develop their practice. </p><p>The Creative Youth Plan under the Creative Ireland Programme commits to increase and enhance access to a range of creative and cultural activities and practices for young people including pilot projects aimed at increasing and enhancing access to drama and group singing activities in partnership with Youth Theatre Ireland and Sing Ireland.</p><p>The July Stimulus also included a  &euro;200 million investment in training and education, skills development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies, job search and assistance measures to help those who have lost their jobs find a new one, retrain, or develop new skills.

In this regard, the Department issued Circular Letter PL 08/2020 on 9 June 2020 requesting the submission of a further progress report on the implementation of the levy by each local authority.</p>  <p>  The Department received a return from each of the 31 local authorities which indicated that as of 1 January 2020 there were 369 sites listed on local authority registers. These sites will be levied at 7% market valuation rate in 2021 unless works commence in the interim or their inclusion on the registers is successfully appealed.</p>  <p>  The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to the amount of the levy that would be raised in 2021 is not available in my Department as it does not have market valuation information for all of the 369 registered sites. </p>  <p>  However, based on the information from the recent progress reports which showed that there were 211 sites with market valuations of &euro;237.3m listed on local authority registers on 1 January 2019 and were liable to the levy in 2020,  it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally for 2021 could be of the order of:</p>  <p>  - &euro;23.7m at a rate of 10%, </p>  <p>  - &euro;29.6m at a rate of 12.5%, </p>  <p>  - &euro;35.59m at a rate of 15% and </p>  <p>  - &euro;41.5m at a rate of 17.5%.</p>  <p>  As indicated, this estimate for 2021 is based on the number of sites that had market valuations attached and were liable to the levy in 2020. The number of registered sites with market valuations attached has since increased; however the information in this regard is not currently available in my Department. The inclusion of these additional sites in respect of which market valuations have since been obtained would result in a higher yield in the estimated levy proceeds nationally for 2021 than that indicated above.</p>  <p>  The levy is not intended to be a revenue generating measure with the proceeds accruing to the relevant local authority rather than the Exchequer. The levy proceeds generated are specifically intended to be used by local authorities for the provision of housing and regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their administration costs in collecting the levy.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP.</p><p>In order for housing assistance to be provided under the Act the housing authority must be satisfied that the tenancy concerned is or would be a tenancy in good faith. Where there is a family relationship between the tenant and the landlord, the housing authority may seek evidence of a previous landlord and tenant relationship between a landlord and the HAP applicant.  This evidence may include:</p><p>- Proof of rent payments;</p><p>- A lease or tenancy agreement for the property; and</p><p>- Registration of the tenancy with the Residential Tenancies Board.</p><p>HAP support is available to tenants in rent a room scheme arrangements, however, the rental of a room to a civil partner, son or daughter is excluded from this scheme.  HAP cannot be paid where the tenant is seeking to rent within the family home. </p><p>In order for a housing authority to be satisfied that a tenancy is or would be in good faith; the onus is on the applicant and landlord to prove that what is being proposed is a bona fide tenancy.  Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the housing authority to make a decision in each individual case. </p></reply>

If upon review, a household is found to exceed the limits on income eligibility grounds, for example, they would be removed from the list.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, authorities are also required, when directed by the Minister, to undertake a statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) to count the number of households on the waiting list for social housing supports whose need has not yet been met. The SSHA process requires all local authorities to review those households who are on their housing list but who are not currently in receipt of housing support. </p>  <p>  As part of this assessment, all local authorities write to relevant households informing them of the assessment process and seeking updated information where necessary. Where a number of attempts to contact a household fail to elicit a response, authorities are advised that it is not unreasonable to then close the household&rsquo;s application. However, local authorities are also advised that should the household subsequently respond with the information required within a reasonable time, the application could be re-activated.</p>  <p>  The SSHA has been conducted on an annual basis since 2016, prior to which it was carried out once every three years, with the last Summary under this approach having taken place in 2013. Complete national data on the number of households removed from housing lists due to not responding to local authorities in 2016-2018 is not available. However, data for 2019 indicated that just over 2,000 households were removed from the list as part of the 2019 process for failure to engage with the local authority by the relevant date. My Department does not have data as to how many were subsequently reinstated due to contact with the local authority after the date of the SSHA count.</p></reply>

The Strategic Funding Plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>The funding plan in turn was developed in the context of the Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025, which my Department published in 2018 following its approval by Government. The Policy Statement gives clear direction to strategic planning and decision making on water and wastewater services in Ireland. The Policy Statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation, and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans. The Policy Statement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>In addition to the above, Irish Water is also regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as the independent economic regulator.  The CRU is responsible for setting the total level of revenue which Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from customers, to cover its efficiently incurred costs.  This CRU process involves, inter alia, reviewing submissions from Irish Water, including on its capital investment plan for the five year period from 2020 to 2024 to support Irish Water&rsquo;s strategic objectives, as set out in the Water Services Strategic Plan (WSSP) and its Strategic Funding Plan, and thereafter setting appropriate revenue allowances for operating costs, capital costs and other items for given regulatory periods.  The actual allowed operational expenditure and capital investment is therefore decided by the CRU as part of the economic regulatory process and the annual budgetary and estimates process in respect of domestic water services. </p><p>The prioritisation and progression of individual projects, including the one referred to in the question, is a matter for determination by Irish Water within this overall funding regime.</p><p>The CRU is due to shortly make its full determination on Irish Water's total capital allowance for the period 2020-24. Exchequer funding is provided to Irish Water for the provision of domestic water services. Irish Water's annual Exchequer funding amount is determined through the estimates and budgetary process, having regard to the forthcoming CRU revenue determination.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p><p>As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of European Union Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p><p>The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are extremely detailed and technical in nature.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, is currently analysing the submissions received. </p><p>Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process.  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  On 6 July my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Circulars in relation to lending issues, in particular, those that relate to certain provisions of the Credit Policy for the RIHL, are not considered appropriate to release.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, I can confirm that in general, persons currently on the TWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS Income. This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan and will enable them to commence the property search. Where such applicants are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until the applicants' unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. There is no blanket ban.</p>  <p>  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.  For applicants whose post-TWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.</p>  <p>  This approach is in line with the need to lend on a prudent basis, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment and it would not be appropriate to lend when there is a risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.  This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens.   </p></reply>

In accordance with section 96(13) of the Act of 2000, these are:</p><p>(a) provision of houses by an approved housing body for social housing and/or affordable housing; </p><p>(b) conversion of an existing building or the reconstruction of a building to create one or more dwellings provided that at least 50% of the external fabric is retained; </p><p>(c) carrying out works to an existing house;</p><p>(d) development of houses pursuant to an agreement under section 96 of the 2000 Act.</p><p>As provided for in section 97 of the 2000 Act, the Part V requirement also does not apply to developments consisting of 9 or fewer houses or a development of houses on land of less than 0.1 hectare where, prior to the application for planning permission, the developer applies for and is granted a certificate to that effect by the planning authority.  Guidance on the provisions of section 97 of the Act is at &lsquo;Section 12 &ndash; Anti-Avoidance Provisions of Part V (Section 97)&rsquo; of the December 2000 &lsquo;Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 Housing Supply Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rsquo;.  </p><p>The Programme for Government contains commitments in relation to the delivery of affordable homes through Part V and I have confirmed that the current 10% requirement for social homes will be protected and that I would like to see the requirement increased to 20% for social and affordable homes.

This allows qualified applicants to 'register an interest' in available homes. </p>  <p>  Applicants can act on their own initiative to respond to adverts and express an interest in dwellings that they would like to live in, rather than waiting for an authority to offer them a dwelling. This approach offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal, and helping to build sustainable tenancies and stable communities.</p>  <p>  The Social Housing Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2016 required all local authorities, if they had not already done so, to provide for CBL as a method of allocation for social housing in their allocation schemes by the end of 2016. The way in which CBL is implemented, including decisions on who has access to the system and which properties are to be offered through it, is a matter for the individual authority concerned. However, it must be done in accordance with the relevant regulations and their own scheme of priority.</p></reply>

Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes.  </p>  <p>  An initial three-month waiver of rates for businesses forced to close business due to COVID-19 was announced in early May.</p>  <p>  In order to enhance the supports available for enterprise, and in recognition of the fact that not only have many ratepayers been forced to close business due to the public health requirements, but many others who remained open have suffered significant reductions in turnover, this waiver has now been extended for a duration of six months to the end of September and the categories of enterprise who will be eligible to avail of it has been expanded. </p>  <p>  The implementation of this waiver is a matter for local authorities and accordingly, the information sought in the question is not available in my Department.</p>  <p>  A 100% waiver will be applied to all businesses, for a six-month period to the end of September, with the exclusion of a small number of categories. The rationale for the exclusion of certain categories of ratepayers is that their operations were not as severely impacted by the pandemic, coupled with the need to direct resources appropriately.</p>  <p>  To support both the local government sector and the ratepayers impacted, &euro;600m has been allocated by Government to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates for six months for eligible businesses impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic. This will take the form of a credit in lieu of rates.</p>  <p>  The Credit in Lieu of Commercial Rates shall be administered by Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  Credits in lieu of commercial rates applied to ratepayer accounts under this scheme shall be applied as a credit on the rate bill for 2020. Local authorities should automatically apply a 100% credit in lieu of commercial rates, for a six-month period, to classes and categories of occupied rateable property where the occupying business is not in an excluded category.</p></reply>

The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect that the review will be published once all the work on these reform measures is completed.</p></reply>

The Council completed a tender process in December 2019, and in March 2020 my Department requested and received the tender report and cost plan, along with further detail in May 2020.

The Code is overseen by an Interim Regulatory Committee supported by a Regulation Office based in the Housing Agency. </p><p>Where the Regulation Office identifies significant issues and risks in relation to an AHB&rsquo;s governance, financial viability and/or performance management, it enters that organisation into a process of Engagement. AHBs usually enter Engagement for a combination of reasons. The most common causes are governance and financial management/viability matters. </p><p>The overall aim of Engagement is to protect AHB assets and to safeguard the interests of tenants, service users and key stakeholders. The Engagement process identifies key changes required by the AHB to bring its performance, governance or financial management to an acceptable level. </p><p>The Regulatory Assessment Cycle typically runs from November to May each year, during which AHBs may be deemed to require Engagement. The table below set out the total number of AHBs in Engagement at each of the requested dates. <table>    <tr>       <th>No. of AHBs   in Engagement at</th>       <th>July 2018</th>       <th>July 2019</th>       <th>July 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AHBs </td>       <td>12 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>26 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The increase in the number of AHBs in Engagement in 2020 is largely attributable to two factors:</p><p>- A number of additional AHBs signed up to Voluntary Regulation Code (VRC) in 2019/20. These AHBs demonstrated significant non-compliance with the Standards.</p><p>- An increased focus on AHBs who have less than 5 directors. This forms part of the eligibility criteria for AHBs in the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Act 2019. </p><p>The length of time an AHB remains in Engagement is largely dependent on the organisation itself. Issues affecting the length of time include the willingness and ability of the organisation to effect change, size of the AHB, structural and/or cultural issues and the scale of the matters to be addressed. The average period for which the Engagement lasted is 17 months. 15 AHBs have successfully exited the engagement process. All organisations presently in Engagement are actively working towards compliance with the standards and exiting Engagement.</p></reply>

Furthermore, Ireland, along with our EU partners and others in the international community, have been vocal about our concerns regarding the treatment of ethnic Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. Ireland was one of 27 States to join a Joint Statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 30 June 2020 which reiterates our concerns, and urges China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It also called on the High Commissioner to provide regular information about the situation in the region, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed under international law. </p>  <p>  Ireland has previously joined a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee in October 2019, and a Joint Letter at the UN Human Rights Council in July 2019, which outlined our concerns in the region. The Joint Statement called for the Chinese Government to urgently implement eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, including by refraining from the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and members of other Muslim communities. The Joint Letter called on the Chinese Government to uphold its international obligations, and to respect human rights in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang was also raised at EU level during the EU-China Summit on 22 June 2020, and during an EU statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 1 July 2020. </p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora as appropriate. </p></reply>

The EU Commission, Parliament, and Council have now all adopted their respective positions on the Conference and will now undertake discussions to agree a unified approach as to its governance and modalities. We look forward to the outcome of these negotiations and the start of the Conference.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a strong record of citizen engagement on Europe, including recently through the Citizens&rsquo; Dialogues on the Future of Europe.

Although progress has been made in certain areas, there continue to be instances of human rights violations. I am aware of the cases raised by the Deputies, and the decision of the Court of Cassation in Bahrain to confirm the death penalty ruling in their cases.</p>  <p>  A moratorium on the death penalty had been in place in Bahrain since 2010 and  the decision to resume the use of capital punishment in 2017 was deeply concerning. The execution of three people in Bahrain in July 2019 was a particularly negative development.</p>  <p>  The abolition of capital punishment is one of Ireland's international priorities and we condemn the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Ireland joins with the EU in calling on Bahrain to halt the execution of theses two individuals. Ireland fully supports the EEAS statement issued on 13 July, which notes that the death penalty &ldquo;is incompatible with human dignity&rdquo;, &ldquo;does not serve as an effective deterrent to crime and makes any miscarriage of justice irreversible&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights feeds into our bilateral dialogue with Bahrain. Senior officials from my Department have raised our concerns about this case directly with the Bahraini Ambassador to Ireland, reiterating our long-standing opposition to the death penalty. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2019, I also raised the human rights situation in Bahrain with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues.</p>  <p>  I note the recent statement made by the Bahraini Ministry of Foreign Affairs that, should countries which still use capital punishment, especially Islamic countries, agree to abolish the death penalty, that Bahrain would seriously consider this issue. I urge Bahrain to consider assuming a position of leadership in this regard. </p>  <p>  At the most recent informal EU-Bahrain Human Rights dialogue in November 2019, issues discussed included the right to a fair trial, prison conditions, and the overall human rights situation in the country. I also understand that the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, has made contact with the Bahraini authorities in relation to these two cases.</p></reply>

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the priority of protecting public health, we have cooperated particularly closely with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Health and the HSE.</p>  <p>  Our system involves four levels of security rating: Normal Precautions; High Degree of Caution; Avoid non-Essential Travel; Do Not Travel. These ratings reflect the Department&rsquo;s estimation of the relative safety and security of a country at a specific point in time. The current advice is against all non-essential travel overseas with the exception of a very limited number of locations.</p>  <p>  The Department's travel advice is not designed to advise whether any individual's trip should be considered essential or non-essential. Instead, it provides an objective assessment of the risks individuals could face if travelling overseas, with a view to helping them to make informed decisions for themselves. </p>  <p>  We must adopt a common sense approach to Essential and non-Essential Travel and be cognisant of the personal circumstances of individuals. Essential travel in my view should be for compelling reasons. These can be related to pressing family, extended family or relationship reasons such as bereavement, serious illness or personal difficulties. There can also be compelling business and work related reasons which make travel essential and critical.</p>  <p>   But we must also realise that it is for every individual, having weighed up the relevant data and personal circumstances, to decide whether the essential nature or urgency of the need to travel outweighs the potential risks.</p>  <p>  Regardless of whether the travel is essential or non-essential all the regulations must be followed on return.</p></reply>

There are concerns in particular about the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists, labour rights activists, artists and environmentalists. Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of our engagement and dialogue with Iran.</p>  <p>  Discriminatory practices with respect to employment, education and access to other basic services, continue to affect Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; and other minority groups in Iran. Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; business owners struggle to start and operate businesses, including issues with forced closures. Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; students face challenges in gaining access to education, with consistent reports of applicants to universities being rejected on the basis of their faith. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran has reported that members of minorities continue to be subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention for engaging in peaceful advocacy for their rights in Iran.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call strongly for the end to the persecution of members of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; faith in Iran, including through bilateral contacts, with our EU partners and at the UN. Bilaterally, our concerns are conveyed to the Iranian Embassy on all appropriate occasions. As part of political consultations with Iran which took place in Tehran in February, senior officials from my Department again directly communicated our concerns regarding the human rights situation in Iran.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also consistently raised the discriminatory treatment of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s in multilateral fora. Most recently, at the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland raised concerns regarding the continued discrimination against members of ethnic and religious minorities, in particular those that are not recognised under the Constitution in Iran, and made specific reference to the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community.</p>  <p>  Ireland also called on Iran to take all necessary steps to protect the rights of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; during the Universal Periodic Review of Iran&rsquo;s human rights record in November 2019.</p>  <p>  Ireland, along with the EU, will continue to encourage progress in relation to religious minorities in Iran, and to make clear our concerns to the Iranian authorities.</p></reply>

The additional time afforded by the transition period has allowed departments to refine this work and re-calibrate it as necessary for the end of the transition period. The end of transition will involve both immediate challenges and long term, permanent changes.</p>  <p>  In any scenario from 1 January 2021, the UK will be outside the EU Single Market and Customs Union.  This will bring significant changes to Ireland&rsquo;s supply chains and trade flows &ndash; creating new checks on trade in both directions and increasing costs and administrative burdens on business. </p>  <p>  Given the limited progress in EU-UK Future Partnership negotiations, on 29 May the Government approved the intensification of readiness and contingency planning across all Departments on the basis of two scenarios: (i) a limited FTA and accompanying fisheries agreement, or, (ii) a hard Brexit (no trade agreement).  While Ireland still supports the closest possible relationship between the EU and UK, prudence dictates that we approach our contingency planning on this basis.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to intensify all its readiness preparations. We have made substantial investments in infrastructure and systems at our ports and airports to prepare for the introduction of checks on controls on EU-UK trade. </p>  <p>  In partnership with other Landbridge countries and the Commission, we recently addressed some SPS related challenges affecting Irish/EU goods transiting the UK back into the EU.  The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Transit Convention is a positive step as it will allow EU goods to transit through the UK without undergoing full customs import and export formalities on entry and exit.  However, the way the Landbridge is used will change at the end of the transition period.  We will work with traders and hauliers to inform them of the steps they need to take.</p>  <p>  In 2019, over 63,000 businesses registered for an EORI number, covering 95.8 % of the volume of exports to the UK in 2019 and 92.7% of imports.  Two weeks ago, the Revenue Commissioners wrote to over 60,000 businesses that traded with the UK since 2019 who not yet registered for EORI. In addition to obtaining an EORI number, Government outreach promote awareness of the need for business to address a range of new administrative, customs, regulatory and SPS issues arising from the UK becoming a third country.</p>  <p>  The Government established a &euro;20 million Brexit fund to help SMEs involved in exporting and importing with the UK and further afield to put in place the staff, software and IT systems to be ready for new customs arrangements from 1 January 2021. Further supports are available to businesses as part of the recovery agenda announced in the July Stimulus to help businesses reopen, create jobs and prepare for the economy of the future.</p>  <p>  The &euro;5 billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve which forms part of the new MFF is very welcome and will help cushion the impact on those Member States and sectors most affected.  Ireland worked hard to secure this  Brexit Adjustment fund in the MFF package.  The special allocation of &euro;120 million for a new PEACE PLUS programme is also welcome. This will continue the work of the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes in a post-Brexit context</p>  <p>  We will continue to work closely with the European Commission on readiness work at a European level.  The Commission is currently updating 102 &lsquo;Readiness Notices&rsquo;, which provide advice for businesses and citizens on a wide range of issues affected by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU acquis. These include, inter alia, Air Transport, Food Law and VAT. Where applicable, the updated notices provide guidance to businesses and citizens on the operation of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland. The question of contingency measures at EU level for a hard Brexit will also be discussed at the appropriate time.</p>  <p>  I will publish an update of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness and Contingency Action Plan in September.  This will outline the work taking place across Government and the steps business and citizens should take to prepare for the end of the transition period.   We will also roll out a new focussed communications programmes for the final phase.</p>  <p>  In response to requests from nine Departments, the Government on 29 May 2020 approved the preparation of a scheme for a new Brexit Omnibus Bill.  I expect to bring this scheme to Government for approval and publication in the coming weeks with a view to bringing it to the Oireachtas in the autumn.</p>  <p>  A key difference between the 2019 Act and 2020 Brexit Bill is that the 2019 Act sought to provide contingency measures to address issues arising in a no deal cliff-edge scenario while the 2020 version will deal with permanent change that will take place at the end of the transition period. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Bill is to provide a legislative underpinning to the wide ranging and complex issues that arise post transition, It will seek to protect citizens and consumers, facilitate the sound functioning of key sectors and ensure our businesses are not disadvantaged.  It will also support aspects of the Common Travel Area and North/South cooperation.</p>  <p>  The Government has always been clear that Brexit will mean change. Whatever the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations, it will not be the status quo and the way we trade with the UK will change.  With less than six months to the end to the transition period, Government will continue to develop and refine our readiness efforts.  It is vital that business and citizens do the same.</p>  <p>  However, regardless of the outcome of the future negotiations partnerships, the Withdrawal Agreement including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland will remain in place.  We will also face into this new phase of our relationship with the UK as a member of the EU27 and the strength and solidarity that brings.</p></reply>

My Department, in Dublin, New York and in relevant Missions, is currently preparing for taking up our seat in January, including by reviewing all items on the Council&rsquo;s agenda and considering the approach we will take.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s work will be centred around three core principles: 1) Building Peace, 2) Strengthening Prevention and 3) Ensuring accountability. </p>  <p>  Under the first principle, Building Peace, Ireland will strive to ensure that peacekeeping is connected to longer-term peace initiatives; that there is coherence and complementarity between regional organisations; and that the peace we seek to foster is inclusive of civil society, women and young people. </p>  <p>  Under the second principle, Strengthening Prevention, Ireland will seek to bolster the full spectrum of the UN&rsquo;s conflict prevention activities, from preventative diplomacy, mediation, non-proliferation and disarmament to cooperation between the UN and regional organisations. It also means addressing the structural drivers of conflict and insecurity, particularly climate change, hunger and inequality.</p>  <p>  The third principle is Ensuring accountability, meaning focusing on the rule of law, in particular international humanitarian law and human rights law. We need to prioritise the protection of civilians in conflict, ensure humanitarian access and fight against impunity.</p>  <p>  The Council has many tools at its disposal to fulfil its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. These include passing new resolutions, using press statements, meetings, dialogues and open debates to draw important attention to situations of conflict and insecurity, and ensuring the effective functioning and strengthening the performance of existing subsidiary bodies, sanctions committees and UN peacekeeping and political missions.  </p>  <p>  The action Ireland takes on the Council will be guided by an overarching commitment to having a positive impact on peace and security challenges today and supporting those worst effected by conflict and insecurity.</p></reply>

Work is underway within this group on developing joint communications for Landbridge users.</p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s has acceded to the Common Transit Convention which will allow EU goods to transit through the UK without undergoing full customs import and export formalities on entry and exit.  While this is a welcome development, it is important to highlight that the way in which traders use the Landbridge will change.  In order to benefit from the work done at EU level, the appropriate administration work including the requirement to have a financial guarantee, must be in place.  The Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s website provides details on issues such as the financial guarantee and registering to become an authorised consignee/consignor.</p>  <p>  I will publish an update of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness and Contingency Action Plan in September.  This will outline the work taking place across Government and the steps business and citizens should take to prepare for the end of the transition period.  This will be supported by the roll out of focused communications programmes, including on the Landbridge.</p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to enhancing direct connections between Ireland and the EU.  The Government has assisted ports and shipping companies keep supply chains operating during COVID-19, leaving the industry better placed to provide sufficient freight and passenger capacity post-Brexit.  In the context of maritime connectivity at the end of the transition period, indications from the sector are that sufficient capacity is available and new direct services continue to come on stream will provide additional capacity.</p></reply>

As Dr. Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Emergencies Programme, has said, &ldquo;Nobody is safe until everybody is safe.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union (EU), the United Nations (UN) and a range of multilateral and international organisations allows us to participate actively in the global health agenda and response to COVID-19, as set out in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals. </p>  <p>  As the UN body with the mandate to advocate for universal healthcare, monitor public health risks, and coordinate responses to health emergencies, the World Health Organization is leading global efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, and mitigate its impact. Its guidance to all countries on the response to the pandemic, its global coordination efforts throughout the crisis, and its assistance to the most vulnerable countries, are crucial. Ireland&rsquo;s funding as a member of the WHO contributes to the evidence, guidance and advice it produces. This directly informs our domestic public health response to the pandemic, along with that of the Europe Centre for Disease Control and the European Union.  Irish funding to the WHO this year has reached &euro;16 million.</p>  <p>  The Global Fund for Aids, TB and Malaria, an international partnership designed to accelerate the end of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria as epidemics, is also a key player in the international response to COVID-19. The Global Fund has supported countries to adapt HIV, TB and malaria programs to continue during the pandemic, as well as purchase protective equipment, diagnostics and medical supplies, and to deploy prevention campaigns.  This year, Ireland has provided &euro;17.5 million to the Global Fund.</p>  <p>  GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, is working actively in the COVID-19 response in maintaining routine immunisation throughout the pandemic. GAVI&rsquo;s work in market shaping, procurement, and equitable distribution of vaccines will be critical in ensuring that the world&rsquo;s poorest and most vulnerable people have access to a COVID-19 vaccine.  Ireland this year pledged to increase its funding to GAVI over the next three years by 20%.</p>  <p>  Working together with other actors including the WHO and CEPI (the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), GAVI and the Global Fund have launched an Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT), a collaborative enterprise between a number of health actors to develop, produce and equitably distribute effective technologies in the COVID-19 global response - including the deployment, once available, of a vaccine against the coronavirus.  A key part of the ACT Accelerator is the COVAX Facility, a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. COVAX is co-led by GAVI, CEPI and WHO, working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers. COVAX aims to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.</p>  <p>  UNESCO, the UN agency with a mandate in science, has reaffirmed the central importance of scientific information to make evidence-based choices to control the current outbreak, mitigate its impacts and prevent any future one. Consequently, UNESCO is currently developing a Recommendation on Open Science, through a global consultation with all relevant stakeholders. </p>  <p>  Ireland recognises that a coherent and system-wide international response to COVID-19 is essential, given the interconnectedness of the current crisis. We will use our voice through our international development programme to advocate for this. In support of these international efforts, Government Departments and agencies here in Ireland (including Science Foundation Ireland, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Health Research Board, the Irish Research Council and others), and the wider research and innovation community, are also working together to ensure a coordinated and meaningful contribution to the global response to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Ireland is working with key international development partners to maximise their respective roles and contribution, and combining their scientific expertise, to combat COVID-19.  At national level the Government has also brought together the research and science community to contribute to the global response.</p></reply>

A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, provides a vision for Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation, including the clear commitment of the Government to direct ODA to reaching the furthest behind first. </p>  <p>  Successive Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) peer reviews have commended Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation for its poverty focus and commitment to Least Developed Countries. The OECD DAC&rsquo;s most recent review of Ireland's aid programme, published in May 2020, notes that Ireland 'walks the talk' in allocating ODA to least developed countries and fragile states, priority partners and sectors.  The OECD finds that this clear focus enables Ireland to exercise leadership and make a visible difference. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a leading development think-tank, has also ranked Ireland as the most effective international donor in directing resources to those in extreme poverty. </p>  <p>  In 2018 the top ten recipient countries of Ireland's bilateral aid included, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Vietnam, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe, receiving in total approx. &euro;176 million.  This illustrates Ireland's continued main focus on Africa and many of the poorest countries in the world.   </p>  <p>  Also in 2018 Ireland provided humanitarian assistance in excess of &euro;185 million to support vulnerable communities in Africa and across the globe.  </p>  <p>  Ireland also works with Irish and International Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and is one of the leading OECD DAC donors in providing support to and through NGOs, with the OECD peer review finding that these relationships are characterised by mutual trust, quality funding, and an open culture for substantive and regular dialogue.  In 2018 provided in excess of &euro;106 million as core support to Non Governmental Organisations.  </p>  <p>  With our continued focus on reaching those who are left furthest behind, and through our development and humanitarian partnerships with multi-lateral and international organisations and NGOs, we will continue to make every effort to improve the lives of people in Africa and across the globe. </p></reply>

Ireland supports a number of important international initiatives to undermine their influence and their impact on populations.</p>  <p>  The EU is one of the main financial contributors to the UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) which supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat Al-Shabaab. The EU has also pledged &euro;50 million in funding to the Multinational Joint Taskforce to improve security in West African territories affected by Boko Haram. More broadly, the EU provides significant development funding in Somalia, and in the countries affected by Boko Haram's terrorist activities.</p>  <p>  The EU Council Conclusions of June 2020, which Ireland fully supports, reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s commitment to tackling terrorism across Africa, particularly in the Sahel and Horn of Africa.  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to EUCAP Somalia including the current Head of Mission. In the Sahel, Ireland also participates in EU missions to help Governments build a stronger, human-rights based, approach to the fight against terrorism and organised crime; 13 Defence Forces personnel participate in EUTM Mali, and Ireland deploys an expert to the Civilian CSDP mission in Niger.  </p>  <p>  Ireland also works bilaterally to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups. The Embassies of Ireland in Nairobi, Addis and Abuja actively monitor the situation on the ground, advise on humanitarian response and guide Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in EU and UN forums. We are members of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), which offers international partners a forum to coordinate support to addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin. </p>  <p>  Ireland places a strong emphasis on tackling the poverty, hunger and exclusion which can contribute to radicalisation. Ireland has provided &euro;27 million in humanitarian funding to the Lake Chad region since 2015 and over &euro;50 million in humanitarian funding Somalia since 2012. With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute throughout 2020, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p></reply>

The Guidelines commit the EU to address the impact of armed conflict on children and fight against impunity for those who are involved in the recruitment of child soldiers.</p>  <p>  In 1999, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1261 on the impact of armed conflict on children.  Since then, the Security Council has established tools to strengthen child protection and to support international standards, including a systematic and comprehensive monitoring and reporting mechanism. </p>  <p>  In December 1996, the UN General Assembly created the mandate of the UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict to advocate for the protection and well-being of children affected by armed conflict and develop best practices to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers. The Secretary-General of the UN also issues an annual report on children and armed conflict which examines both trends and specific country situations, listing all armed groups &ndash; both state and non-state &ndash; that recruit and use children. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to combat the use of child soldiers through our development programme, Irish Aid, with a focus on addressing the socio-economic causes that contribute to this situation, through providing access to education, skills and livelihood opportunities, a priority also reflected in our development policy A Better World.</p></reply>

Our work as part of the EU and within the wider multilateral system, in particular the United Nations, supports our efforts to address gender-based violence.  Given the emphasis in A Better World on reaching the furthest behind first, Ireland works to ensure that our partners give sufficient priority to address gender-based violence in fragile states and conflict-affected contexts. These partnerships enable Ireland to support international and local stakeholder efforts to address gender-based violence including through strengthening the implementation of laws, policies and action plans, the provision of key prevention interventions and ensuring access to life saving response services for survivors of violence.</p>  <p>  At the EU and UN level, the Spotlight Initiative, is a global, multi-year partnership between the EU and the UN to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by 2030. Launched with a funding commitment of &euro;500 million from the EU, the Spotlight Initiative deploys targeted, large-scale investments to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific. </p>  <p>  Ireland provides core funding to key UN agencies working to address violence against women and girls around the world including UN Women, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNHCR and OCHA. Ireland also provides annual funding to the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women that works to support frontline grass roots organisations in over 80 countries that are uniquely placed to meet the most urgent needs of women and girls and their communities in preventing and responding to violence.  </p>  <p>  Our bilateral partnerships, which includes partnerships with Civil Society Organisations, also support efforts to address violence against women and girls, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Our humanitarian efforts also prioritize preventing and responding to violence against women and girls in emergencies and protracted crises where risks of gender-based violence are exacerbated and community and family protections have often broken down.  For example, in 2019, Ireland and the International Rescue Committee announced a new three-year, &euro;4.5 million, strategic partnership, focused on addressing gender-based violence in five acute and underfunded emergency and protracted humanitarian crises. </p>  <p>  The current pandemic has increased the risk of gender-based violence.  Ireland, with others, has used our influence to ensure that the UN Global Humanitarian Response Plan reduces that risk as part of its broader pandemic response.  Ireland co-chaired the donor support of the ICRC to June 2020, with gender a key theme of Ireland's time as co-chair: the ICRC is a key implementing partner in that Global Humanitarian Response.</p>  <p>  In 2019, Ireland also launched Ireland&rsquo;s National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security that includes specific commitments to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s support to address gender-based violence in conflict affected states and fragile affected contexts over the next five years.

I have personally been very engaged in efforts to keep the Israeli-Palestinian conflict high on the international agenda, including the situation in the Gaza Strip, and I have made four working visits to Israel and Palestine, most recently in December 2019. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains ready to support any peace initiative that respects the international parameters for a two-state solution and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, and provides a basis to meet the aspirations of both peoples. </p>  <p>  The Middle East Peace Process is regularly discussed in meetings of EU Foreign Ministers, and was addressed in a Ministerial videoconference meeting on 15 May. In advance of that meeting, I and senior officials in my Department discussed the issue with a large number of EU Member States to encourage a clear and united position, particularly on the matter of annexation. At the meeting there was broad agreement that the EU and its Member States should convey our concerns directly to the new Israeli Government. That outreach is ongoing. I welcome the very clear statements by EU High Representative/Vice President Josep Borrell who has stated that annexation could not pass unchallenged and would inevitably have significant negative consequences for the EU-Israel relationship.</p>  <p>  I myself have also raised these concerns with the current Israeli Government in recent days. My officials continue to convey our views to the Israeli authorities. I have also outlined my serious concerns about possible annexation in discussions with US representatives.</p>  <p>  Ireland has long worked to keep attention on Gaza. In my most recent visit to Gaza in December 2019, I saw for myself the impact of the blockade. Ireland contributes humanitarian assistance to alleviate the worst of this suffering, including through our support for UNRWA, which is a key provider of public services, health and education in Gaza. I have initiated an Irish-funded solar power project in Gaza, which will help improve water quality in the area. More recently, my Department allocated additional funding to support the medical response to COVID 19 in the Gaza Strip.</p>  <p>  However, the roots of the problem in Gaza are political and cannot be solved by funding alone. What is needed is the lifting of the blockade, so that normal life and normal economic activity can resume. Gaza faces other challenges, including oppressive rule by Hamas, but the blockade dominates peoples&rsquo; lives in Gaza to such an extent that it is difficult to address other issues. I have raised the issue of the blockade with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work to keep this issue high on the international agenda and to prioritise the Middle East Peace Process, amongst other issues, as we prepare to take up our seat on the UN Security Council in January 2021. </p></reply>

Once these are agreed, ideally before the end of the year, formal negotiations can begin.   </p>  <p>  The enlargement process itself has been reformed, in order to enhance credibility through a stronger focus on fundamental reforms, facilitate greater political control of the process, and insert more dynamism through organising chapters into thematic clusters. Predictability will be increased by giving more clarity on the positive consequences of reforms, as well as negative consequences for backsliding or stagnation. This revised methodology will increase the stability benefits of participating in the accession process for current and future candidate countries. </p>  <p>  Serbia and Montenegro continue to make progress on their accession path. Montenegro now has all chapters open, and Serbia has 18 out of 35 chapters open. Both must now make a concerted effort to improve on rule of law issues, while Serbia must improve its CFSP alignment and normalise relations with Kosovo. </p>  <p>  On the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, the new EU Special Representative, Miroslav Lajcak, has made significant efforts to bring all stakeholders back to the negotiating table and to ensure that the European interest in maintaining stability in the region is represented. Progress in these talks will be essential for both Serbia and Kosovo to move forwards on their European path. Ireland enjoys very positive relations with both countries and continues to provide personnel who serve with both the KFOR and EULEX missions in Kosovo.</p>  <p>  Twenty-five years on from the Srebrenica genocide and the Dayton Accords, Bosnia and Herzegovina still has much work to do before it can apply for candidate status. Ireland shares the EU position that the prospect of EU membership is a powerful agent for the promotion of reform and stability in the country, and to that end we support the work of the EUSR&rsquo;s Office in Sarajevo. Ireland also continues to support Bosnia and Herzegovina&rsquo;s stability through contributions to the EU peacekeeping force, EUFOR Althea. </p>  <p>  The EU, with Ireland&rsquo;s support, has also made a concerted effort to ensure that the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic do not destabilise the Western Balkans. In April, the Commission announced a financial package worth over three billion Euros to help address immediate health needs as well as assist with the social and economic recovery of the region.</p></reply>

The approach has been to prioritise effective policy and operational measures across the Department to manage Brexit impacts, with additional staff assigned or recruited as required.</p>  <p>  The staffing of key divisions at Headquarters with responsibility for Brexit matters, namely the European Union Division and the Ireland, UK and Americas (IUKA) Division, has been reinforced to cover the challenges arising from the UK exit process.  Significant demand for passports and citizenship via foreign birth registration from applicants in Northern Ireland and in Britain continues and additional staffing is in place in Passport and Consular services to ensure an adequate customer-service response.  Many business units of the Department at headquarters in Dublin continue to be involved in the response to the UK exit, including the Legal Division, the Trade Division and the Policy Planning Unit. Overseas, new posts were established in Embassies in London, Madrid, Berlin, Paris, Rome, The Hague and Warsaw as well as at the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels.   </p>  <p>  The 'Global Ireland 2025' initiative will continue to support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism and underpin economic recovery. The strategy will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend national positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, new Embassies were opened in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Monrovia and Santiago de Chile, and new Consulates General in Vancouver, Mumbai, Cardiff, Los Angeles and Frankfurt. This brings to ninety the number of diplomatic Missions in the network. The expansion will continue and planning for new Embassies in Kyiv, Manila and Rabat is underway. The Programme for Government provides for the opening of a Consulate in the north of England and for further strengthening of the diplomatic and state agency network across the European Union and it's neighbourhood. </p>  <p>  The new diplomatic and consular missions enhance Ireland's international visibility; promote our prosperity by developing high level business, community and political contacts; protect and advance Ireland's interests and values in Europe and beyond.</p>  <p>  These measures to strengthen staffing in the existing Mission network remain under review. The Department will reassign or allocate additional staff resources as necessary to further augment our level of support across Government and the diplomatic network to respond to the challenges of Brexit.</p></reply>

My Department is of course also actively engaged in international forums in SDG implementation particularly through the United Nations system. </p>  <p>  As part of the follow-up and review arrangements, countries deliver national SDG progress reports (or Voluntary National Reviews) to the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF), the main body charged with assessing progress towards the SDGs globally.  Ireland presented its first Voluntary National Review to the HLPF in July 2018: the next Voluntary National Review is due in 2022. In reporting at both HLPF and national levels, Ireland uses the official EU SDG indicator set to assess its SDG progress, while also presenting the national policy measures and frameworks through which Ireland is implementing these SDGs.  At this year&rsquo;s virtual HLPF, my colleague Minister Ryan reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the ambitious targets set in Agenda 2030. </p></reply>

My Department is working together with other Government Departments and State Agencies to support the development of the Ireland House model, as committed to in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Working in a collaborative way under one roof provides an effective platform from which to promote Ireland as a great place to invest, trade with, study and visit. The model enhances Ireland&rsquo;s profile in key markets from a political, economic and cultural perspective and is a key asset in strengthening our bilateral relationships and enabling Ireland&rsquo;s engagement and influence in the world. </p>  <p>  At present there are Ireland Houses operating in 20 locations worldwide.  We are currently in the process of finalising an Ireland House in Mumbai as part of the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Diplomatic Network under the Global Ireland Strategy. Work is underway on the development of a new landmark Ireland House in Tokyo, which will provide a high quality centre for Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in Japan, a key trade and investment partner for Ireland. We are also advancing further opportunities, including in Frankfurt, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.</p></reply>

The IOF was created in 1970 and has 88 Member States (54 Members, 7 Associate Members and 27 )bservers). The Organisation&rsquo;s Charter (to which all Members and Observers must sign up) underlines the IOF&rsquo;s commitment to, inter alia, the promotion of human rights, the rule of law, democracy and minority rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to its Observer Status of the Francophonie and to strengthening its relations with the Francophonie community. Since being granted Observer Status, Ireland has appointed a diplomat, in the Irish Embassy in Paris, to deepen our engagement with the IOF and to develop our relations with States in Francophone West Africa. Ireland's Ambassador to France, is also Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the Francophonie.</p>  <p>  Missions across our network have also been active in participating in local Francophonie groupings. At the UN in New York, Ireland has been appointed to the Bureau of Francophone Ambassadors and Ireland is an active participant in the local group of Francophone Ambassadors.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs is also involved in the organisation of the annual Francophonie Festival in Ireland, which was launched in Iveagh House in February of this year.</p></reply>

Additionally, any application and possible eventual participation as an observer at the Council would require a cross-Government commitment to ensure that Ireland could play an active and effective role.  Following consultations with relevant Departments, a proposal is expected to be submitted for consideration by the Government in the autumn. </p></reply>

The P50 class of vessels in the Naval Service ship flotilla were built in Appledore Shipyard in the UK.  L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n (P51) was commissioned in 1999 and falls into the category of ship requiring a mid life refit programme of works. </p>  <p>  Due to its age profile, much of the auxiliary equipment onboard is coming to the end of its useful life or is becoming obsolete and requires to be replaced in a structured manner.  In this regard the Naval Service have, along with my Department,  commenced a planned programme of works to ensure that the vessel will maintain its operational capabilities and reliabilities.  Works commenced in 2019 on L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n with Phase 1 which involved the dry-docking of the vessel.</p>  <p>  Works have continued and are ongoing despite the onset of Covid 19 which has had an effect on the timely delivery of certain parts and services. Notwithstanding the impact of Covid 19 on the supply chain and the carrying out of certain works as originally scheduled, the civil military team managing the project have adapted to the situation and have made the necessary arrangements to ensure that the project progresses to completion. The expected timeframe for delivery and acceptance of the refitted vessel is now October of this year.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. These details are held at individual school level. The Deputy will note however that the selection process procedures and enrolment policy are the responsibility of the individual school authorities.</p>  <p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parent&rsquo;s choice are respected.</p>  <p>  Under Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 where a board of management make a decision to refuse enrolment, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where the appeal involves an Education and Training Board (ETB) school, the appeal must be made to the local ETB in the first instance. Further information on the Section 29 Appeals process is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/Appeal-against-Permanent-Exclusion-Suspension-or-Refusal-to-Enrol/</p>  <p>  In addition, the Educational Welfare Service (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718815.</p>  <p>  I also wish to advise the Deputy that Kilkenny Carlow Education Training Board has confirmed that places for first year applicants are available in Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osrai and Kilkenny City Vocational School (KCVS).  It is open to the parents /guardians of the children concerned to make direct contact with the schools should they wish to submit an enrolment application to these schools. The schools may be contacted through the following email addresses:  Cathy.Mcsorley@KCVS.ie  and for Colaiste Pobail Osrai, priomhoide@osrai.ie.</p></reply>

Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process. </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.

The student is pursuing a course leading to accreditation on the National Qualifications Framework (e.g. Junior Certificate/Leaving Certificate Applied/FETAC 3) </p>  <p>  2. The student requires one additional year in order to complete their course</p>  <p>  3. Retaining the student in the school for one school year will not prevent a younger pupil being enrolled there</p>  <p>  4. Plans are in place to transition the student to a post-school setting at the end of the additional school year</p>  <p>  Special schools are invited each year to make applications for exemptions from Rule 64(1) in respect of pupils who meet the above criteria. Where the criteria are met, my Department will approve the exemptions.</p>  <p>  The school to which the Deputy refers has engaged in this process with my Department. I can also confirm that an application for exemptions, as referenced above, was made by the school. However, as the criteria were not met, it was not possible to approve the application. The school has been notified of this decision.   </p>  <p>  Some people with a disability, over the age of 18, and who have complex needs, may require specialised support throughout their lives.  Ongoing care and support services within the community, in a post school setting, are provided by voluntary or statutory organisations. Responsibility for such care and support rests with the HSE.  </p>  <p>  Special school staff typically have extensive engagement with parents, HSE multi-disciplinary teams and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which involves planning for the student&rsquo;s future, including options for further education, training, employment or other placement options subject to the student&rsquo;s abilities, including the transition to adult services when they reach the age of 18 years.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that students with complex special educational needs who transfer to adult service settings can continue to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or, in adult settings, which are allocated resources towards educational provision.</p>  <p>  I understand that transition between school and post school settings can be a difficult time for students with special educational needs and their families and more so this year due to the COVID-19 crisis. I am also aware though that transition planning for these students will have been well advanced by their schools prior to the school closures.</p>  <p>  Since schools closed last March, supports have been provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning. In addition to the general guidance, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37.  A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  The legislation was activated for a second time on 29 October 2019 following a report by the NCSE which identified children in South Dublin needing special education school places. Since then, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity amongst schools in the South Dublin area. </p>  <p>  On 21 April 2020 my Department received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p>  <p>  The report identifies the schools who it is considered have potential to provide additional places. These schools were identified following an extensive engagement with schools and their patron bodies and parents in the area.</p>  <p>  Having considered the report, the Minister accepted the opinion of the NCSE and statutory notices were served on 39 schools in the area on 26 June last. All schools have been afforded the opportunity to make representations in respect of the notices served. Both the notices served together with the representations received to date from the school authorities and their Patrons have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I understand that some progress has already been made and the NCSE is working with a number of schools to establish classes for this coming school year.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the NCSE, will continue to work through the next steps in this process.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. </p>  <p>  For the calculated grades system to be operated with integrity, an estimated percentage mark, based on credible, satisfactory evidence, can only be accepted from an appropriate source. This is necessary to ensure fairness to all students.  </p>  <p>  The Calculated Grades Executive Office in my Department developed a comprehensive guide to calculated grades for out-of-school learners &ndash; those students who are studying entirely outside of school &ndash; and contacted each student individually on 25 June to invite them to apply for calculated grades.  The closing date for applications was Thursday 2 July 2020 and applications are now being processed. </p>  <p>  In cases where a student who is attending school, but who is studying one or more subjects outside of school, school principals were asked to make every effort to provide an estimated mark for that subject(s) provided there was sufficient, credible evidence available from an appropriate source.  If the principal was unable to provide an estimated mark for any student they were asked to notify the Calculated Grades Executive Office of my Department. </p>  <p>  As part of its commitment to ensure that a calculated grade is provided to as many students as possible, the CGEO are currently undertaking a review of these reports with the schools involved to ensure that the correct procedures were followed. </p>  <p>  Despite every effort being made by schools and by the Department of Education, to provide calculated grades to as many students as possible, there will be a small number of cases where there is no credible evidence to support a calculated grade in a particular subject. To attempt to give a calculated grade in such cases would be unfair to all other candidates. </p>  <p>  Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so. </p>  <p>  No decisions have been issued by the Calculated Grades Executive Office in respect of any of students studying independently, to date.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to engage with third level stakeholders regarding the Calculated Grades process for students seeking to progress to Higher Education. </p>  <p>  This has resulted in an agreed common approach in relation to students who have not been able to obtain calculated grades in one or more subjects.  Students who have applied for a calculated grade, with a view to satisfying matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements and for whom the Department has been unable to award a Calculated Grade in the subject(s), will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation/basic minimum entry purposes.  The CGEO will notify the Central Applications Office (CAO) of any student who cannot be provided with calculated grades, and of the subjects involved, and the exemption from matriculation/basic minimum entry will be granted automatically by the CAO.  The subject(s) for which exemption is granted will not attract points and the exemption cannot be used to satisfy additional programme requirements over and above the matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements.</p></reply>

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  The school referred to by the Deputy will be advised in due course of the outcome of the staffing appeal.</p></reply>

Circular 11/95 &ldquo;Time in School&rdquo; paragraph 3 states that a typical school day for Junior classes is 4 hours and 40 minutes and Senior classes 5 hours and 40 minutes with appropriate recreation i.e. 30 minutes.   </p>  <p>  Children in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day. This is a concession in the interests of young children and allows for a perceived inability on their part to sustain the work of the full day. The decision to apply this concession rests with the Board of Management. Such decisions should be dictated by the educational interests of the children. </p>  <p>  There is a focus in the documentation on welcoming junior infants to schools and a wide range of resources and support materials have been provided by the Department of Education as well as the Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration to support this group. </p></reply>

In addition, there is no charge for children availing of transport on the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs. </p>  <p>  The average cost of providing transport for a child to a primary or post-primary school is estimated at &euro;1,000 per annum.

The curriculum at primary and post-primary is for all learners, from all backgrounds &ndash; regardless of gender, socio-economic background, race or creed. </p>  <p>  At post primary level, many subjects that students take at both junior and senior cycle are based on learning outcomes. Learning outcomes allow teachers autonomy to work with students in choosing themes that are of interest or relevance to students&rsquo; lives. As some issues become topical in society and prominent in the media, teachers can adjust their plans to reflect this and bring these issues into the classroom. The way these courses are designed means that recent political or social developments, such as concerns the Black Lives Matter movement and the concerns that have been raised over statues of historical figures associated with slavery, can be discussed in the classroom and can be incorporated into the curriculum.</p>  <p>  The current Junior Cycle History curriculum was introduced to schools two years ago. As a learning outcomes based curriculum it  allows flexibility and room for innovative approaches to content to suit the context of a given classroom. There are opportunities to explore aspects of history such as the impact of colonisation, the civil rights movements in the 1960s and to the history of Europe and the wider world. For example, Learning Outcome 3.2: evaluate the impact of conquest and colonisation on people, with particular reference to Portuguese and Spanish exploration. Students should learn about the experiences and stories of people who were conquered or colonised and the effect it had on those people because of Spanish and Portuguese exploration in the seventeenth century. Moreover, it also allows for discussion of other examples of conquest and colonisation, including in Africa. </p>  <p>  In Learning Outcome 3.10 learners have the opportunity to explore the significance of genocide, including the causes, course and consequences of the Holocaust. Here, students will learn about the Holocaust, but they can also have the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the significance of genocide in history. Teachers can facilitate discussion around diversity, prejudice, discrimination and racism and the atrocities that have occurred worldwide throughout History as a result. In Learning Outcome 1.2 students are asked to consider contentious or controversial issues in history from more than one perspective and discuss the historical roots of a contentious or controversial issue or theme in the contemporary world. This offers the potential for rich learning opportunities in topics like the exploitation of African people in the slave trade and what that means in today&rsquo;s context. </p>  <p>  The two Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs) in the junior cycle specification facilitates students to explore topics that are interesting and relevant to their own lives. Students who have family backgrounds or relationships with Africa are free to base their chosen study of CBA 1 &lsquo;The Past in My Place&rsquo; on such themes. Equally, in &lsquo;A Life in Time&rsquo;, students choose a person from the past and explore why that person is historically significant. Many figures relating to the history of slavery or to African history more generally could be selected here. There are also opportunities for such projects to be exhibited or shared with classmates or with the school, so that that there is greater awareness and understanding of the issues discussed. </p>  <p>  At Senior Cycle, the Leaving Certificate history curriculum offers students the opportunity to study aspects of the history of Africa in the unit: &lsquo;European Retreat from Empire and the Aftermath, 1945-1990&rsquo;. This topic explores themes such as the impact of western colonialism in Africa, tensions between indigenous people and colonisers, as well as issues of prejudice, racism and the consequences of colonialism. Another topic in the curriculum called &lsquo;The United States and the World, 1945-1989&rsquo; facilitates students to examine the experience of African American people in American history.  </p>  <p>  As a Department we understand that teachers need to be supported in appropriately dealing with sensitive and important issues such as race/overcoming diversity that may arise within the classroom, in this regard, the Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) History team are planning a number of continuous professional development opportunities for teachers in the school year 2020-21. Work is underway to develop webinars and podcasts that support teachers in exploring diverse human histories with students and to develop resources on issues such as racism and privilege in History.</p>  <p>  A review of the junior cycle curriculum will take place next year and the experiences and suggestions from students, will form a valuable part of this review. Relevant topics such as gender, race and prejudice and how the experiences of students can be integrated into the planning of units of work will form a part of the discussion.</p></reply>

Not to run these checks would run the risk of not being able to tell whether or not the standardisation process was working as intended.</p>  <p>  In the Calculated Grades system, students&rsquo; expected performance in a subject and level, will be combined with information about how students in the school have fared in this subject/level in recent years in line with national performance standards over time. The performance of this year&rsquo;s group of students against their overall performance at Junior Cycle will also be reviewed. The relevant information which will be used to support this process includes:</p>  <p>  - National level for both leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations for 2019 and previous years.</p>  <p>  - School level for both Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations for 2019 and previous years.</p>  <p>  - Candidate level for both Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations for 2019 and previous years.</p>  <p>  - Candidate level for the Junior Cycle results of the 2020 Leaving Certificate cohort of candidates.</p>  <p>  While these datasets do include certain demographic information, this demographic information is not being used as part of the process of generating the calculated grades through the standardisation process.</p>  <p>  However, in order to make sure that the standardisation process is doing what it is supposed to do, there is a separate additional process being carried out called validation.</p>  <p>  Validation is an inherent element of any statistical system, and in the Calculated Grades model the purpose of validation is to ensure that the statistical model is behaving as expected, and is achieving its objectives. As mentioned, the validation process has been part of the design from the beginning.</p>  <p>  The workings of the statistical model will be reviewed and validated in a number of ways. There will be review of the distributions of results for each subject and level. There will also be a review of the demographic characteristics of the outcomes which will include gender and socio-economic status of the school.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this review of the outcomes of the statistical model is to check whether the Calculated Grades model is resulting in any particular group being advantaged or disadvantaged relative to previous years&rsquo; outcomes. It is important to note that this assessment is being made relative to previous years; the validation will check, for example, whether or not disadvantage effects, or gender effects are being exacerbated under the model. This is to ensure that the model is presenting outcomes that are as fair and equitable as possible given its constraints, and in line with previous outcomes as much as is possible.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Calculated Grades system is to arrive at the grade that each student would have achieved if the examinations had taken place as normal. The validation process will check to see if the interactions between these characteristics and the calculated results are similar to the interactions in the historical data between these characteristics and examination results.</p>  <p>  My Department has published a Short Guide to Data Collection National Standardisation and Quality Assurance which provides further details about the workings of the calculated grades model. The Guide is available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate</p>  <p>   This process requires adequate time is progressing. On 16 July, I announced that students will receive their Calculated Grades on 7 September. The recent announcement that the results would issue on this date has been portrayed by some as a &ldquo;delay&rdquo; despite no date having been announced previously. This is the earliest possible release date given the rigorous and robust quality assurance checks required to ensure the process has executed with equity and fairness to all students and to ensure that the 2020 results enjoy the same status as those of previous years. </p></reply>

Accordingly, through the Government's July Stimulus package which has also been announced a programme of immediate investment in upskilling, reskilling and refreshing of skills need to be supported throughout working lives.  This funding for higher and further education and training to address this situation amounts to &euro;100m and will fund over 35,000 additional student places in the current year.</p>  <p>  Since the onset of Covid-19 in March, my Department, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and SOLAS have collaborated with key stakeholders from the sector to identify, quantify and develop options to mitigate the financial impacts of Covid 19 on the sector, including costs associated with the safe commencement of the 2020/21 academic year in line with Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  Additionally my Department recently provided specific guidance to the Further and Higher Education sectors about the return to on-site activity in 2020. The advice, which is not intended to be prescriptive, further acknowledges the varied individual requirements and individual circumstances within institutions. </p>  <p>  The provision of additional financial support will assist the safe commencement of the 2020/21 academic year and in order that the sector can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs and provide assurance and confidence to students and their families as well as to staff and other key stakeholder regarding the capacity and capability of the sector in meeting critical teaching and learning and research objectives. My Department will continue to engage with key stakeholders to underpin the achievement of these objectives.  </p>  <p>  The distribution of the funding and eligibility criteria for student supports will be finalised over the coming days and weeks with key stakeholders.  Additionally my Department will continue to work closely with our agencies and key stakeholders to monitor the recovery of the sector through this pandemic. </p></reply>

This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.</p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications  for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here .</p></reply>

As a consequence, issues relating to the terms and conditions of the staff and teachers in this sector are a matter for their employers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part to the initial Covid-19 response, the Government introduced a number of measures to support businesses. Among these measures is the temporary wages subsidy scheme which has facilitated employers to keep employees on their payroll through the Covid-19 pandemic in order to ensure this link is retained as businesses reopen. As recently announced as part of the July Jobs Stimulus, this measure will be continued until the end of August 2020 when it will be succeeded by a new Employment Wage Support Scheme. This new scheme will operate until April 2021 and will provide employers and new firms in sectors impacted by COVID-19 whose turnover has fallen 30% with a flat-rate subsidy of up to &euro;203 per week per employee, including for seasonal staff and new employees. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) has been established for the English language education sector under the remit of the Labour Court. JLCs provide a wage-setting mechanism that can determine terms and conditions of employment, as well as setting minimum rates of pay for workers in certain sectors. In the sectors represented, the terms and conditions may be given effect in law by means of Employment Regulation Orders made under the Industrial Relations Acts. The JLC for the English language education sector was established by Ministerial Order in February of this year and a chairperson from the Labour Court has been appointed to this Committee. I would encourage bodies representing both employers and employees in this sector to engage with this JLC process and to comprehensively address all aspects of the working conditions and pay of employees in English language schools. </p></reply>

These include the services of Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) and additional resources. </p>  <p>  My Department has put in place a number of measures for DEIS schools since schools closed due to the Covid 19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The &euro;16 million DEIS grant for the 2020/21 school year funding was paid ahead of schedule in May this year to all DEIS schools to help support students who are most at risk of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  In addition, all DEIS schools were offered the opportunity to run a one week summer programme targeted at those pupils most in need of support. The aim of the DEIS primary summer camps is to provide rich educational experiences for young people, which foster a sense of belonging and creativity and confidence in their learning. The programme is funded to target educational and social disadvantage. It seeks to assist pupils who are experiencing social or academic difficulties in language and numeracy and who would benefit from a week-long Summer Camp with a very small teacher-pupil ratio.</p>  <p>  A new programme was developed this year for DEIS post primary schools focusing on encouraging those students deemed most in need to reconnect with school, supporting their physical, social and emotional wellbeing and providing them with the skills they need to engage in a meaningful way with learning in the future.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the DEIS summer programmes will benefit  over 7,000 children and at primary level and over 2,700 young people at post-primary level.</p>  <p>  In taking account of the loss of in-class time at the end of the 2019/2020 school year,  and recognising the potential challenges facing schools at the outset of the new school year, support for teacher wellbeing, leadership, digital technologies and support for socio-economic disadvantaged students will be priority areas of focus for my Department&rsquo;s Support Services.    My Department, through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), continues to prioritise Reading and Maths Recovery and research based accredited programmes for those children in DEIS schools who are performing at or below the 1 percentile in standardised tests in DEIS schools as well as maintaining ongoing support for other schools already participating in the Reading and Maths Recovery programmes.</p>  <p>  Yesterday the Government announced the publication of Reopening Our Schools: The Roadmap for The Full Return to School, along with details of a financial package of over &euro;375 million to support its implementation.</p>  <p>  The roadmap outlines a comprehensive range of measures being provided to support the full reopening of schools in time for the start of the new school year in late August.</p>  <p>  The plan and its accompanying documentation provides schools with guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating the school safely in a Covid-context. It advises on areas across logistics, curriculum, teaching, managing school activities, supporting pupils with additional needs, administration and wellbeing.</p></reply>

Posts equivalent to 0.6 PTR reduction will be allocated based as normal on school enrolments and will be clearly identifiable in the school&rsquo;s staffing schedule. This allocation will support the important work of teaching and learning and provide additional teachers needed to support teacher substitution, management of physical distancing requirements by reallocating class timetables in schools to smaller groups class sizes where necessary. </p></reply>

The purpose of this process is to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education in a way that is fair and equitable to all Leaving Certificate students. </p>  <p>  For the calculated grades system to be operated with integrity, an estimated percentage mark, based on credible, satisfactory evidence, can only be accepted from an appropriate source.  This is necessary to ensure fairness to all students.  </p>  <p>  The Calculated Grades Executive Office in my Department developed a comprehensive guide to calculated grades for out-of-school learners &ndash; those students who are studying entirely outside of school &ndash; and contacted each student individually on 25 June to invite them to apply for calculated grades.  The closing date for applications was Thursday 2 July 2020 and applications are now being processed. </p>  <p>  In cases where a student who is attending school, but who is studying one or more subjects outside of school, school principals were asked to make every effort to provide an estimated mark for that subject(s) provided there was sufficient, credible evidence available from an appropriate source.  If the principal was unable to provide an estimated mark for any student they were asked to notify the Calculated Grades Executive Office of my Department. </p>  <p>  As part of its commitment to ensure that a calculated grade is provided to as many students as possible, the CGEO are currently undertaking a review of these reports with the schools involved to ensure that the correct procedures were followed. </p>  <p>  Despite every effort being made by schools and by the Department of Education, to provide calculated grades to as many students as possible, there will be a small number of cases where there is no credible evidence to support a calculated grade in a particular subject.  To attempt to give a calculated grade in such cases would be unfair to all other candidates.</p>  <p>  Such students will have an opportunity to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations when it is safe to do so. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Calculated Grades Executive Office have received an application in respect of the student named above. </p>  <p>  No decisions have yet been issued by the Calculated Grades Executive Office in respect of any of students studying independently.  However, the issue of decision letters in these cases will commence later this week.  </p>  <p>  My Department has continued to engage with third level stakeholders regarding the Calculated Grades process for students seeking to progress to Higher Education.  This has resulted in an agreed common approach in relation to students who have not been able to obtain calculated grades in one or more subjects.

These issues have been discussed at the ELE Covid-19 Working Group chaired by my Department.</p>  <p>  In compliance with the Government Decision taken in March 2020, all English language education (ELE) providers closed their premises in accordance with public health advice as part of efforts to combat the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>  <p>  Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, English language education providers introduced new ways of providing services to their students including facilitating the provision of online classes.  This reflects a similar approach that has been adopted by providers across the wider education system.  If a student is having issues with the programme on offer or in accessing a provider&rsquo;s services, they can engage with their provider to address these issues.</p>  <p>  It is not within the remit of my Department to pursue providers for refunds arising from fees paid by students.  This is a matter between the student and their provider.  However, as part of the conditions for a provider to have its programmes included on the Interim List for Eligible Programmes (ILEP) and therefore be eligible to recruit International Students, it must have established policies and procedures for the refund of fees to students in addition to a complaints procedure in the event of student complaints.  These should be communicated to the student at time of enrolment.</p>  <p>  If the students have exhausted the internal complaints procedure of the provider in question and are still unhappy about the outcome, they can make a complaint to the Immigration Delivery Service of the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, in the case of a complaint regarding refunds, this can only relate to whether a provider has followed their internal refunds policy.  If the provider&rsquo;s refund policy was followed, there can be no further intervention into a private agreement between a provider and their student.</p></reply>

This will facilitate preparatory works to be completed in schools to facilitate reopening such as refurbishment of toilets and reconfiguration of school spaces.</p><p>The additional per capita funding being provided for pupils in special schools and special classes recognises the additional needs that these pupils have and the additional measures that schools may be required to take to support them.</p><p>Special schools and schools with special classes where there is a teaching principal will receive one release day per week.  Those schools with administrative Deputy Principals will be provided with 16 release days.</p><p>The Department is also supporting the replacement of all absences of SNAs in school settings. </p><p>Enhanced COVID-19 rates are payable in respect of students attending special schools and special classes attached to mainstream schools to assist with the extra costs associated with the cleaning of classrooms with a small number of students, operating specialist provision.</p><p>The COVID-19 capitation grant will also be the mechanism through which additional funding will be provided to cater for costs related to hand hygiene measures and PPE requirements under the COVID-19 Response Plan.  Additional provision for this purpose will be confirmed with the establishment of the drawdown framework of suppliers.</p><p>For the Special Education Transport Service, funding supports will be made available to schools for the provision of masks or visors to School Bus Escorts where required, bearing in mind the SEN needs of the child/children on the service, and where physical distancing cannot be maintained. </p><p>It is also recognised that pupils with SEN will require particular support at the time of transition back to school including supporting their well-being, reducing potential anxiety and planning learning experiences that take account of the effect of school closures on their progress. </p><p>Approximately 15,000 pupils with SEN will have availed of the Department-supported summer provision and all records of progress for these children, whether the programmes were delivered in school or home settings, will be available to their schools to support planning for their needs in the new term. </p><p>Finally it is recognised that some children who have complex medical or special educational needs may not be able to return to school at the end of August because the relevant public health guidelines indicate they are at &ldquo;very high risk&rdquo;.</p><p>These students&rsquo; schools will provide additional supports for these students through designated teachers from within the staffing resources of the school.</p><p>Schools will have discretion to manage and redistribute their teaching support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of their pupils/students, including pupils/students at &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; due to COVID-19.</p><p>During the period of school closures the Department provided schools in the primary and special school sector and at post-primary level with a series of &ldquo;Continuity of Schooling Guidance&rdquo; documents to help education professionals and parents to support children learning in a remote environment.  The events surrounding COVID-19 and the public health restrictions which resulted in the emergency closure of schools to learners has highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in how they can provide for continuity of teaching and learning in the future.</p><p>The continuity of teaching and learning during the emergency period was achieved with significant additional effort from all school staff working remotely to ensure students were supported during this time.  Most schools put in place arrangements to communicate with students and parents demonstrating innovation and resilience by providing flexible local responses.</p><p>The Department is updating its Continuity of Schooling Guidance documents to support schools in responding in an agile way in the event of localised school closure or to continue to support pupils with medical or special educational needs who cannot attend school.</p><p>The return to school package includes enhanced allocations to support children, including children who are blind and visually impaired, to be able to return safely for the forthcoming school year.</p></reply>

The interests of students and their families, as well as the safety of staff in our schools, are at the centre of our work as we consider the various challenges associated with that aim. The re-opening of our schools will be guided by the available public health advice and comprehensive engagement with stakeholders including the school management bodies and staff representatives as well as students and parents. I published the interim public health advice received from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to make it available to all schools. A Plan for the safe re-opening of schools will be brought to Cabinet for approval next week and will then be published. </p><p><b></b>My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate and other relevant experts are developing guidance on how to tailor teaching, learning and assessment to appropriately meet the needs of all students as they re-engage with school. While my objective is for full return to school it will be necessary to include guidance for blended/remote learning to cater for some students who may not be able to return to school immediately. Guidance for schools to provide for continuity of learning in these circumstances will also be available. The approach taken by schools will be dependent on the context of each school.</p><p>My Department and our education partners are committed to addressing the various challenges and to conclude planning for reopening by the end of this month. This will give schools sufficient time to prepare at a local level for their re-opening.

Within the meaning of these Acts, HEIs are autonomous with regard to the management of their academic affairs and retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures in this area.  In relation to fees the student contribution charge covers the cost of elements such as student registration, admissions and examination fees. However, repeat examination fees are charged separately being set by the individual HEI concerned and the Minister does not have a function in this regard. </p></reply>

Since then, significant improvements have taken place in the road and rail network and it is considered that the revised distance criteria is more consistent with the type of distances that students may legitimately be expected to commute to college.</p>  <p>  The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to change the current arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1 million added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.  Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In December 2018 a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This funding continued into 2019 and 2020. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the Covid-19 situation.</p>  <p>   In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

It creates a vision for reform and renewal that can help Ireland recover and thrive and sets out a vision for the transformation of our country over the next five years.

The In This Together campaign draws together the huge range of advice and support that is available for people of all ages. To support the wellbeing and mental health of our Leaving Certificate students at this time, a dedicated page on the InThis Together site contains online advice for Leaving Certificate students.  This webpage includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department. The webpage also includes links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and this Department along with the Department of Health and HSE have ensured the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for those students. The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.   </p>  <p>  Also to support Leaving Certificate students and their parents the Institute of Guidance Counsellors (IGC), the Irish Second Level Students Union and the National Parents Council together with the Department and other key stakeholders have come together and are collaboratively planning a comprehensive Leaving Certificate Helpline for early September, which will be available on the day the Leaving Certificate results and CAO offers are released and a number of other days that same week. Meetings have been taking place with the stakeholders and plans are well underway. In the coming weeks the operational plans will be confirmed and the Department in conjunction with  all the various partners will advertise the Helpline supports and operational times. Unlike previous years, this year schools will be open when the Leaving Certificate results are released, so students will have access to their guidance counsellors and other members of the school&rsquo;s student support team, which should provide students with additional support if they are anxious or have guidance-related questions.</p></reply>

The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each HEI who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. The 2020 allocation to the fund is &euro;9.6m which is expected to support circa 14,000 students.</p>  <p>  It is not anticipated that there will be a need to increase the fund in 2020.

The call to researchers for Costed Extensions from the organisation in question closed on 19 June 2020. </p>  <p>  Requests for Costed Extensions have been considered for awards where the research has been seriously compromised as a result of Covid-19. The organisation considers each request on a case-by-case basis. Where clear evidence of serious compromise has been provided, and where the awardee has demonstrated that the use of the first two extension mechanisms on their own cannot ensure the successful completion of the funded award, the request for a Costed Extension can be considered.</p></reply>

My Department promotes the quality of teaching and learning through the provision of continuing professional development (CPD) and supports for teachers and principals. The professional development needs of serving teachers in recent years have been addressed through the provision of an induction programme for newly-qualified teachers, dedicated support for school leaders, national CPD for curricular and policy reform, and ongoing support for teachers. My Department ensures that a range of high-quality models of CPD is provided to teachers and school leaders through its support services, the national network of Education Centres and appropriate groups, bodies and institutions who are empowered to design, develop and deliver CPD programmes.</p>  <p>  The Department is developing guidance for schools to assist them in their planning for reopening so as to ensure that curricular priorities are delivered, ongoing student progression is supported and that teaching and learning is optimal in a new school environment. </p>  <p>  In taking account of the loss of in-class time at the end of the 2019/2020 school year and recognising the potential challenges facing schools at the outset of the new school year, as they return following the extended period of closures since March 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis support for teacher wellbeing, leadership, digital technologies and support for disadvantaged students will be areas where skilled PDST advisor support is likely to be required.</p>  <p>  PDST supports are developed and delivered by both full time seconded teachers and a signficiant number of part-time associates who are released for short periods from the schools that they teach in.  </p>  <p>  Secondment is the core model for the recruitment of 108 Primary and 71 Post Primary PDST educational personnel which is also supported by associates which are available to the PDST to delivery its programme of work as required.

In so doing, the plans and actions of schools to support pupils must be sustainable in a context in which Covid-19 is still present in the country while also being sufficiently agile and responsive to any changes in health advice that may occur over the coming school year. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the loss of in-class time at the end of the 2019/2020 school year, the potential challenges facing schools at the outset of the new school year, and the workload of principals at this time, it is acknowledged that this is not a suitable time for significant curriculum change, particularly at the start of the new school year.  In order to support schools in the practicalities of re-engaging with students, a number of key decisions have been taken to pause elements of curriculum change as set out below. </p>  <p>  At primary level the consultation period on the new primary curriculum framework is being extended to at least end year with completion expected by end Q2 2021.  The effect of this will push out the timeframe for the Primary Mathematics Curriculum and the curricula for each of the other subject areas.  Support for the Primary Languages Curriculum/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile will restart in early 2021. </p>  <p>  The NCCA will continue to undertake development work in the area of relationships and sexuality education (RSE) and traveller history and culture; and the Department will continue to undertake development work in relation to the Education for Sustainable Development strategy, the Literacy and Numeracy strategy and the STEM education implementation plan.  </p>  <p>  At post primary level this pause includes the following:  </p>  <p>  - Junior Cycle &ndash; Schools were originally required to increase the number of hours of Wellbeing provision at Junior Cycle from 300 to 400 hours from September 2020. They will now be able to defer this until September 2021</p>  <p>  - Senior Cycle &ndash; A number of schools were due to introduce new optional subjects from September 2020, including Leaving Certificate Computer Science, Physical Education, and the Leaving Certificate Foreign Languages of Mandarin Chinese, Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese. These schools will now be provided with the option to defer implementation until September 2021. Implementation in schools of the revised specification for Leaving Certificate Art will be deferred by one year to September 2021. The implementation of a number of new Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) Module Descriptors will be deferred by one year to September 2021.</p>  <p>  - Also at Senior Cycle planned consultation on new specifications for Leaving Certificate Irish is being deferred from the second half of 2020 to the first half of 2021. Consultation on a number of other Leaving Certificate subjects will also be deferred, including Physics, Chemistry and Biology, Arabic, and Latin and Ancient Greek.</p>  <p>  - Work on the NCCA&rsquo;s review of Senior Cycle has continued throughout 2020 and it is envisaged that Council&rsquo;s Advisory Report to the Department will be finalised around the end of the year.</p>  <p>  My Department published curriculum guidance this week at both primary and post primary level.  This guidance is designed to support school leaders and teachers in preparing for the re-opening of schools in August/September, in mediating the curriculum during 2020/21, and for those at post primary level, to support schools in the preparation of students for the State examinations in June 2021. In this regard, guidance has also been issued to support schools in running Transition Year programmes and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. </p>  <p>  In this guidance at primary level my Department recognises that it will be necessary for schools to prioritise certain aspects of the curriculum when the new term begins. Schools will need to re-orientate their work with the curriculum especially during the initial weeks of the first term as they give greater time and attention to areas such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), Physical Education (PE), Language and Mathematics.  Gradually, as schools build comprehensive pictures of where pupils are in their learning, they will work towards more &lsquo;typical&rsquo; curriculum plans.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, this guidance highlights that one of the priorities for all schools in the coming school year will be to provide rich and progressive teaching and learning experiences for all students and, in so doing, to ensure that those learners most impacted by the school closure period are enabled to reconnect with and progress in their learning. Teachers should focus on enabling students to learn again, on developing their learning readiness, and on promoting student confidence in and motivation for learning.</p>  <p>  Progressing students&rsquo; learning is at the heart of the decisions that are made by school leaders and teachers in managing the curriculum.  In the context of the return to school, supporting students&rsquo; wellbeing and helping them develop as confident and engaged learners are key objectives. These objectives can be achieved through purposeful forward planning that adapts to the challenges already experienced by schools and those that may emerge in the course of the next school year.</p>  <p>  The guidance documents, which were developed by my Department, working closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Professional Development Services and in relation to the Post-Primary the State Examinations Commission, contain more detail on all of these alterations, can be found on the Department&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>

Not to run these checks would run the risk of not being able to tell whether or not the standardisation process was working as intended.</p>  <p>  In the calculated grades system, students&rsquo; expected performance in a subject and level, will be combined with information about how students in the school have fared in this subject/level in recent years in line with national performance standards over time. The performance of this year&rsquo;s group of students against their overall performance at Junior Cycle will also be reviewed. The relevant information which will be used to support this process includes:</p>  <p>  - National level for both leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations for 2019 and previous years.</p>  <p>  - School level for both Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations for 2019 and previous years.</p>  <p>  - Candidate level for both Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations for 2019 and previous years.</p>  <p>  - Candidate level for the Junior Cycle results of the 2020 Leaving Certificate cohort of candidates.</p>  <p>  While these datasets do include certain demographic information, this demographic information is not being used as part of the process of generating the calculated grades through the standardisation process.</p>  <p>  However, in order to make sure that the standardisation process is doing what it is supposed to do, there is a separate additional process being carried out called validation.</p>  <p>  Validation is an inherent element of any statistical system, and in the calculated grades model the purpose of validation is to ensure that the statistical model is behaving as expected, and is achieving its objectives. As mentioned, the validation process has been part of the design from the beginning.</p>  <p>  The workings of the statistical model will be reviewed and validated in a number of ways. There will be review of the distributions of results for each subject and level. There will also be a review of the demographic characteristics of the outcomes which will include gender and socio-economic status of the school.</p>  <p>  The purpose of this review of the outcomes of the statistical model is to check whether the calculated grades model is resulting in any particular group being advantaged or disadvantaged relative to previous years&rsquo; outcomes. It is important to note that this assessment is being made relative to previous years; the validation will check, for example, whether or not disadvantage effects, or gender effects are being exacerbated under the model. This is to ensure that the model is presenting outcomes that are as fair and equitable as possible given its constraints, and in line with previous outcomes as much as is possible.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the calculated grades system is to arrive at the grade that each student would have achieved if the examinations had taken place as normal. The validation process will check to see if the interactions between these characteristics and the calculated results are similar to the interactions in the historical data between these characteristics and examination results.</p></reply>

All newly qualified teachers (NQTs) of modern foreign languages and Gaeilge are required to meet a residency requirement in order to register with the Council.  Generally this residency constitutes a period of time in a country where the language is spoken or the Gaeltacht in the case of the Irish language. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council have informed me that this year in recognition that travel is not currently possible, they have put in place a provision to allow graduate teachers of languages including Gaeilge, to register with the Council in instances where they are not able to fully meet the residency requirement.  This provision takes the form of a reduction in the overall duration of the residency. In addition should a graduate teacher still not be able to meet this reduced period, registration with conditions will be offered.  This will allow graduate teachers of languages including Gaeilge to register and if necessary fulfil the residency at a date in the future.  </p></reply>

These posts will bring guidance provision in schools back to the level last seen before the financial crisis in 2012.</p>  <p>  The wellbeing and mental health of our school communities is a fundamental element of the Department&rsquo;s overall plan to ensure a successful return to school as we continue to manage the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is crucial that we support the wellbeing of our students and school management and staff in order to support successful re-engagement with teaching and learning.  </p>  <p>  Guidance will issue to schools on logistical, curricular arrangements and wellbeing supports to be put in place to facilitate the phased re-opening of schools. All decisions taken in relation to re-opening schools are based on public health advice. </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities on the return to school requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  This requires a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response will be aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  My Department will work in partnership with the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that the wellbeing needs of all members of the school community are met.</p>  <p>  Schools can utilise their existing school structures, such as the Student Support Team and internal referral pathways, to identify students who remain more vulnerable and then seek to provide these students with additional support, internally or externally by referral on to the HSE or other appropriate support services. </p>  <p>  The guidance counsellor is not expected to be able to provide individual support to every vulnerable student in their school. More than ever the Continuum of Support Model should be applied in schools, so students most in need of additional targeted support are identified and resources, such as guidance counselling, are directed and distributed appropriately. This should be done in consultation with school management and the Student Support Team.</p>  <p>  The National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE) an agency of the Department, is planning to run a comprehensive series of regular online Continuing Professional Development training sessions and webinars for school Guidance Counsellors from August to Christmas, including webinars covering topics such as: adjusting the Guidance Plan, further skills training for online guidance counselling, Junior Cycle Guidance lesson planning, decision making, wellbeing issues and in particular how guidance counsellors can manage their own self-care.</p>  <p>  Guidance Counselling Supervision scheme is continuing as a support to guidance counsellors in schools. Guidance counsellors are provided with 5 two-hour sessions of support each academic year. During school closures this support was provided online or by phone.[note: this is where the guidance counsellors meet as a group with a qualified counselling supervisor to discuss the impact of their work on themselves as professionals and to reflect on their casework in a confidential setting]</p>  <p>  Psychologists from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) will be available to support schools and guidance counsellors as they manage the return to schooling. </p>  <p>  The Employee Assistance Scheme &ldquo;Spectrum Life&rdquo; including an Employee Assistance and Wellbeing Programme is available to all teachers and guidance counsellors who may need additional support if they experience pressure at work.  In addition, the HSE has online programmes available on Wellbeing and on Stress Control to further support Teachers and Guidance Counsellors as they return to school. </p></reply>

As set out in the Return to School guidance published by my Department, as the new school year gets underway, movement and activity through timetabled PE lessons, along with activity throughout the day, will contribute positively to pupils&rsquo; wellbeing; and as such PE should form a significant component of timetabled programmes upon returning to school. The use of &lsquo;pods&rsquo;, the need for physical distancing, the cleaning and organisation of equipment, and the individual school environment will shape the PE learning experiences in the new school year. </p>  <p>  Opportunities for both indoor and outdoor activity should be exploited during break-times, transitions, play, PE lessons, and across curricular areas. Useful resources to support this include Move Well Move Often (PDST) and the Active School Flag resources. During PE lessons, teachers are encouraged continue to ensure all learners engage in aerobic activities as well as skills development, with an emphasis on fundamental movement skills.</p>  <p>  With regards to school sports teams and school involvement in sporting competitions, the decisions taken to become involved in organised school sports should be made at school level and be informed by the most up to date public health advice provided by the National Public Health Emergency Team.</p></reply>

A key part of the strategy is not only increasing the numbers of children taking up a foreign language, but also diversifying the range of languages available to schools and increasing students depth of knowledge in a language.  Exposing children to a foreign language from an early age, would enhance their interpersonal communication skills, adaptability, logical thinking and creativity.  These transferable skills are relevant across all disciplines and subjects.</p>  <p>  Under the strategy, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) was asked to consider including foreign languages in senior classes as part of its review of the primary curriculum. The NCCA subsequently published a background paper &lsquo;Integrating Modern Foreign Languages in a Redeveloped Primary Curriculum&rsquo; available on its website as part of the research base to inform the development of the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework.   </p>  <p>  The draft Primary Curriculum Framework was published for consultation in February 2020 and sets out the proposed purpose, structure and content of the curriculum which will be developed in the coming years.  The draft framework proposes a revised structure for curriculum areas that supports the introduction of modern foreign languages in stages 3 and 4, i.e. from 3rd class onwards, incrementally building on children&rsquo;s existing knowledge and awareness of language and progressing to a competency model in stage 4.  The consultation on the draft framework will continue to the end of December 2020 and potentially into 2021 depending on the Covid-19 situation, with the finalisation of the framework expected by the Summer 2021.  The development of curriculum specifications will take place in the following years.  </p>  <p>  This proposal connects with and builds on the role of linguistic diversity in the Primary Language Curriculum/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile which seeks to support children on their language-learning journeys, in both English and Irish, while also acknowledging the diversity of languages spoken in Irish primary schools.  </p></reply>

The issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal.  </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department held a series of meetings with CE supervisor representatives to consider a number of proposals, mindful of the operating environment in which any potential solution will need to exist.  Related discussions were also undertaken between Department officials and their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). </p>  <p>  Just to clarify for the Deputy, there is no report due to be published by my Department in respect of the CE supervisor pension dispute.  My Department will however continue to engage with all parties to the discussions with a view to establishing a viable solution to this issue.</p></reply>

CIB delivers on this remit through its provision of some services directly to the public and through a network of service delivery companies.</p>  <p>  In February 2017, following lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders, CIB made the decision to restructure the governance arrangements of the network of 42 Citizens Information Services (CIS&rsquo;s) and 51 Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) into 16 regional companies (8 Regional CIS and 8 Regional MABS). </p>  <p>  As part of the restructuring process, 16 new regional companies were set up (8 CIS and 8 MABS). New boards of directors were appointed. All staff, assets and liabilities of the 93 local companies transferred to the 16 new regional companies. The restructuring process was completed in October 2018 and the new companies have been operating effectively since then. There have been no job losses, no closure of service delivery points and no diminution in services provided to clients. </p>  <p>  The aim of the restructuring was to enhance the service for users by improving the governance arrangements for CIB&rsquo;s funded services and unlock the benefits of a more modern and streamlined citizen-focused service delivery model.</p>  <p>  New service - level agreements are in place for all the new companies, in line with good governance requirements. It has also been possible to gain efficiencies in the provision of support services for both CIS and MABS companies with a number of shared services now in place, including payroll services, legal and financial advice on pensions, and a single insurance scheme. </p>  <p>  At the service delivery level, the regional companies now have more flexibility in allocating staff resources to areas of need, and specialist skills are more easily shared. Administrative resources freed up from previous work associated with supporting 93 local companies are now focused directly on clients&rsquo; requirements. In MABS, more regular case reviews are being undertaken and there is increased focus on quality assurance and on achieving improved outcomes for clients.</p>  <p>  CIB continues to support the regional companies and works with them as they respond  in an efficient, effective and flexible manner to the needs of clients. This is evident in the response  by the regional services during the Covid -19  pandemic when both the CIS and MABS regional networks were able to respond quickly and efficiently to share resources and develop new and innovative ways to serve clients , including a new call back service, instant messaging service and increased use of social media to meet their clients' needs.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A decision to extend the period of maternity leave for employees would have to be implemented by the Minister for Justice and Equality who has policy and legal responsibility for this area. An extension of this leave would require careful consideration and consultation. Engagement with employer representative groups and trade unions would have to take place to assess its impact at a time when businesses are facing serious challenges. </p>  <p>  In 2020 it is estimated that my Department will spend in excess of &euro;270 million on maternity benefit in respect of an average of 21,000 recipients per week. Increasing the benefit to 52 weeks would double the costs of the existing scheme and would require a maternity benefit provision of &euro;540 million. This estimate is based on the cost for a full year and assumes that any increase in duration is implemented from the beginning of the year. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there would be additional costs to the Exchequer as these estimates do not include the costs for substitution or salary top-ups which would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Decisions around the extension of this benefit would have to be considered in a budgetary context and the impact it would have on employers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2021, were the scheme to be reintroduced, would be in the region of 32,500, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  Accordingly, if there were 32,500 such grants made in 2021, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be approx. &euro;27.625 million.  Any decision to reinstate the scheme would have to be considered in the wider budgetary context and in the light of available resources. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the previous bereavement grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Allowance scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  This is a more targeted and efficient manner of assisting people with bereavement expenses.  In 2019 over 2,900 ENPs were paid at a cost of &euro;5.8 million towards funeral and burial expenses. </p>  <p>  The Department is providing funding of up to &euro;60,000 in Budget 2020 to support the Irish Hospice Foundation who are carrying out research into the economics of bereavement and awaits the outcome of their research and findings in this area. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As part of the July stimulus package the Government announced the further extension of the pandemic unemployment payment to April 2021. </p>  <p>  One of the conditions for receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment is that a person must have been in employment immediately before 13th March and lost their income from employment. If this is not the case then the pandemic unemployment payment is not payable.  It would be impossible to construct a scheme based on claims of potential or prospective but unrealised employment, particularly where the economy was operating at full-employment with many unfilled vacancies prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  People who do not qualify for the pandemic unemployment payment are eligible to apply for a jobseekers payment.  Jobseeker's benefit is a weekly payment to people who have lost their employment and who satisfy the scheme's statutory conditions including the requirement to have sufficient social insurance contributions paid.  This benefit is paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people who have less than 260 paid.  Where a person does not re-qualify or has used up their entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit they can apply for the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. The maximum weekly rate of payment for these schemes is &euro;203 and increases may also be paid for any qualifying adults and children.  </p>  <p>  Any person who is experiencing financial hardship may be eligible for other financial supports under the means-tested supplementary welfare allowance scheme including an Exceptional or Urgent Needs payment.  Information on the supports available under this scheme is available at www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Government has set employment recovery as its top priority and a key element of the July Stimulus Package will be enhancing the supports available to people who lost their employment to assist people back into work.  My Department has also secured an additional &euro;100 million in funding, in addition to the &euro;12 million already secured in June, for a significant ramping up in the delivery of employment services to workers.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position at this time.</p></reply>

This funding was further extended to allow schools who choose to continue to provide food during the summer period until the start of the new academic year 2020/2021. The extension of the school meals programme over the summer months will be provided for within the budget of &euro;61.6 million for 2020. </p>  <p>  Based on the 2020 budgetary allocation of &euro;61.6 million, the additional annual costs of expanding the school meals programme by 5%, 10%, 20% and 25% are &euro;3.1 million, &euro;6.2 million, &euro;12.3 million and &euro;15.4 million, respectively.</p>  <p>  The School Meals Scheme can provide funding for breakfast or snack, lunch and afterschool, subject to submission of an application.  The scheme is currently available to all 891 DEIS schools, where 162 are not availing of the breakfast or snack. If these schools submitted an application for breakfast, it would cost &euro;2.8m.</p>  <p>  Changes to increase the funding of any scheme administered by my Department would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

While I fully understand that these are difficult and distressing times for many people, especially for the vulnerable and the elderly, any further economic measures can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Pandemic Unemployment Payment is now linked to prior earnings to ensure that it continues to be a strong support but is fair and targeted. </p>  <p>  Where a person is self-employed their gross average weekly income for 2018, the last tax year for which verifiable data on self-employed income is available, is used to calculate the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment.   Combining employee and self-employed income could potentially reduce average weekly earnings in the case of employee earnings, particularly where an employee has relatively small amounts of self-employment income, as the respective earnings would then be assessed over a full year. The nature of self-employment is such that it is not possible, for Revenue and PRSI purposes, to attribute self-employment income to any particular week, and earnings are assessed on a full-year basis. </p>  <p>  Any person who feels that the assessment of their earnings, based on returns already submitted to Revenue, is inaccurate can ask for a review of their case with further details available on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Where an individual&rsquo;s rate is reduced to the flat rate &euro;203 per week and their family circumstances are that they have adult or child dependents, it may be more financially beneficial to apply for a jobseekers payment. The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the self-employed schemes provide a social insurance contribution-based support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment. If a person does not meet the qualifying conditions of the scheme they may be eligible to apply for the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  The maximum weekly rate of payment for these schemes is &euro;203 and increases may also be paid for any qualifying adults and children.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

People aged 66 years and over are provided for within the Social Protection income support framework through the State Pension, either the contributory State pension based on PRSI contributions or the non-contributory means tested pension.</p>  <p>  A person in receipt of the State contributory pension can retain all of their State pension as well as their employment income and retain that pension payment if they lose employment income, thus guaranteeing an income support.  If a person is not in receipt of the maximum rate of State Pension Contributory, they may be eligible for an increased weekly rate of payment on the State non-contributory means tested pension, depending on their circumstances.  A person may also be entitled to an increase in respect of a qualified adult, subject to the means of the qualified adult. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of the non-contributory or means-tested pension who are also in receipt of an employment income may have their pension payment increased if they lose that employment income or it is reduced.  Similarly, if a person aged 66 or over who did not previously qualify for or make an application for a means-tested pension may qualify for a pension payment if their circumstances change &ndash; including if they lose any employment income or if that employment income is reduced.  A person may be entitled to claim for an increase in respect of a qualified adult up to age 66 years depending on the specific circumstances.  </p>  <p>  People aged 66 and over may also be entitled to a range of ancillary supports that are aligned to the particular circumstances of older people and are significantly more valuable than those generally available to people of working age. These include free travel, fuel allowance, household benefits package (gas/electricity) and living alone allowance. </p>  <p>  It should be noted also that employers may claim the temporary wage subsidy, for all of their workers who pay Irish PAYE income tax, from the Revenue Commissioners.  In this way workers who are aged over 66 can continue, with the co-operation of their employers, to receive income from employment. </p>  <p>  A person of any age who is experiencing financial hardship may access assistance under the means tested supplementary welfare allowance scheme including Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment of the person concerned is under examination as part of this process.  I am advised that, that on an initial examination of this case, Department records currently show no earnings in either 2019 or 2020 for the person concerned.  As this produces a weekly earnings figure of below &euro;200 per week, the lower weekly rate of &euro;203 is the maximum possible rate currently applicable in the circumstances. </p><p>A formal reply will issue to the person concerned when a final review of the case has been completed. </p><p>If a customer believes that the earnings information held by the Department is inaccurate, or wishes to provide further details of recent employment or self-employment income, the relevant documentation should be supplied to the Department. </p><p>If, pending the completion of a review of her entitlements, the person concerned is experiencing financial difficulties at the moment, she may wish contact her local Community Welfare office to make a claim for a means tested supplementary welfare allowance.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

To be eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment a person must have been in employment immediately prior to the 13th March and lost their income from employment due to the onset of the pandemic. Self- employed people must have suffered a collapse in their trading income to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time work. </p>  <p>  Where a person is self-employed their gross average weekly income for 2018, the last tax year for which verifiable data on self-employed income is available, is used to calculate the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment. Any person who feels that the assessment of their earnings, based on returns already submitted to Revenue, is inaccurate can ask for a review of their case with further details available on www.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  As part of the Governments July stimulus announced last week, changes were introduced to the structure of the pandemic unemployment payment which mean that it continues to be a strong support but is also fair and targeted. From the 17 September 2020 until the 31 January 2021 the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be paid at 3 rates. The payment rate will depend on the amount previously earned. For people who earned less than &euro;200 per week the rate of the pandemic unemployment payment will be &euro;203 per week. For people who earned &euro;200 to &euro;300 per week, the rate of payment will be &euro;250 per week. For people who earned over &euro;300 per week, the rate of payment will be &euro;300 per week</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

This national allocation has been made from the rural development element of the traditional MFF budgetary framework. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the specific COVID-19 Recovery Instrument, the Next Generation EU fund, a further allocation of funding to support the sector is expected to provide a significant allocation of &euro;194 million to Irish Agriculture under this instrument.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s position has always been that a strong and properly funded CAP is a fundamental requirement if we are to continue to support the sector. I therefore welcome this agreement which represents a positive outcome for Ireland.</p></reply>

We are seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in terms of both access and the quota share it currently enjoys in UK waters. From the outset of the negotiations, Ireland and our EU partners have been clear on our level of ambition in this area and on the fact that progress on an overall trade deal is linked to progress on fisheries. This is reflected in the EU mandate and the draft EU legal text. This government fully supports the proposal to maintain the current access and quota shares going forward.</p>  <p>  The EU position was the result of considerable internal discussion and reflects a delicate balance. In sum, we are seeking to uphold continued levels of reciprocal access and stable quotas. The UK Government has a very different approach. They emphasise their status as a &ldquo;coastal independent state&rdquo; and insist that new arrangements should be based on annual negotiations, which follow the principle of zonal attachment. Clearly, the two sides are still very far apart. This is very concerning to us &ndash; as is reflected in the EU mandate, one of our key priorities is to avoid economic dislocation for Union fishermen that have operated in UK waters. This remains our collective approach. The Task Force is continuing to push for better UK engagement on this area. </p>  <p>  Since taking office, I have met with the Fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius by video link. I made clear to the Commissioner that we are placing our full reliance on Mr Barnier and the Commissioner delivering on the agreed EU negotiation mandate that sets down clearly the EU objective to &ldquo;uphold existing reciprocal access conditions, quota shares and traditional activity of the Union fleet. </p>  <p>  I have also met with representatives of the Irish fishing industry on 22 July where I listened carefully to the clearly-articulated challenges facing the fishing industry in the context of Brexit.    I made clear that I will be pressing for a fisheries agreement with the UK that upholds both existing quota shares and existing reciprocal access to UK waters. I will continue to press for the maintenance of the linkage of fisheries to the overall economic partnership agreement as this will be central to a successful agreement.   I assured the industry representatives of my commitment and that of the Government to work towards a fisheries agreement with the UK that protects their interests and ensures a long term future for our coastal communities dependant on fisheries</p>  <p>  Michel Barnier met in late May with Fisheries Ministers from Member States directly impacted by the UK withdrawal from the EU.  There was clear consensus from Ministers, including from Ireland, on continued support for the EU mandate&rsquo;s position on fisheries. The Government fully supports Mr Barnier in his role and we remain confident that Irish and EU fisheries interests will continue to be protected after the transition period has ended.  </p></reply>

The Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 further protects their welfare and empowers officers of BnG to inspect premises where greyhounds are kept. A confidential phone line and email has been set up for the public to report any alleged welfare breaches. </p>  <p>  The Greyhound Racing Act 2019 strengthens the current sanctioning regime and addresses doping and integrity. This Act also makes provision for a traceability system, which is being prioritised by BnG, and will enable lifetime tracing for every racing greyhound.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with animal welfare charities.  I welcome the initiative of the Dogs Trust in facilitating the International Greyhound Forum, which includes the ISPCA and BnG. </p>  <p>  With regard to the exportation of greyhounds, the rules covering the movement of all breeds of dogs, including greyhounds, between EU Member States is currently set at a European level.</p>  <p>  BnG has informed me that it continues to advise owners to only export to destinations that provide the expected levels of greyhound welfare in its Code of Practice in the Care and Welfare of the Greyhound, a view which I fully endorse. I have received assurances from BnG that it is committed to the expansion of the Code of Practice to include advice on best practice when exporting greyhounds. In addition, the International Greyhound Forum continues to give consideration to issues relating to the export of greyhounds.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Plan of Bord na gCon for the period 2018-2022 has as welfare as a key priority.  BnG have detailed significant progress made in implementing an extensive Care &amp;amp; Welfare Programme in the last 12 months, for example; the opening of BnG's first Care Centre in early July 2020, introduction of an Injury Support Scheme to provide financial support where a greyhound is injured at a racing event, introduction of financial incentives for domestic re-homings of racing greyhounds and a partnership with Greyhound Pets of America which led to number of US re-homings in 2019.</p>  <p>  BnG introduced a Care Fund with effect from September 2019 whereby 10% of all admissions. 10% of restaurant packages, 5% of tote profits and 50% of all sponsorships are directly attributed to the Care Fund. </p>  <p>  My Department met with the Board of BnG numerous times since June 2019 and has received assurances that the Board remains committed to the protection of the integrity of the greyhound industry and to promoting the welfare of greyhounds and that all necessary resources are being committed to these ends.</p></reply>

The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.  All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. </p>  <p>  The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised and, for the next 6 weeks, the focus will be on felling licences.  </p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.</p>  <p>  The Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) is operationally independent of my Department. Additional resources have been assigned to the FAC over past months, including additional administrative resources and personnel with planning expertise, to assist with administering appeals.  Resource needs will continue to be monitored.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government gives a commitment to implement the recommendations of the Mackinnon Review and to review the forestry appeals process. I am committed to aligning the forestry licensing and appeals processes with that of the national planning and other comparable appeals processes.  I am considering how best this may be achieved and expect to be making further announcements in this regard in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Delays in issuing licence approvals for felling in recent months  has resulted in some reduced sawmilling activity. However, the extent to which this specific issue is impacting on domestic house construction in the short term is unclear when significant lockdowns were in place due to COVID 19.  In terms of supply, Irish timber is sold on both the Irish and UK markets. Disruption to supplies of logs from forests has the potential to reduce the amount of timber exported to the UK market, with Irish markets taking available supplies. While hard won markets in the UK will still need to be maintained, the expectation is that the industry will start to see a significant increase in licence approvals later in 2020 which will signal a return to normal conditions in terms of issuing of licence approvals.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to host two weekly conference calls with both Coillte and Forest Industries Ireland to monitor progress on felling licences and related issues. I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

The report focused on a sample of farms with less than &euro;8,000 of 'Standard Output' (i.e. the average monetary value of the agricultural output at farm-gate price). They found that 37% of farms nationally were classified as small farms, farming 16% of the total farmland area and producing approximately 5% of the total standard output of Irish agriculture. </p>  <p>  In terms of economic sustainability, the report found that smaller farms tended to be less productive and less efficient and employed lower levels of labour. They tended to rely heavily on direct payment support and/or off-farm employment. Collectively, small farms accounted for 13% of the national envelope for CAP Pillar 1 payments. Half of all small farms were classified as economically vulnerable. Despite this, 85% of small farm operators intended to continue farming. </p>  <p>  In terms of environmental sustainability, the report found that smaller farms tended to have lower nitrogen and phosphorous balances on a per hectare basis. They also produced lower levels of GHG emissions in absolute terms, although they were less efficient in terms of units of output produced.  </p>  <p>  The report also notes that small farms in the EU play a number of important socioeconomic roles including maintaining rural welfare; keeping rural areas populated; contributing to the rural non-farm economy and providing environmental public goods such as attractive landscapes. </p>  <p>  Teagasc plan to carry out this survey again in 2021, although the timeframe may be impacted by Covid-19 restrictions.</p></reply>

This system will replace the current 25 year old system.Additional specialist ICT resources were required to augment our internal IMT team primarily in the design, development and support of this major ICT system.  The services of external contracted resources were procured by availing of open EU procurement processes and a contract was subsequently awarded to Version 1.</p><p>The LPIS is the Department&rsquo;s land database which underpins payments to farmers under area-based schemes such as the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) the Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme (ANC), afforestation schemes and the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS). </p><p>The overall objective is to ensure the most efficient delivery of &euro;1.6 billion of EU-funded scheme payments to applicants, in line with regulatory requirements.  The new LPIS will give farmers a more accurate representation of land parcel boundaries and will be based on the most up-to-date technologies and Ordnance Survey Ireland mapping standards.  </p><p>The new LPIS was first introduced in Louth in 2019 and was rolled out to an additional five counties (Meath, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, and Longford) in 2020 with more counties scheduled for roll-out in 2021.  The Department will continue the roll out of the new LPIS on a phased basis over the next two years, with all counties expected to be live in the new system by 2022.</p><p>The roll out has been underpinned by a comprehensive communication campaign to help farmers understand the changeover to the new system.This included regular correspondence and a comprehensive statement of land with details of the parcels held by the farmer and the resultant changes to these parcels arising from the move to the new LPIS.  In addition, regional public information sessions were hosted by the Department in 2019 to inform farmers, agents and farm bodies of the transition to the new system.  However, in line with HSE advice, the information  sessions scheduled for March 2020 were cancelled.<b></b>Further information on the LPIS as well as details relating to frequently asked questions can be found online at: <i>www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/lpisrebuildproject/</i></p><p>There is also an information line to assist farmers with their queries while current Covid-19 restrictions remain in place.

This is an ongoing deliberative process.  The development of a plan to implement EID will require consultation with all relevant stakeholders including the farming organisations.</p>  <p>  The use of EID tags has the potential to deliver a substantial improvement in the bovine identification system for farmers, livestock marts, slaughter plants, export assembly centres, veterinarians and the Department. The electronic scanning of bovines presented at outlets such as marts and factories will assist a move to a paperless system and enable accurate data capture facilitated by automated reporting of animal movements to the AIM system and thus improving the speed, reliability and accuracy of the traceability system.  EID in bovines has the capacity also to provide a safer working environment for all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The cost of bovine identification tags is set by approved tag suppliers. The current additional cost to farmers of purchasing an electronic identification tag is between &euro;1.05 - &euro;1.11 per animal.</p></reply>

To this end, carcase classification controls in slaughter plants are carried out by a dedicated team of specialist staff in the Beef Carcase Classification Section within my Department.  Their remit under EU legislation is to carry out un-announced inspections to ensure that meat plants comply with these legislative requirements for classification.  277 inspections were carried out to date in 2020.  </p>  <p>  Performance of machine grading is monitored at each inspection to ensure the machines operate within tolerance at all times. As with any mechanical system, grading machines can from time to time fall out of tolerance. Where a machine is found operating outside of tolerance, DAFM instructs the factory to cease mechanical classification. When any mechanical system is found to be working outside of these tolerances, the meat plants concerned are instructed to revert to manual grading.  </p>  <p>  In this scenario, the factory must arrange for the classification machine to be serviced. When this service is completed, the Department is notified, and classification officers will proceed to conduct a further classification exercise (min 100 carcasses) to confirm that it is in working within the legal tolerances before mechanical grading is allowed to recommence.</p>  <p>  In all cases, where a factory was instructed to revert to manual grading, manual grading is initiated, and this is advised to farmers through their remittance dockets.  </p>  <p>  Publication of details regarding factories that have been found to be non-compliant with the legislation is addressed in SI 254/2019 &lsquo;European Union (Carcase Classification and Price Reporting) Regulations 2019&rsquo;.  This legislation outlines that the Minister may publish a list of factories where on-the spot fines were applied.  However, no fines are applicable in these 2 cases. My Department is committed to publishing the list of non-compliant factories at the end of each calendar year.</p></reply>

The Review indicated a pattern of costs consistent with those found in other jurisdictions, including England, New Zealand and Scotland, which I identified a dominance of staff costs in the make-up of the overall cost figures. Specifically, staffing costs were found, on average, to account for approximately 70% of the cost of delivering childcare across all services, including ECCE-only services, with non-staff costs covering the remaining 30%.</p>  <p>  ECCE providers are paid two different capitation rates.  Providers with room leaders that hold a degree qualification (Level 7 or above) in Early Childhood Care and Education receive a higher capitation rate of &euro;80.25 per child, per week, equivalent to &euro;5.35 per hour, per child. An estimated 53.5% of ECCE providers are in receipt of the higher capitation rate. A standard capitation rate of &euro;69 per week per child registered for ECCE, equivalent to &euro;4.60 per hour, per child, is paid to services with Level 6 and 5 staff. In addition to ECCE capitation, funding provided to ECCE providers includes the Programme Support Payments, which total &euro;19.4m across the full sector per annum, and AIM Inclusion Coordinator payments. </p>  <p>  In a sustainable service, it is expected that funding related to the ECCE Programme covers the costs of delivering this Programme with a margin of profit or surplus for individual providers. </p>  <p>  The Independent Review of the Cost of Delivering Childcare in Ireland, from which the above analysis derived, was undertaken by Crowe in 2018 on behalf of my Department. The brief included:</p>  <p>  - analysing the current costs of providing childcare and the factors that impact on these costs;</p>  <p>  - the development and delivery of a model of the unit costs of providing childcare that allows analysis of policy changes and variation in cost-drivers, including the potential impact of professionalisation; and</p>  <p>  - providing an objective, high-level market analysis of the childcare sector in Ireland, including analysis of fee levels charged to parents.</p>  <p>  The approach and methodology for this Review included:</p>  <p>  - engagement with key stakeholders from the sector, including the Early Years Forum, provider representative organisations, the City and County Childcare Committees, statutory bodies, childcare professional training bodies, and academics;</p>  <p>  - the administration of a survey to all centre-based childcare providers nationally, to provide the data on which the modelling tool would be based;</p>  <p>  - the development of a cost modelling tool (and guidance document) to present the baseline cost data and enable the testing of the impact of a range of scenarios, namely changes to cost drivers on the unit costs of delivering childcare services; and</p>  <p>  - a final report detailing the elements of the review, and the key findings.</p>  <p>  This Review is intended to provide a robust evidence base for the further development of high quality childcare in Ireland. The outputs, including the costs calculator developed through this project are also intended to form a key input into the setting of capitation and subvention rates for future funding schemes and will be considered by the Expert Group convened to develop a new funding model.</p>  <p>  The draft final report, cost modelling tool and guidance were subject to peer review. Arising from the external peer review, an additional piece of work was undertaken. Final outputs were received in January 2020, and preparation was underway to launch the report in April 2020. However, owing to COVID-19, its launch was postponed. Nevertheless, the data from this Review has already informed the work of my Department, in particular the Department&rsquo;s funding response to COVID-19.</p></reply>

On that basis, the data below is presented with reference to a wage of &euro;12.30 per hour, rather than &euro;11.90 per hour. Based on figures available to my Department (drawn from the Pobal Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2018/19), of approximately 26,000 practitioners working directly with children, it is estimated that 60% (or 15,600) are paid less than &euro;12.30 per hour. The remaining 40% (or 10,400) are paid more than &euro;12.30 per hour.</p>  <p>  On this basis, it can be estimated that the annual cost of raising the wages of all early learning and care and school-age childcare practitioners to at least &euro;12.30 per hour would be approximately &euro;30 million. This figure represents an average increase of 12% in gross pay. The additional cost to employers for this in terms of employer PRSI and holiday pay would be &euro;6m, bringing the total cost to &euro;36m. </p>  <p>  My Department does not currently have a breakdown of this cost specifically for raising the wages for practitioners who hold a level 5 award as their highest qualification. It should be noted, however, that a proportion of those working in the sector who have qualifications higher than level 5 (at levels 6, 7 and 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications) also earn less than &euro;12.30 per hour.

September to December 2020 and January to December 2021 costs are provided.</p><p>The cost estimates are arrived at by:</p><p>- establishing the number of families with children under 15 years by income bracket (data supplied by CSO) and</p><p>- profiling these families by reference to the age of their children and</p><p>- estimating the proportion of children in each income bracket and age range using centre-based care and</p><p>- calculating estimated subsidy rates based on income levels and age profile and</p><p>- applying estimates of the average hours used by age group for term time and non-term time.</p><p>The scheme&rsquo;s cost model is based on key assumptions around the preferences and behaviours of parents relating to working hours and childcare choice, rates of growth in demand, and certain metrics are extrapolated from available data. As such, all estimates remain heavily caveated insofar as the scheme represents a considerable departure from existing schemes and this renders estimates inherently challenging. </p><p>It is particularly difficult to estimate the behavioural changes that will result from significant increases in the level of subsidy available. The greater the increase in subsidy, the less reliable are the estimates. It is therefore possible that the total costs &ndash; and numbers of children benefiting &ndash; may be significantly greater than indicated in the table below, especially for the larger increases in subsidy rates. </p><p>It should be noted that the figures in the table for the number of children benefiting relate only to children whose parents claim the universal subsidy. As increases in universal subsidies automatically result in increases in targeted subsidies for most or all beneficiaries of targeted subsidies, a larger number of children would benefit whose parents claim targeted subsidies. <table>    <tr>       <th>Universal Rate</th>       <th>.50c </th>       <th>&euro;1</th>       <th>&euro;1.50 </th>       <th>&euro;2</th>       <th>&euro;2.50 </th>       <th>&euro;3</th>       <th>&euro;3.50 </th>       <th>&euro;4.00</th>       <th>&euro;4.50 </th>       <th>&euro;5.00 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sept to Dec 2020 Cost</td>       <td>Zero</td>       <td>&euro;8m</td>       <td>&euro;17m</td>       <td>&euro;27m</td>       <td>&euro;37m</td>       <td>&euro;48m</td>       <td>&euro;60m</td>       <td>&euro;75m</td>       <td>&euro;95m</td>       <td>&euro;122m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 Cost</td>       <td>Zero</td>       <td>&euro; 25m</td>       <td>&euro; 52m</td>       <td>&euro; 81m</td>       <td>&euro; 112m</td>       <td>&euro; 145m</td>       <td>&euro; 180m</td>       <td>&euro; 224m</td>       <td>&euro; 285m</td>       <td>&euro; 365m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total number of children under 3 estimated to claim a universal subsidy</td>       <td>15,900</td>       <td>16,300</td>       <td>16,700</td>       <td>17,100</td>       <td>17,500</td>       <td>17,900</td>       <td>18,300</td>       <td>18,700</td>       <td>19,100</td>       <td>19,500</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>People who qualify for enhanced hours are always better off on targeted subsidies,  so people with children who qualify for the universal rate will receive higher targeted subsides. </p><p>With the significant level of rate increases costed above, the volume of applicants could increase in large numbers, hence, annual review and re-costing will be required as investment increases.</p></reply>

Their roles included offering information, support and training to childminders; maintaining the voluntary notification system; and administering other supports for childminders. The Childminding Advisory Officer posts were largely discontinued in 2012-2013 in the context of widespread budget cuts at that time. </p>  <p>  In 2019 my Department put in place a National Childminding Coordinator, who is located within the Department, and 6 Childminding Development Officers, who are located within City and County Childcare Committees around the country and who have a regional remit.

The cost of these posts is &euro;500,000 per annum, which includes costs for salaries, PRSI, travel and subsistence and overheads.

Of these, it is estimated that 26.8% (7,204) held a level 5 major award as their highest qualification and 41.8% (11,237) held a level 6 major award as their highest qualification. On this basis and if the level of State funding remained the same as the maximum amount of funding available under the current Learner Fund bursary (i.e. a contribution to costs of &euro;750 per student), the additional cost to the Learner Fund would be &euro;5.4m to bring all 7,204 early learning and care practitioners holding a level 5 qualification at the time of the survey up to a Level 6 qualification. To bring 50% of the 11,237 early learning and care practitioners holding a level 6 qualification at the time of the survey up to a Level 7 qualification, the increase in the cost of the Learner Fund (with a bursary of &euro;750 per student) would be &euro;4.214m.</p>  <p>  These figures are based on the value of previous Learner Fund bursaries. The full cost of undertaking a Level 6 qualification for a level 5 practitioner is greater than &euro;750, and the cost for a practitioner of undertaking a Level 7 degree is even higher. These costs, which are borne by practitioners, vary depending on a number of factors, including where the individual chooses to undertake their course, as course fees vary. If the State were to meet the full cost for these practitioners of undertaking Level 6 and 7 courses, the costs would be considerably higher than indicated above.</p></reply>

Piloting Baby Boxes is just one initiative which is part of a wide ranging strategy addressing various aspects of the lives of children from birth to age five including supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care and health initiatives. </p>  <p>  The gift of the Baby Box is intended as a welcome from the State for a new arrival to a family and an acknowledgement of this very significant moment for parents. The universal distribution of Baby Boxes also reflects an important equality principle that each child is given something of equal value at the start of their life. The concept of Baby Boxes originates in Finland (and has been implemented in a number of other countries) and consists of a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood. Key objectives with the Baby Box and linked communications will include support for parent-infant bonding, information on baby development and early learning, advice and support for breastfeeding and promotion of infant health and safety.</p>  <p>  The pilot will undertake research and consultation to determine items for inclusion in the pack and these may include safety items, baby clothes and toys to support early development and books to foster a love of reading from infancy.</p>  <p>  Following consultation on items for inclusion, it is envisaged that a tender competition will be run to select a provider that will be in a position to develop the baby box, including the entire contents and oversee distribution. </p>  <p>  Due to COVID related workload, I cannot provide exact timelines for the roll out of the pilot, but the scoping phase began in late 2019/early 2020 and it is likely that it will be early 2021 before the Request for Tender is issued.</p>  <p>  There will be a significant emphasis in the pilot on consultation and engagement with parents and of evaluation of the impact of this measure, including cost-benefit analysis, with a view to determining whether this initiative is suitable for wider roll-out.  If the results of the pilot evaluation deem the baby box initiative suitable for roll-out, based on a unit cost of &euro;170 (to include the baby box and distribution) and the average number of births (approximately 60,000 per annum), the cost of a full roll-out would be approximately &euro;10.2 million.</p></reply>

AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school service. </p>  <p>  Additional assistance can be sought in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE pre-school programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund pre-school Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult-to-child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, AIM Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. </p>  <p>  AIM is intrinsically linked to the ECCE programme and since its implementation in 2016 AIM supports are provided based on the 38 week ECCE programme year from September to June. As the ECCE term 2019/20 is now finished, AIM funding for additional assistance in the ECCE pre-school room is therefore not currently available until the next ECCE programme year recommences in late August.</p>  <p>  Funding schemes that provide subsidies for places in early learning and care and school-age childcare services - the National Childcare Scheme and legacy funding schemes (CCSP and TEC) - recommenced on 29 June and continue to operate during the summer months. Information on eligibility is available from my Department's website and from local City and County Childcare Committees.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the unprecedented environment some children with disabilities are currently facing due to the impact of COVID-19. A key element of AIM is the advice and guidance given by Early Years Specialists in Better Start to service providers who are supporting the participation of children with disabilities in their settings. In recognition of the challenges facing families and service providers at the current time, my Department has worked with Better Start to make the advice and guidance provided by Better Start's Early Years Specialists available to any early learning and care or school-age childcare service that is catering for a child with a disability during the summer months.</p></reply>

This funding was needed to cover the costs of operating with lower occupancy due to reduced parental demand, a feature I hope will change over time, and to cover extra, public health related costs.</p>  <p>  The cost of this package to the end of the year is estimated at &euro;87.4m EWSS and &euro;211m for DCYA schemes and sustainability. This totals &euro;298.4m. Services operating from 24 August to end 2020 with EWSS will have approximately 65% of payroll costs covered. The estimated cost of continuing this wage subsidy scheme to cover 85% of payroll costs on a strictly pro rata basis is approximately &euro;114m. This assumes usual payroll costs continue to be incurred.  However, changes to usual staffing levels will be needed for this operating period in order to implement public health guidance.  Therefore estimated costs covering different percentage of staff costs can differ significantly due to different operating conditions and staffing requirements. </p></reply>

The TWSCS was layered on top of the Revenue TWSS and provided additional funding towards childcare staff wages to ensure that they could be retained by their employer. </p>  <p>  The TWSCS operated from 6 April 2020 for a period of 12 weeks. Over this period, &euro;24.3m was allocated to childcare services to top up the wages of their staff. The wage top up was made available to 3,900 childcare services that signed up to and submitted applications for the TWSCS. </p>  <p>  To ensure prompt payment in these challenging circumstances for employers, estimated payments were made initially, with reconciliations following to ensure accurate payments based on actual staff numbers. Pobal, on behalf of the Department, continues to administer and reconcile TWSCS applications and the final actual cost will be known shortly.</p></reply>

On 25 July I announced a package of measures to support the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Care Childcare sector as remaining services reopen in late August/early September. </p><p>The funding package will enable providers to continue to operate with lower capacity and extra operating costs. The continued financial support will benefit parents as well as providers as providers will not need to pass on increased costs to parents through increased fees. </p><p>The details of the package are as follows:</p><p>Part 1: DCYA and Revenue Funding Measures</p><p>The funding package for the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) sector from 24 August to end 2020 includes:</p><p>- Continuation of all DCYA ELC and SAC subsidy schemes (NCS, CCSP, TEC) and resumption of the ECCE Programme at existing capitation and subsidy rates, including ECCE Higher Capitation;</p><p>- Access to the Revenue-operated EWSS. This will cover an average of 38% of the costs of individual services.</p><p>- A sustainability fund will be accessible to providers (not-for-profit and for-profit) who can demonstrate that the other measures are not sufficient by themselves to enable viable operation of their business.</p><p>- The cost of the funding package to 31 December is estimated at &euro;87.4m EWSS and &euro;211m for Department schemes and sustainability. This totals &euro;298.4m.</p><p>Part 2: Temporary changes to administrative procedures</p><p>- In addition to this funding package, my Department has introduced, on a temporary basis, added flexibility on attendance rules due to the likelihood in greater variability in patterns of usage (see below).  This will assist providers to maximise income and reduce costs.</p><p>- That NCS will allow for 2 hours variation in attendance against registration per week without triggering a report. This is not 2 extra hours per week in terms of registrations; it is a fluctuation against normal attendance patterns which is exceptional to the current environment. Providers will revert to actual attendance levels when the emergency levels are no longer deemed to be required.</p><p>- For non NCS: A 30 minute variance tolerance per day per child; e.g. if the child is being picked up at 4 hours 45 minutes attendance, this will enable the cr&egrave;che retain the full-time rate. The purpose of this is to facilitate staggered drop-ins/pick-ups necessary to avoid clustering of parents/children at those times. This is expected to apply to non-ECCE services only.</p><p>- Both these measures are exceptional and will last until end 2020. The situation will be reviewed at that time; record keeping, attendance tracking reporting arrangements and compliance facilitation remains in place for the duration.</p><p>Part 3: Other Supports Available Across Government</p><p>The July Stimulus includes other supports that ELC and SAC services may be eligible for, depending on the specific circumstances and eligibility criteria, including:</p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme</p><p>- The 6-month waiver of commercial rates</p><p>- The Restart Grant for Enterprises</p><p>- The early carry-back of trading losses for previously profitable companies</p><p>- The new income tax relief for self-employed individuals who were profitable in 2019 but, as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, incur losses in 2020 </p><p>- Legislation for the previously announced warehousing of tax liabilities</p><p>- Liquidity and enterprise investment measures provided via MicroFinance Ireland and LEOs</p><p>The above is in addition to the &euro;14.2m Capital Grants and the &euro;18m Reopening Support Grants that have been made available to services and which the deadline of 28 August for application applies.</p><p>My Department oversees a Case Management process through which local CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care services. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.  Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering initial, and on-going, case management assistance. </p><p>Case Management support is available for all services. Support is available to help services remain open if it is an option they would like to consider. Any service that believes they may require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance. Even in cases where a service decides they cannot remain open, Case Management support can still be provided to aid an orderly wind down and if possible, the transfer of the service to an alternative provider.</p><p>In relation to the particular childcare facility raised by the Deputy, I understand that payments to the service have been put on hold due to their current listing on the CRO as not of &quot;Normal&quot; status which is a prerequisite for payment .  </p><p>It is normal procedure to put services with this status on hold until they have filed their accounts and thereby return to &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; status. Once the service meets the conditions set out to them in relation to regaining their &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; CRO status, the Department will release the funding due to the service. </p></reply>

The brief included:</p><p>- analysing the current costs of providing childcare and the factors that impact on these costs;</p><p>- the development and delivery of a model of the unit costs of providing childcare that allows analysis of policy changes and variation in cost-drivers, including the potential impact of professionalisation; and</p><p>- providing an objective, high-level market analysis of the childcare sector in Ireland, including analysis of fee levels charged to parents.</p><p>The approach and methodology for this Review included:</p><p>- engagement with key stakeholders from the sector, including the Early Years Forum, provider representative organisations, the City and County Childcare Committees, statutory bodies, childcare professional training bodies, and academics;</p><p>- the administration of a survey to all centre-based childcare providers nationally, to provide the data on which the modelling tool would be based;</p><p>- the development of a cost modelling tool (and guidance document) to present the baseline cost data and enable the testing of the impact of a range of scenarios, namely changes to cost drivers on the unit costs of delivering childcare services; and</p><p>- a final report detailing the elements of the review, and the key findings.</p><p>This Review is intended to provide a robust evidence base for the further development of high quality childcare in Ireland. The outputs, including the costs calculator developed through this project are also intended to form a key input into the setting of capitation and subvention rates for future funding schemes and will be considered by the Expert Group convened to develop a new funding model.</p><p>The draft final report, cost modelling tool and guidance were subject to peer review. Arising from the external peer review, an additional piece of work was undertaken. Final outputs were received in January 2020, and preparation was underway to launch the report in April 2020. However, owing to COVID-19, its launch was postponed. Nevertheless, the data from this Review has already informed the work of my Department, in particular the Department&rsquo;s funding response to COVID-19.</p><p>As part of this Review, the broad components of the full cost of delivering childcare was identified. This suggested a pattern consistent with those found in other jurisdictions, including England, New Zealand and Scotland, whereby a dominance of staff costs in the make-up of the overall cost figures. Specifically, on average, staffing costs were found to account for approximately 70% of the total cost of delivering childcare across all services, including ECCE-only services. The costing analysis did not include profit or surplus.</p><p>Whilst the average proportion of total cost represented by staffing costs varies marginally, it is at a minimum, more than two-thirds of the total cost of delivering childcare, regardless of different provider types.</p></reply>

Supporting services as they reopen, and ensuring that capacity is sufficient to meet demand, is a key priority of my Department.</p>  <p>  The Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2019 demonstrated that, prior to the disruption caused by COVID-19, the sector was running at near capacity.  Expert guidance on the safe reopening of ELC and SAC services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on 29 May. The guidance recommends, amongst other measures, the use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model to restrict interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. The public health advice does not require any change to minimum adult-child ratios or to regulatory space requirements. While some settings may reduce capacity depending on their layout, there are no absolute requirements for capacity reduction, and most services should be able to comply with the public health advice with no or little reduction in capacity.</p>  <p>  While it is difficult to predict with certainty the number of children returning to these services, it is anticipated that enrolment in the ECCE Programme may reach an average of 85%-90% of the eligible cohort, while demand for fulltime and part time ELC and SAC could average 60% initially.</p>  <p>  Data from wave 2 of a survey of parents conducted on behalf of my Department by IPSOS MRBI from June 19 to July 10 found that 61% of parents using centre-based ELC and SAC services pre-COVID-19 plan to return their children to these services. This represents an increase of 11 percentage points from Wave 1 of this survey, collected from May 22-24, suggesting that confidence is growing among parents.</p>  <p>  The latest package of measures to support the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare sector to operate from September recognises that a reduced number of children are likely to attend ELC and SAC services - at least initially. This funding package is tailored to allow providers to operate with potentially less parental income and to assist in meeting the increased costs associated with complying with public health requirements in a lower occupancy scenario.</p>  <p>  The funding package for the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) sector from 24 August to end 2020 includes:</p>  <p>  - Continuation of all DCYA ELC and SAC subsidy schemes (NCS, CCSP, TEC) and resumption of the ECCE Programme at existing capitation and subsidy rates, including ECCE Higher Capitation.</p>  <p>  - Access to the Revenue-operated EWSS. This will cover an average of 38% of the costs of individual services.</p>  <p>  - A sustainability fund will be accessible to providers (not-for-profit and for-profit) who can demonstrate that the other measures are not sufficient by themselves to enable viable operation of their business.</p>  <p>  The continued financial support will benefit parents as well as providers as providers will not need to pass on increased costs to parents through increased fees.</p>  <p>  A key policy priority for the Department in this process is the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector and hence it has and continues to work intensively to support services to reopen after COVID-19. The reopening funding aims to support providers to reopen, staff to remain in the sector, parents to resume work, and children to benefit from quality ELC and SAC.</p>  <p>  The latest data shows that 85% of services that ordinarily operate in July and August have now reopened.</p>  <p>  76% of the 4500 services normally open in September have already applied for a reopening grant, and as the closing date for application is August 28, I expect this figure to increase significantly in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Of 2,624 services contacted, 85% indicated they were planning on reopening, while 2% indicated they were not. The rest had not decided at that time.</p><p>Expert guidance on the safe reopening of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on Friday, 29 May.  The guidance recommends use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model which restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. Based on advice provided by the HPSC, the Regulations in relation to the adult-child ratios and the floor-space requirements for ELC or SAC services have not been amended as such changes are unnecessary where &quot;play pods&quot; are in use.</p><p>While some settings may reduce capacity depending on their layout, there are no required capacity reductions, and most services should be able to comply with the public health advice with no or little reduction in the number of places provided.</p><p>The Tusla Early Years Inspectorate maintains the register of early years services and so collates data on closures and new services registered. Every year some services close and some new services open. Currently data for both closures and new services are down slightly when compared with the same period last year, and overall there is no significant variation in the number of services operating in 2020 when compared with 2019.</p><p>The interim public health advice received by the Department of Education and Skills sets out the key public health requirements that will be required for a safe full reopening of schools in late August/ September and the measures that will be required to achieve this.</p><p>In relation to the reopening of childcare services that operate on school premises, officials in my Department have been in contact with colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills.

It provides children with their first formal experience of early learning prior to commencing primary school.</p>  <p>  Children are eligible to enrol in this Programme once they are 2 years and 8 months of age in the September of a given programme year and are eligible to avail of two years of the programme (provided that they are not older than 5 years and 6 months at the end of the programme year year). Ordinarily, the proportion of children availing on this full entitlement is determined by a range of factors, including the child&rsquo;s month of birth, parental choice with regard to school starting age and average uptake rates since the Programme was introduced.</p>  <p>  Based on birth data from the CSO, data on school starting age from the Department of Education and Skills and assuming normal uptake rates of 95%, it is estimated that approximately 106,000 children will enrol in the ECCE Programme 2020/2021 this September.</p>  <p>  Owing to COVID-19, it is expected that the numbers of children enrolling in the Programme will be lower - at least initially. While it is difficult to predict with certainty, it is anticipated that enrolment in the ECCE Programme may reach an average of 85%-90% of the eligible cohort - or between 95,000 and 101,000 children.</p>  <p>  The registration process for the ECCE Programme 2020/21 opens on 17 August, one week before the programme is due to commence. Therefore, more accurate estimates of ECCE Programme among wth eligible age cohort will be available from end August - early September.</p></reply>

Parental alienation has been described as a situation when a child&rsquo;s resistance or hostility towards one parent is not justified and is the result of psychological manipulation by the other parent. The issue of parental alienation is highly complex and I am aware that some professionals advocate for the classification of parental alienation as a clinical disorder affecting children, while others raise concerns that taking this action could act as a means of masking other serious issues such as genuine allegations of child abuse. The phenomenon most commonly occurs in the course of family break-up or divorce.</p>  <p>  While there is no specific legislative provision regarding parental alienation in Irish family law, section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or wellbeing. There is also a range of legislative provisions in place for dealing with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that the Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on Reform of the Family Law System, which was published late last year, considered the issue of parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.  All of the recommendations in the report are currently being examined by my Department.</p></reply>

The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017.  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  </p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for the phased transition from adult wardship to the new decision-making support arrangements that will be available under the 2015 Act.  It provides for the review by the wardship court of the capacity of all current adult wards of court within three years of the commencement of Part 6 of the 2015 Act.  In each case, the ward shall be discharged from wardship and the court shall order that the property of the former ward be returned to him or her.  The safeguards and procedures of the 2015 Act will apply to a former ward who transitions to any of the new decision-making support arrangements available under the 2015 Act.  The current wards of court system will continue to operate until Part 6 of the 2015 Act is commenced.  It is not possible to commence Part 6 of the Act until the DSS is operational and ready to roll out the new decision-making support options that will be available under the 2015 Act.   </p>  <p>  A range of amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 have been identified as necessary for the proper operation of the 2015 Act, taking account of issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, the working groups developing draft codes of practice under the 2015 Act, and submissions received from other bodies.  The amendments to the 2015 Act will be brought forward by way of a stand-alone Bill.  Work is ongoing in the Department on the General Scheme, with a view to Government approval being sought as soon as possible for the priority drafting of the Bill.  The Deputy will understand that it is not possible for me to predict the outcome of the legislative process with regard to this or any other Bill.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act also requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options.  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.  The Steering Group has given detailed consideration to the feasibility of commencing the remaining uncommenced provisions of the Act however, due to the complexity of the Act and the interconnectivity of its provisions, it is not possible to make any further commencement orders until the DSS is operational.

The Court, on reviewing the evidence presented, will direct an independent assessment by the Court's medical visitor, a psychiatrist.  The Court's determination of the application is based upon the three reports confirming the person lacks capacity.  The application is heard in open Court and the person is given an opportunity to object to application if they choose to. </p>  <p>  The Wards of Court Office will take into account previously expressed wishes or a ward of court and where it is in the interests of the ward will take into account the views and opinions of the ward in conjunction with those of the committee. </p>  <p>  As part of the Order bringing a person into wardship, the court always appoints a Committee of the person of the ward and a Committee of the Estate of the ward (usually the same person).  While the Committee acts under the directions of the court, the Committee will provide the Office of Wards of Court the views of the ward as well as making sure that the ward's personal needs are met. </p>  <p>  The Committee appointed is usually, but not always, the family member who makes the wardship application.  In cases where there is no suitable relative who is prepared to act, or where there is disagreement among the ward's relatives which cannot be resolved, or where a conflict of interest arises, the court may appoint the &ldquo;General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court&rdquo; to act as Committee.  The General Solicitor is a public official in the service of the State. </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.  The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017.  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  </p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 provides for the phased transition from adult wardship to the new decision-making support arrangements that will be available under the 2015 Act.  It provides for the review by the wardship court of the capacity of all current adult wards of court within three years of the commencement of Part 6 of the 2015 Act.  In each case, the ward shall be discharged from wardship and the court shall order that the property of the former ward be returned to him or her.  The safeguards and procedures of the 2015 Act will apply to a former ward who transitions to any of the new decision-making support arrangements available under the 2015 Act.  The current wards of court system will continue to operate until Part 6 of the 2015 Act is commenced.  It is not possible to commence Part 6 of the Act until the DSS is operational and ready to roll out the new decision-making support options that will be available under the 2015 Act.   </p>  <p>  A range of amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 have been identified as necessary for the proper operation of the 2015 Act, taking account of issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, the working groups developing draft codes of practice under the 2015 Act, and submissions received from other bodies.  The amendments to the 2015 Act will be brought forward by way of a stand-alone Bill.  Work is ongoing in the Department on the General Scheme, with a view to Government approval being sought as soon as possible for the priority drafting of the Bill. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act also requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options.  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.  The Steering Group has given detailed consideration to the feasibility of commencing the remaining  provisions of the Act however, due to the complexity of the Act and the interconnectivity of its provisions, it is not possible to make any further commencement orders until the DSS is operational.  The DSS, led by its Director, is working tirelessly to put in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act.  The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS.  These key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed to enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate.

The group initially included the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities.  It was subsequently agreed to meet in subgroup format involving the primary stakeholders, namely Department of Justice and Equality, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Office of the Attorney General.  </p>  <p>  The subgroup most recently met in December 2019.  At that meeting, the group agreed that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which has primary responsibility for road traffic legislation, would explore the feasibility of developing new legislative provisions in road traffic legislation, which would seek to deliver the benefits sought by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without unintended consequences for existing law.  It was also agreed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would explore further targeted enforcement measures, while the Department of Justice and Equality would consider and develop actions in order to increase awareness of the dangers of these vehicles jointly with affected communities, community groups and other stakeholders, and explore how best to engage with young persons who are drawn to this behaviour.  The Department is currently examining options in this area, with due regard to social distancing requirements. </p>  <p>  On foot of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it was previously agreed that, in the main, current legislative provisions appeared to be sufficient.  Nonetheless, it was also agreed that the group would remain open to considering workable legislative solutions to any specific legislative gaps identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was in this context that further discussion took place at the meeting in December.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has primary responsibility for road traffic legislation and for bringing forward any new legislative provisions which would seek to deliver the commitments on quad bikes and scramblers contained in the new Programme for Government - Our Shared Future.</p>  <p>  The Lord Mayor's Commission on anti-social behaviour was an initiative of the then Lord Mayor of Dublin and it reported in 2012.  It made a very valuable contribution to thinking on ways to address anti-social behaviour.  Many of the themes which it raised are also featured in the draft Youth Justice Strategy published by my Department which has recently been the subject of a public consultation process.  Issues such as the need for early intervention and family support, coupled with collaborative working by agencies and community partners, highlighted by the Lord Mayor's Commission, are central to the approach contained in the Youth Justice Strategy.  I intend to bring the finalised Strategy to Government later this year for approval. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the Deputy will be aware of the commitment in the Programme for Government to convene an expert forum on anti-social behaviour and this will provide a key focus for further development of policy in this area.</p></reply>

The purpose of the event was to bring the women together and to ask their view on a suitable memorial.  Their report was only recently provided to my Department. It must be understood that there were different views among the women as to the type of memorial that ought to be established.  At this time, two possible locations for a memorial have been identified at the sites of former Magdalen Laundries, Sean McDermott Street, Dublin and High Park, Dublin.  </p>  <p>  My officials have been in contact with Dublin City Council in relation to the development of a memorial at the Sean McDermott Street site and I am informed that the site is currently the subject of a planning application for redevelopment which will include a Magdalen memorial space.  </p>  <p>  Separately, the Respond Housing Agency have been granted development consent for a housing development at the site of the former Magdalen Laundry in High Park, Dublin.  The Respond Housing Agency have committed to making a garden space available as a memorial and wrote to my Department last week indicating that they are ready to advance the development of a memorial.  My Department is committed to providing certain funding for each of these memorials and will continue to work with other relevant agencies to progress matters. </p>  <p>  Chapter 6 of the McAleese Report sets out the approach in relation to the archive.  The McAleese Committee agreed that the archive be deposited and stored centrally with the Department of the Taoiseach, noting the approach taken in relation to archiving set out in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. </p>  <p>  The Committee decided that the archive contains only copies of state records, in order to avoid disturbance to or destruction of original or archived files.  The originals of all such records identified, many of which were already archived, and some of which are covered by the National Archives Act 1986, remain in their original files and locations.  While the McAleese Report acknowledges that the archive may be a resource for future research, there are no immediate plans at this stage to provide access to the McAleese archive.  However, this position is being kept under review.</p></reply>

The Immigration Act 2004 provides for the grounds on which an individual may be granted or refused leave to land at a port of entry.</p><p>Further information on visa requirements and documentation recommended for entry into the State is available on our website at : </p><p>The Government is advising against non-essential travel until further notice and anyone entering the State is required to self-isolate for 14 days unless arriving from one of the countries on the Covid-19 Green List published by the Department of the Taoiseach. All passengers are required to complete a mandatory Public Health Passenger Locator Form on arrival.</p><p>The longstanding policy in this area is that attending an online course is not a valid reason to be present in the State. The only exception to this was during the Covid-19 restrictions when language schools physically closed and such schools were allowed to conduct online courses for continuing students only.My Department wrote to such English language schools on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) in this regard.</p><p>To facilitate Higher Education Students whose courses may not start as usual, the Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) function of my Department intends that all visas which issue to students for the September intake will be valid until a latest date of 31 January 2021, with a maximum validity of 6 months rather than the usual 3 month period. For example:</p><p>1. Visa issued 31/07/2020 &ndash; valid to 31/01/2021 (6 months)</p><p>2. Visa issued 15/09/2020 &ndash; valid to 31/01/2021 (4.5 months)</p><p>3.

The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for offences of theft, the handling of stolen property and the possession of stolen property.  The offence of theft provided for by this legislation would, based on the broad nature of the offence, include the theft of dogs.  A maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment is provided for in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;&oacute;ch&aacute;na closely monitors emerging crime trends, and that the Garda National Crime Prevention Unit coordinates a number of crime prevention initiatives aimed at reducing crime. These initiatives include Crime Prevention Information Campaigns through traditional and social media. Recently information has been disseminated to the Crime Prevention Officers Network countrywide specifically dealing with the topic of dog thefts. The National Crime Prevention Units advice on pet safety concur with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe. </p>  <p>  Ongoing patrols throughout the country act as a deterrent to travelling criminals and thereby prevent criminal activity.  Improved awareness of dog thefts among the community will ensure more vigilance within neighbourhood watch and community alert areas.</p>  <p>  As part of ongoing efforts to keeping communities and property safe, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.88 billion for 2020, as well as capital funding of over &euro;116 million this year.  This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation.  Garda numbers are now at their highest ever, with approximately 14,700 members and almost 3,000 Garda staff nationwide.</p></reply>

Implementation of the Strategy is led by my colleagues the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for Public Health, Well Being and the National Drugs Strategy, although the Strategy of course includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>I am aware of the issues raised by the Deputy in connection with nitrous oxide, as well as the potential negative health implications of the unintended and unrestricted uses of this product. The health issues related to nitrous oxide are proper to the Department of Health, the HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and I understand that the HPRA has previously issued advisories on the misuse of this substance. I further understand that the HSE has recently added information with regard to nitrous oxide to the website drugs.ie.</p><p>The Garda National Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau has communicated with the relevant State bodies with regard to its experience relating to the possession and use by particular persons of nitrous oxide. However, at present, nitrous oxide is not a controlled substance under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. </p><p>The purpose of the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 includes the prevention of the misuse of dangerous or otherwise harmful psychoactive substances and the provision of offences relating to the sale, importation, exportation or advertisement of those substances. For example, the Act provides that a person who sells, or who imports or exports, a psychoactive substance knowing or being reckless as to whether that substance is being acquired or supplied for human consumption shall be guilty of an offence.</p><p>With regard to children, section 74 of the Child Care Act 1991 also provides for the offence of sale etc. of solvents. It provides that it shall be an offence for a person to sell, offer or make available a substance to a person under the age of eighteen years or to a person acting on behalf of that person if he knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the substance is, or its fumes are, likely to be inhaled by the person under the age of eighteen years for the purpose of causing intoxication. The section criminalises the sale and supply of solvents rather than the inhalation or consumption of substances by persons under the age of 18.</p><p>I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that providing any provisional/operational figures in respect of arrests and seizures of nitrous oxide based on the data collected on PULSE is difficult due to the manner in which the information is recorded, and would require an inordinate amount of time and resources to compile. </p></reply>

The projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime or anti-social behaviour and to support wider preventative work within the community and with families at risk.</p>  <p>  There are currently 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects in place throughout the State supporting up to 4,000 young people.  Funding of approximately &euro;18 million is being provided by my Department in 2020.  This funding supports approximately 265 FTE youth justice workers, family support and early intervention posts, though it should be noted that this number can vary throughout the year for a variety of reasons, including leave, the inclusion of part time workers in the figure and project expansion. </p>  <p>  I understand that considerable progress has been made in the last two years to extend the Garda Youth Diversion Project network to ensure that the service is available throughout the State.  This has been achieved by extending the catchment areas of existing project and by allocating additional staff.  There are a very small number of areas where this approach would not be suitable and I understand these are instead being considered for the establishment of new projects.  I am informed that the number of areas in the State in which the evidence warrants the establishment of a new project, rather than the strengthening or extension of a catchment areas, is considerably less than 10. </p>  <p>  Catchment areas for projects are determined in consultation with local community groups, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other stakeholders on a case-by-case basis.  As the GYDPs have evolved organically since their inception, catchment areas can vary depending on the project&rsquo;s background and local needs.  </p>  <p>  It may also be noted that, in recent years, the GYDP model has been developed and extended, with a renewed emphasis on family support and early intervention/preventative work, as well as on working with harder-to-engage young people, including those not suitable for the Garda Diversion Programme.  Where any new projects are being established, the minimum core of the project will now include 2 youth justice workers, a family support worker, an early intervention support worker and an outreach worker to engage with harder-to-reach young people. </p>  <p>  The estimated cost in a full year for a new project with all the additional elements under this draft revised model will depend on local circumstances.  For comparison, funding of existing projects is some &euro;125,000 on average. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has published a draft of a new Youth Justice Strategy in tandem with an online consultation which was completed recently.  It is my intention that the draft Strategy will be further refined, informed by the outcome of the public consultation and the views of key stakeholders, with a view to presenting the finalised version to Government by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The Central Hostel in Miltown Malbay is one of those premises contracted on an emergency basis.  </p>  <p>  As it is not contracted as a Direct Provision Centre, the inspection regime that exists within my Department does not apply to this premises.  This is because the inspection regime is designed to monitor compliance against contractual obligations that Direct Provision service providers must meet.  Our stated aim is to reduce the reliance on such emergency accommodation but given existing demand, that can only be achieved through increasing the number of dedicated Direct Provision bed spaces.  It has not been possible to open additional new centres during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  IPAS officials have visited the premises in Miltown Malbay and have spoken with residents via online clinics.  They were satisfied that the premises is clean, safe and meeting the needs of residents.  In addition, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) visited the premises in February 2020 as part of a wider tour of such accommodation premises and did not raise any concerns with my Department.</p>  <p>  In general, and based on public health advice, transfers between centres are currently suspended at this time, unless there are urgent medical needs or for the safety and security of residents.  </p>  <p>  The concerns raised by residents in The Central Hostel, Miltown Malbay will be fully investigated by my officials as a matter of priority to assess how best they can be addressed.

Probate functions are also carried out by County Registrars at District Probate Registries in 14 provincial court offices.  </p><p>However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided the following information to me. </p><p>Personal Applications in Dublin have been on hold since the restrictions imposed on foot of the Covid 19 pandemic began.  The Dublin Probate Office is currently looking at the health and safety implications and logistical issues associated with resuming the face-to-face interview service with members of the public.  In the meantime, the Dublin Probate Office is continuing to accept and process applications received by post, as it has done over the past five months.</p><p>Prior to Covid 19, the waiting time had reduced to twelve weeks for personal applications.  The waiting time for solicitor applications is currently around three weeks. </p><p>Waiting times in the various District Court registries are outlined below: <table>    <tr>       <th>District Probate Offices</th>       <th>Applications from solicitors - Average time from first receipt to issue a grant of Probate/letters of administration </th>       <th>Applications from Personal Applicants - Average time from first receipt to issue a grant of Probate/letters of administration</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>1 week</td>       <td>2-3 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>2-3 weeks</td>       <td>up to date</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>12 weeks</td>       <td>18 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>12-14 weeks</td>       <td>36 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>16 weeks</td>       <td>20 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>4 weeks</td>       <td>4 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Castlebar</td>       <td>6-8 weeks</td>       <td>6-8 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clonmel</td>       <td>3 weeks</td>       <td>3 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>4 weeks</td>       <td>8 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dundalk</td>       <td>4 weeks</td>       <td>6 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mullingar</td>       <td>5 weeks</td>       <td>3 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>9-10 weeks</td>       <td>10-12 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tralee</td>       <td>4 weeks</td>       <td>4 weeks</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Letterkenny</td>       <td>4-6 weeks</td>       <td>4-6 weeks</td>    </tr> </table> The Courts Service does not keep data on the longest waiting time of individual applications as any lengthy waiting times are normally due to the solicitor or applicant not answering queries raised.</p><p>The Courts Service has made a decision not to proceed with the e-Probate project at this time due to budgetary constraints.  There is a project ongoing to remove the manual Revenue Affidavit from the probate process and to replace the manual process with an online system.  The go live date for this changeover is September of this year.  This should reduce further the waiting times for all applications. </p><p>The Review of the Probate process is now complete.  All actions which assisted in the lowering of the waiting times have been taken.  The reduction in waiting times for solicitor applications reflects the outcome of the Review and the outcomes from other initiatives that have taken place over the past two years.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that 3 prisoner transport vehicles were allocated to the Garda Fleet in 2019, and a further 2 prisoner transport vehicles were allocated to the Garda Fleet in 2020.</p>  <p>  I am advised that there are currently 16 Prisoner Transport Vehicles attached to the Garda Fleet.  These are vehicles specifically designed for Prisoner Transport with a minimum capacity for 4 prisoners in individual cells dependent on the vehicle. This does not include the 106 Marked Ford Transit Vans which are allocated to Patrol Duties, each having two individual cells.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that there are no plans to purchase additional prisoner transport vehicles this year and that the operational need for all vehicle types will be considered in the context of the 2021 budgetary process. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 30 June 2020, there were 2,961 vehicles attached to the Garda Fleet, including vehicles attached to the national units.  For clarity, this figure does not include the additional 210 vehicles which have been hired by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year, to provide additional capacity during the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Significant capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a total of &euro;46 million specifically for the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021. This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  </p>  <p>  Of this investment, a total of &euro;9 million was made available for purchase and fit-out of additional Garda vehicles in 2020.  I am also informed that in order to protect the ongoing availability of vehicles and in anticipation of the impact of public health restrictions on motor factory or fit-out workplaces, 94 additional vehicles were purchased by the Garda authorities in March 2020 at a cost of &euro;2.4m and fit-out costs of &euro;600,000.  The allocation of these and all other vehicles in the fleet is entirely a matter for the Commissioner and his management team.  </p></reply>

Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated. </p><p>The Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 - 2016 provide the legal framework underpinning the Bureau's powers to take all necessary actions, including the making of applications to the High Court, in relation to the seizing and securing of assets with a view to their disposal in due course in accordance with the provisions of that legislation. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that all funds collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in the course of its activities are returned to the Exchequer for the benefit of the Central Fund, in accordance with the relevant legislation. </p><p>The sale / disposal of all assets are dealt with on a case by case basis and in accordance with the Order(s) of the High Court.  These Orders can specify the method / type of sale required, approval and/or other stipulations as the Court views appropriate in each case. Therefore, it is not possible for the Criminal Assets Bureau to provide definitive times or locations of sales of seized items.</p><p>The method of sale is also dependent upon the assets type/category and whether that asset is being sold by a court appointed receiver or pursuant to a vesting order. When deciding the method of sale/disposal, consideration is given to the type of asset, the advices of experts (e.g. auctioneers in the case of houses, horologists in the case of watches, etc.), the source of that asset and any risk factors that may be involved or associated to or with that asset. As previously stated, the method of sale/disposal is also subject to the order of the High Court.</p><p>The options available in the sale/disposal of real property (houses/land) are;</p><p>- Direct sale to local authority/housing agency (after independent inspection, valuation and advice)</p><p>- Sale by private treaty</p><p>- Sale by public auction</p><p>The options available in the case of vehicles are;</p><p>- Sale by public auction</p><p>- Use and employment of independent broker</p><p>The options available in the case of movable assets (e.g. watches, jewellery, designer goods) are;</p><p>- Sale by public auction</p><p>- Use and employment of independent broker.</p><p>The Criminal Assets Bureau, under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996-2016, has frozen assets to the value of &euro;231,918,179, GBP &pound;21,864,840 and USD $12,935,685 under Section 2 and Section 3 for the years 1996 &ndash; 2019.</p><p>The investigations conducted by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the consequential proceedings and actions resulted in &euro;194,518,433.05 returned to the Exchequer as a whole for the years 1996 &ndash; 2019, a breakdown of which is below:</p><p>Proceeds of Crime legislation: &euro;  30,519,179</p><p>Revenue legislation:&euro;159,284,028</p><p>Social Welfare legislation:&euro;4,715,226</p><p><b>Total Returned to Exchequer:&euro;194,518,433</b></p></reply>

This consultation has been carried out to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field, so that the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective in dealing with unacceptable incidents. </p>  <p>  There has been strong engagement by the public with this topic. The Department has received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including approximately 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department has carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.  This research is currently being finalised and is expected to be published shortly. </p>  <p>  My officials are analysing all of these materials, as well as other relevant legal and policy information, to ensure that any legislative proposals which are made are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting freedom of expression. </p>  <p>  There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the approach being taken - including research and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views through consultation - will help to ensure that the legislation we develop will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, now as well as into the future.</p></reply>

Westmeath County Council fulfilled its allocation for the resettlement of refugee families in April 2019 and no further housing allocation is expected. The Westmeath Refugee Resettlement Programme had already been extended by an additional seven months to facilitate further integration supports to recently arrived families.  It was not possible, therefore, for the person concerned and his immediate family to be allocated housing in Mullingar, as was desired.</p>  <p>  The family concerned was initially allocated housing in County Wicklow. However, the Integration Service Delivery Unit of my Department subsequently secured alternative accommodation in Clara, Co. Offaly, with the assistance of Offaly County Council, to enable them to be closer to their extended family in Mullingar. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is not possible for my Department to secure housing for families in particular locations as the allocation of housing is matter for the Local Authorities. Families are of course free to source their own housing throughout the country and are entitled to the same supports as all other citizens including the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.</p></reply>

While the wearing of PPE in the Probation Service is not mandatory at present, this is an evolving situation (and subject to the advice of relevant health experts).  </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is playing a key role in supporting the public health guidelines and restrictions which are in place to prevent or reduce spread of the Covid-19 virus. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner is by law responsible for the administration and management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the distribution of resources and deployment of equipment.

The Bill is due to expire on the 9th of November 2020, unless a resolution approving its continuation is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Throughout the period in which this legislation has been enacted, the Government has been immensely conscious of the sacrifices which have been made by people across the country as a result of the restrictions on their movement that have been imposed in recent months. We have endeavoured to remove those restrictions in line with the progression of the disease, and fortunately have been in a position to unwind many of them at this point. However, the continued detection of Covid-19 in the community indicates that there remains a threat of a resurgence of the virus and hence, certain measures have been kept in place for the present. They are under constant review and will of course be removed as soon as it is safe to do so.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>   To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand. </p>  <p>   Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p><p>The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p><p>Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().</p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. In addition, the HSE published 'A Safe Return to Health Services' last week, which is a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. </p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the deputy concerning the need to provide additional orthopaedic capacity to reduce waiting times for patients from Co Cavan and Co Monaghan, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the issue and provide you with a direct response. </p></reply>

The cost includes critical care and ward beds but they are not separately identifiable. The fully absorbed cost, includes treatment and care costs (such as diagnostics and theatres) as well as the running costs such as heating, lighting and servicing equipment, but excludes capital and depreciation. In addition, this figure does not include other associated hospital costs such as day-case, outpatient and emergency department costs. </p>  <p>  In relation to capital expenditure, several factors determine the capital cost of a hospital bed. These include the nature of the bed (day case, in-patient/overnight, intensive/critical care, etc.), and the bed&rsquo;s location (within an existing hospital, within a new extension to an existing hospital or through the development of a new hospital). As such, there is no one capital cost for providing an additional hospital bed.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's specific question on the estimated cost and capital cost of acute hospital beds, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

This must be integrated across the care pathway and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres, where necessary.</p><p>The framework will guide the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level, through a 10-step Framework.</p><p>It proposes the formation of Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Networks (MCRNs), with the set-up of one demonstration MCRN suggested as the first step. </p><p>The ultimate goal of this approach is to put in place a national framework of acute, inpatient and specialist community services.</p><p>The Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network (MCRN) model acknowledges that different service users need different input and different levels of expertise and specialisation at different stages in their rehabilitation journey.</p><p>The critical point of this model is that, although service users may need to access different services as they progress, the transition between services should be facilitated by appropriate communication and sharing of information between services so that they progress in a seamless continuum of care through the different stages:</p><p>- Acute hospital; </p><p>- Complex specialist rehabilitation services; </p><p>- Post-acute specialist inpatient rehabilitation services;</p><p>- Community based specialist rehabilitation services;</p><p>- Primary care; and </p><p>- Voluntary organisations.</p><p>This National Implementation Framework is evidence-based and informed by population needs. It addresses the continuum of care for those in need of neurological rehabilitation services. It describes the requirement for a whole system approach and provides the blueprint for how we should deliver care and services for those who suffer from neurological conditions who require individualised, goal focused rehabilitation</p><p>The implementation framework covers an initial period from 2019 into 2021. However, it is recognised that continued investment in and development of neuro-rehabilitation services will need to be prioritised beyond the three-year implementation period of this Implementation Framework. </p><p>As the question is a service related matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Needs and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness or a disability and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. The Expert Group also concluded that a persons means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  In relation to the cost of providing a permanent medical card to people with disabilities regardless of their work status, the data required to model this is not readily available and it is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the cost of the proposal.  </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that since 1st December 2018, the medical card earnings disregard for persons in receipt of Disability Allowance was increased from &euro;120 to &euro;427 per week and applies to the assessment process for both single persons and to family assessments. This measure gave effect to one of the key recommendations of the Make Work Pay for Persons with Disabilities Report. </p></reply>

The priority to-date has been on the purchase of houses in the community and the adaptation of these houses to suit the requirements of the new residents. This will continue in 2020 with an added goal of working closer with Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to avail of other Government funding through the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS). </p>  <p>  To-date 85 houses in the community have been provided through this programme and 300 residents have been relocated from congregated settings.

The impacts of COVID-19 and the new recommendations on distance requirements are yet to be determined but could significantly increase the overall costs of beds while revising down the numbers of beds that can safely occupy any given location.</p>  <p>  A pre-Covid review of acute hospital beds being constructed or following completion determined an average capital cost per bed of &euro;375,000, including some enabling costs.  ICU/HDU beds can cost up to &euro;1million per bed. These figures are drawn from an HSE Estates survey of active and recently completed projects. They do not represent a universal capital cost for hospital beds.</p>  <p>  Larger projects will require additional developments and equipment needs on acute hospital sites (e.g. the installation of bigger kitchens, OPD, utility enhancements, relocation of services, etc.) which would incur further additional costs.</p></reply>

An annual expenditure of &euro;96.72 can therefore be estimated. </p>  <p>  Data from the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service indicates that the number of women and girls aged 12-54 in receipt of a GP visit card is 54,800. The estimated cost of free period products for this group, using the CSO figures above, is &euro;5.3m approximately. A similar estimate for the 389,150 women aged 12-54 with a GMS (medical) card is &euro;37.6m per annum approximately. </p>  <p>  Data from the 2016 Census shows the population of women aged between 12 and 18 resident in Ireland is 213,129. Therefore, it can be estimated that the provision of free period products for this group would cost &euro;20.6m. Updated figures based on 2019 population estimates give 222,390 girls aged between 12-18, the corresponding estimated cost is &euro;21.5m. </p>  <p>  The most recent report from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (May 2020) concerning the numbers of people accessing local authority managed emergency accommodation, lists 2,221 female adults as homeless, the majority of whom would be of menstrual age (54 or under). Figures are also given for dependent children under the age of 18 who are also accessing homeless services (2787); assuming that age and gender distributions are even, one can estimate that 465 of these dependents are girls between 12 and 18. The estimated cost of free period products for this group is approximately &euro;260,000 per annum. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Homeless Period Ireland have advised the NSWG Sub-Committee on Period Poverty that they currently supply donated period products to homeless shelters, addiction services, charities and other organisations on request. As their business model relies on redistribution of donated products and not money, the current cost of their services to homeless shelters cannot be estimated accurately.</p>  <p>  Surveys and the scientific literature estimate that the majority of teenage girls require pain relief to manage their periods. The cost of this is not included in the CSO estimates above, but was included in estimates published by Plan International and on the Oireachtas website previously.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter and provide you with a direct response. </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>   The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>  The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>   The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019.  Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

Sl&aacute;intecare, underpinned by these principles for reform has also identified waiting list management as a key priority.  </p>  <p>   Physiotherapists, as part of the MDT with expert knowledge of rehabilitation and injury management can make a positive contribution towards improving waiting times for some patients. It is documented that there are selected caseloads of patients particularly in the area of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders that have gained more timely access to care where clinical teams include specialist or Advanced Practice Physiotherapists. There is also evidence that re referral rates are low and comparable to International rates avoiding system over burden. Longitudinal research of patient outcomes is required in the Irish context to determine the appropriateness of care delivered by Advanced Practice.</p>  <p>  Physiotherapists and the impact on waiting lists.  </p>  <p>   Advanced Practice Physiotherapist in Ireland is a role title rather than a regulated professional role which is governed by legislation. In other professions legislation protects the title of Advanced Practitioner and requires certain extended standards of practice.  In physiotherapy, such  legislative changes would require definition of the role from the professional perspective and the development of appropriate standards and an education programme to support the change in the level of practice.</p>  <p>  Registered Advanced Practitioners are well established in the Nursing and Midwifery professions for example. Advanced Practice in these professions developed over a number of years and followed a recommendation from the Commission on Nursing (1998). The basis of advanced practice is the high degree of knowledge, skill and experience that is applied within the nurse-patient/client relationship to achieve optimal outcomes through critical analysis, problem solving and accurate decision making. The outer limits to advanced practice are set by legislation, policy and guidelines that were developed through an extensive process.</p></reply>

The HRB has an annual budget of approximately &euro;40 million per year and as this is public money, there is an onus on the HRB to ensure the highest levels of governance and accountability for the management of its investments, both through its own code of governance and through its oversight and evaluation of those in receipt of this money. </p>  <p>  Any research-performing organisation on the island of Ireland can apply to become a host organisation to receive and manage HRB grants. There are no exclusions or restrictions to who may apply. To be approved as a host institution however, one must  be able to demonstrate a capability to manage heath related research, demonstrate financial soundness and warrant that it can comply with the HRB&rsquo; General Terms and Conditions. Public confidence in research, built on internationally recognised standards of good practice is vital. The public has a right to expect high scientific, ethical and financial standards, transparent decision ­making processes, clear allocation of responsibilities and robust monitoring arrangements. </p>  <p>  As well as sound financial management of research funds, and an appropriate environment to employ and support research staff, it is the responsibility of organisations providing health and social care in Ireland to be aware of all research undertaken in their organisation, or involving participants, bio-specimens or data obtained through that organisation.</p>  <p>  HSE Corporate or HSE hospitals are not on the list of HRB host institutions at this juncture because they have not yet demonstrated that they have the capacity to manage or account for research funding and are currently unable to meet the regulations and standards required for good research governance. As such the HRB is unable to contract with the HSE directly (although HSE employees are co-applicants and collaborators on many HRB grants, managed largely by academic partner organisations). It is not an anomaly, therefore - it is a necessary decision to safeguard public money.</p>  <p>  It is important that this situation  changes, however, especially if we are to realise our ambition to foster a culture of research and innovation in the healthcare system. As such, officials in my Department have focused on this issue as a priority in recent years and this resulted in the establishment of an R&amp;D Unit (headed by an Assistant National Director) in the HSE,  followed by the publication in late 2019 of the first ever HSE Research Strategy. A high priority outlined during 2019 and 2020 by my Department, and therefore a key priority in the HSE Research Strategy, was the development a Research Governance Framework for the HSE, to be adopted in the first instance by research-active hospitals. This will ensure that the research capabilities in our healthcare system can be fully harnessed and will ensure that funding, staff and collaborations can be secured, effectively managed and maintained, with healthcare organisations playing a leadership role. </p>  <p>  Work has advanced significantly on a HSE Research Governance Framework and discussions and related planning are ongoing with HSE hospitals and hospital groups with a view to adopting same. This foundational work led by the HSE, rather than any dilution of the standards of good governance by the HRB as a funder, will be the platform upon which a sustainable culture of high quality and trusted research and innovation is built in our healthcare system.</p></reply>

Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and to wash hands before putting them on and taking them off.</p><p>Guidance issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre defines a close contact as:</p><p>- Any individual who has had greater than 15 minutes face-to-face (&amp;lt;2 meters distance) contact with a case, in any setting. (A distance of 1 metre is generally regarded as sufficient to minimize direct exposure to droplets however, for Public Health purposes, a close contact definition of 2 metres has been specified). </p><p>- Household contacts defined as living or sleeping in the same home, individuals in shared accommodation sharing kitchen or bathroom facilities and sexual partners.  </p><p>- Healthcare workers, including laboratory workers, who have not worn appropriate PPE or had a breach in PPE during the following exposures to the case:  </p><p>- Direct contact with the case (as defined above), their body fluids or their laboratory specimen </p><p>- Present in the same room when an aerosol generating procedure is undertaken on thecase</p><p>- Passengers on an aircraft sitting within two seats (in any direction) of the case, travel companions or persons providing care, and crew members serving in the section of the aircraft where the index case was seated. (If severity of symptoms or movement of the case indicate more extensive exposure, passengers seated in the entire section or all passengers on the aircraft may be considered close contacts).</p><p>- For those contacts who have shared a closed space with a case for longer than two hours, a risk assessment should be undertaken taking into consideration the size of the room,  ventilation and the distance from the case. This may include office and school settings and any sort of large conveyance.</p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings, masks and shields is constantly evolving.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals were treated as public patients and their treatment was prioritised based on clinical need. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by the HSE that as of July 3, 12,959 patients had been discharged from private hospitals having undergone an inpatient procedure between April and June 2020. In the same period 53,609 day case procedures took place in private hospitals, as well as 85,658 diagnostic appointments and 52,096 outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  In relation to the more detailed breakdown requested concerning the activity levels per month at each of the 18 private hospitals which were part of the agreement with the HSE, and the associated costs, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The Bill is due to expire on the 9th of November 2020, unless a resolution approving its continuation is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Throughout the period in which this legislation has been enacted, the Government has been immensely conscious of the sacrifices which have been made by people across the country as a result of the restrictions on their movement that have been imposed in recent months. We have endeavoured to remove those restrictions in line with the progression of the disease, and fortunately have been in a position to unwind many of them at this point. However, the continued detection of Covid-19 in the community indicates that there remains a threat of a resurgence of the virus and hence, certain measures have been kept in place for the present. They are under constant review and will of course be removed as soon as it is safe to do so.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  -  Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; </p>  <p>  -  Bed and board;</p>  <p>  -  Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and</p>  <p>  -  Laundry service.</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme. </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.</p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider.</p>  <p>  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>  HIQA in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing homes meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  During the response to COVID-19, nursing homes continue to be regulated by HIQA, who under the Health Act 2007 have the legal authority to examine the operation of any facility under their remit. In relation to this particular nursing home, I have been advised that prior to my appointment the Department received correspondence in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy and forwarded on details to HIQA as the statutory regulator for nursing homes, and the HSE for appropriate action and follow up. </p></reply>

Since then, HSE Disability Services have been working to develop national guidance on the part of the disability sector to direct how all day services can be delivered. The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 8 July 2020. </p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link.  </p>  <p>  An information portal that will contain the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations will reopen around the country is being developed. After August 4th service users and families will be able to access this information on  www.hse.ie/newdirections.</p></reply>

The 1,000 respondents to the survey are not a representative sample of all festival attendees in Ireland. The survey contained a question regarding nitrous oxide. </p>  <p>  The HSE has stated that a report on the survey will be submitted to a peer reviewed journal for publication. This process may take some time and at this point a publication date for the full article cannot be provided. </p>  <p>  Important elements of the survey will be included in the report of the Working Group on Emerging Trends which will be released in the fourth quarter of this year, </p>  <p>  The HSE is gathering evidence on the use of nitrous oxide nationally through HSE Addiction Managers and Drug and Alcohol Task Forces. The HSE is also in contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, hospitals, and have contacted the National Poisons Information Centre in this regard. </p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to review these sources in August and September to identify if harms are emerging or if young people are presenting for treatment with problems associated with nitrous oxide. The information obtained and the evidence gathered will inform an appropriate response that may include a range of strategies to increase the awareness of the harms associated with drug use among young people. It must be noted that, to date, there have been no presentations to HSE Adolescent Addiction services for treatment specifically in relation to nitrous oxide. </p>  <p>Nitrous oxide falls under the definition of a psychoactive substance and a solvent. Section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances Act) 2010 states that a   person who sells a psychoactive substance knowing or being reckless as to whether that substance is being acquired or supplied for human consumption shall be guilty of an offence. </p>  <p>Section 74 of the Child Care Act 1991 states that   it shall be an offence for a person to sell, offer or make available a substance to a person under the age of eighteen years or to a person acting on behalf of that person if he knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the substance is, or its fumes are, likely to be inhaled by the person under the age of eighteen years for the purpose of causing intoxication.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for these Acts lays with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, respectively. </p>  <p>  Data from 2004 to 2017, which is the latest year for which data is available for dissemination from the National Drug Related Deaths Index, records no poisoning deaths as a specific result of nitrous oxide intake. The Index is based on four data sources (Coronial files, CTL, HIPE and CSO). Any  deaths that may be due to nitrous oxide in 2020 will be reported in due course.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of recent media reports regarding the increased use of nitrous oxide during the lockdown period, which is of grave concern to me. Particular vigilance is required to protect young people from threats to their health and well-being from misuse of substances, including nitrous oxide. The Government is committed to continuing to resource harm reduction and education campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the risks of drug use.  </p></reply>

Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and to wash hands before putting them on and taking them off. </p><p>On the 15th June, the Government and the National Transport Authority launched a national communications campaign  which outlines best practice for the use of face coverings in retail outlets, on public transport and in other public locations in which it is difficult to maintain social distancing or where this distance cannot be guaranteed, and are communicating to the public about:</p><p>-  who should wear face coverings</p><p>-  in what settings, and how to wear and remove face coverings correctly.</p><p>Guidance on how to make and safely use face coverings is available on gov.ie/face coverings and the HSE website. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, on Friday 10 July 2020, having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, I signed the Health Act (Covid-19)(Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020. The regulations provide that, from 13 July 2020, members of the public shall not, without reasonable excuse, travel by public transport without wearing a face covering. </p><p>Reasonable excuse includes where a person:</p><p>-  cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress</p><p>-  needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating</p><p>-  removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person</p><p>-  removes the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury</p><p>-  removes the face covering to take medication</p><p>The Regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13 years. </p><p>The Government has now also agreed to the mandatory wearing of face coverings in retail outlets, shops and shopping centres. Retail staff will also be obliged to wear a face covering unless there is a partition between them and members of the public or where there is a distance of 2 metres between them and members of the public. </p><p>In certain circumstances, for example, in situations where facial expressions are essential such as working with those with hearing loss and lip reading is required or for people who have other medical conditions, face shields may be a preferred option.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals were to be treated as public patients for the duration of the agreement and their treatment prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised in your correspondence, the HSE has advised that a patient who is in need of ongoing treatment should contact their Consultant, who is familiar with their circumstances and can best advise them on the process. </p></reply>

The form may be used to assist with contact tracing in the event there is a suspected or confirmed case on board a flight or ferry.</p>  <p>   A Green List of locations with similar or better epidemiological situations to Ireland&rsquo;s has been published. The Green List ensures that appropriate public health measures are applied to international arrivals based on the country they have travelled from. Persons arriving from these countries will not be advised to restrict their movements on arrival into Ireland. Government travel advice countries on the Green List is to take Normal Precautions.  The list will be reviewed every 2 weeks. If the epidemiological situation in a country deteriorates, that country will be removed from the list.</p>  <p>  Passengers arriving to Ireland from non-&lsquo;Green List&rsquo; countries are advised in the interest of public health to restrict their movements for 14 days. Restricted movement means staying at home and avoiding contact with other people and social situations as much as possible.</p>  <p>  Close consideration is being given by Government to policy in relation to overseas travel, including to additional measures being put in place at airports and ports to strengthen existing arrangements. The next steps include an electronic the Passenger Locator Form, which is currently being developed and an increased public health presence and communications at our points of entry.</p></reply>

Consequently, it will not be necessary to establish whether a mental health difficulty is &lsquo;primary&rsquo; for an individual to access the support of a mental health team. A shared case management approach may be required for particularly complex patients.</p>  <p>  On this basis, the policy recommends that a tiered model of integrated service provision for individuals with a dual diagnosis (e.g. substance misuse with mental illness) be developed to ensure that pathways to care are clear.</p>  <p>  With regards to service provision by NGOs, the policy recognises that the voluntary and community sector organisations are key partners in the design and development of HSE mental health services at national and local level, as well as referral partners for primary mental healthcare. Their services extend to therapeutic and other recovery supports for individuals and families, carers and supporters and can, therefore, help to reduce the use of inappropriate referrals to specialist mental health services. </p>  <p>  The policy recommends that where Voluntary and Community sector organisations are providing services aligned to the outcomes in this policy, operational governance and funding models should be secure and sustainable. In addition, the policy also contains recommendations to ensure more integrated linkages between HSE mental health services and the Voluntary and Community sector.</p>  <p>  I have agreed to meet a number of mental health groups in Tipperary in August.

The National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has provided assurance that the midwifery and obstetrical community are acutely aware of the important support provided by partners or companions and that they wish to facilitate this as far as possible.</p>  <p>  However, in the context of the current public health emergency, each of our 19 maternity units/hospitals are facing significant challenges. Such challenges may vary considerably between units and, indeed, over time as the situation evolves. In that context, and in line with clinical advice issued by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, an individual unit or hospital may, under certain circumstances, be forced to restrict access of partners to outpatients appointments, maternity wards and delivery theatres. It is important to remember that these restrictions are put in place to minimise the risk of spread of Covid-19 in the community and to protect hospital staff and patients as much as possible.</p>  <p>  Decisions on any restrictions in maternity hospitals are made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level and, while very regrettable, are necessary to protect the safety of patients, the wellbeing of staff and the operability of our maternity services. However, I can assure the Deputy that, in the context of what is a rapidly evolving situation, all restrictions will be frequently reviewed and reversed as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  With regards to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to you directly.</p></reply>

At this time, walk-in clinics are not generally being provided and patients are asked to phone their GP initially to discuss their medical problem. GPs are performing assessments over the phone to determine if a patient needs to attend the surgery. Many problems can be resolved over the phone or by video consultation, some can be helped by the electronic transfer of a prescription to the pharmacist while others may need referral to other services.  Where clinically indicated, the GP will arrange an appointment to see the patient in the surgery.  These measures are necessary to ensure the safety of patients, GPs, and practice staff.</p>  <p>  A joint Department of Health-HSE Community Capacity Working Group was established to oversee the work required in order to facilitate service restoration in the Primary and Community Sector. </p>  <p>  This group&rsquo;s work is aligned with, and has informed the HSE&rsquo;s development and publication of, the strategic framework for service delivery entitled &ldquo;Service Continuity in a COVID Environment&rdquo; which outlines the basis for a consistent approach to decision making regarding the resumption of full service delivery, and also sets out the parameters for the more detailed operational planning which is currently taking place across the primary and community sector at local level. </p>  <p>  These local plans will address any actions necessary to allow for the safe resumption of services and will outline the costs of preparations for any resumption of services. They will also describe the level of service to be provided and the expected timelines for activity to resume. These local plans will be submitted centrally to provide a single overview of implementation plans and activity levels. </p>  <p>  Alongside these planning exercises, an increasing amount of Primary and Community services that were paused or scaled back due to the Covid-19 pandemic are now resuming locally, with priority service areas such as the Child Development Programme, the Chronic Disease Management programme, and various Health and Well-Being initiatives being amongst those in the first phase of resumption. Primary Care Therapeutic services are currently expected to resume fully over the Autumn period. It is important to note that some variation in service resumption across the Community Healthcare Organisations may be expected, depending on local capacity and the nature of service provision. </p></reply>

While the nature and scale of the Covid-19 pandemic has been unprecedented, the collection of timely and comprehensive data has underpinned the efforts of the public health response to Covid-19 and has been instrumental in developing the health service response to Covid-19 and to the advice provided by NPHET and the Department of Health to assist Government decision-making in the wider response to Covid-19 in Ireland.</p><p>Comprehensive national statistics, information and data about Covid-19, including a timeline of confirmed cases by date, is published on a daily basis on the Department of Health website at www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-health/ and on the Covid-19 Data Hub and Dashboards available at . Datasets, charts and maps are updated on an on-going basis and in line with newly published data. The published data are based on official figures provided by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>A daily Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Ireland report is published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) available at .

This is available on the CSO Covid-19 Information Hub at www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-covid19/covid-19informationhub/health/. This includes a range of data reporting on demographic information including age breakdowns, locations and other relevant information of those affected by Covid-19. It is not possible to report on specific symptoms such as anosmia at the point in time of a Covid-19 test being performed, as testing is primarily a laboratory diagnostic process rather than indicative of the symptoms that prompted a GP or other relevant health practitioner to refer a patient for a test. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the data published to date is made available in a timely and comprehensive manner to inform the Department and wider Government response but also to ensure the public are kept informed to the greatest extent possible. There is also ongoing collaboration between my Department, the HPSC, the HSE, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the CSO, Ordnance Survey Ireland and many other institutions and agencies to improve the data collected and the availability of it on an ongoing basis. I would like to assure the Deputy of my Department's ongoing commitment to publish as much Covid-19 data on an ongoing basis as is practicable, relevant and appropriate.</p></reply>

On Thursday 25 June the Government confirmed the move to Phase 3 of the Roadmap from Monday, 29 June 2020.

The Government has exempted places of worship from the regulations restricting numbers on mass gatherings. The exemption applies to places of worship only and not to any gatherings that may take place after the religious ceremony such as wedding receptions. </p><p>Detailed Covid-19 Guidance has been developed for religious services. The Cabinet Committee reviewed the guidance, which state that an assessment should be carried out for each premises to determine how many can attend within the requirements of social distancing.  </p><p>The Cabinet Committee decided that where the size of the premises allows for a capacity of greater than 50 this may be permitted only where:</p><p>-  Social distancing guidelines are adhered to </p><p>-  The premises can be subdivided into distinct sections (cordoned or marked appropriately) of not more than 50 persons in each section </p><p>-  There is a minimum of 4m between sections </p><p>-  Each section has its own entrance/exit route</p><p>-  There are separate arrangements for elements of the service involving close contact, e.g. the distribution of Holy Communion </p><p>-  Strictly no movement of people between sections before, during or after the service</p><p>-  The premises is well-ventilated.</p><p>Account must also be taken regarding the risk of congregation by people outside before and after any services, having regard to outdoor overall limits on mass gatherings and arrangements for staggered exiting after ceremonies</p><p>The use of face coverings is strongly recommended for such indoor settings.</p></reply>

Hospitals have developed new ways of working and, guided by appropriate clinical and operational decision making, the patient's healthcare advice will depend on the type of hospital visit.</p><p>The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site at the following link .</p><p>In relation to testing, the HSE has developed guidance for the management of planned hospital admissions for non-COVID care which sets out advisory testing strategies for hospital patients, available at: www.rcsi.com/dublin/-/media/feature/media/download-document/dublin/covid-19-section/surgical-practice/other-national-clinical-programmes-and-recognised-bodies/ncagl-acute-operations-interim-guidance-on-the-management-of-planned-hospital-admission-for-non.pdf. This guidance seeks to provide an advisory framework for mitigating risks associated with the delivery of non-COVID care while COVID-19 continues to be prevalent, and testing provides one of a number of such mitigation measures. Other efforts that can be taken to reduce risk would include, for example, self-isolation for 2 weeks in advance of admission. These measures are discussed directly with patients who have a planned admission to hospital to ensure an appropriately tailored approach is adopted for each individual patient's circumstances. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter and provide you with a direct response.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-07-28a.2888.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020072800152#WRCCC02400"><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department is extremely cognisant of the impact which the emergence of Covid-19 has had on all members of the community, including those with physical disabilities. I note the concerns that have been raised in particular with regard to the public health guidance on social distancing and the challenge this presents for those who are blind or visually impaired.</p><p>As we continue to reopen the country safely, every step is being guided by our developing understanding of the disease and the related public health advice. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is constantly evolving. Public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuous review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and is published by my Department and available at www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-health, by the HSE available at www.hse.ie and by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), published at www.hpsc.ie/. </p><p>In recognition of the potential for Covid-19 to impact disproportionately on some members of the community, a Vulnerable Peoples Subgroup of the NPHET has also been established and it includes among its membership the Disability Federation of Ireland, so as to ensure the collective voice of the disability sector is appropriately represented. </p><p>To recall, the public health advice which applies to all of us is to: </p><p>-  wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty</p><p>-  practice good respiratory hygiene, that is, when coughing and sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue &ndash; discard tissue immediately into a closed bin and clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water</p><p>-  maintain physical distancing, that is, leave at least 2 metres (6 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever</p><p>-  avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth &ndash; if you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.</p><p>The most important action we can take to protect ourselves from Covid-19 is regular hand washing and good respiratory hygiene.</p><p>Furthermore, any individuals providing assistance to blind persons should be aware of the public health guidance, and should not provide guidance if they themselves are unwell or have been in recent contact with a case of Covid-19, and should wear face coverings if unable to maintain physical distancing.</p><p>In addition, the NPHET has provide advice relating to face coverings on an ongoing basis and advises the wearing of a non-medical face covering in a number of circumstances which include:</p><p>-  when on public transport</p><p>-  when in indoor public areas including retail outlets</p><p>-  by people visiting the homes of those who are cocooning</p><p>-  by people who are being visited in their homes by those who are cocooning</p><p>-  all visitors to residential care facilities and</p><p>-  in indoor work environments where it is difficult to maintain a two-metre distance. </p><p>Individual judgement or preference should be used to consider the wearing of face coverings in other environments. </p><p>Cloth face coverings are not recommended for children under the age of 13. This is because young children may not follow advice about wearing a mask correctly and avoiding touching it.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that the wearing of face coverings is an additional hygiene measure and should not take the place of good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and other personal protective public health measures. Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and to wash hands before putting them on and taking them off.</p><p>The latest public health advice on face coverings is available at the following links and is updated on a regular basis:</p><p>www.gov.ie/facecoverings.</p><p>.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, on Friday 10 July 2020, having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, I signed the Health Act (Covid-19)(Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020. The regulations provide that, from 13 July 2020, members of the public shall not, without reasonable excuse, travel by public transport without wearing a face covering. </p><p>Reasonable excuse includes where a person:</p><p>-  cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress</p><p>-  needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating</p><p>-  removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person</p><p>-  removes the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury</p><p>-  removes the face covering to take medication. </p><p>The Regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13 years. </p><p>In relation to the specific issues raised by the Deputy with regard to sighted guides, I have asked the HSE to to review existing guidance and supports to see if further guidance for blind persons is required in the context of Covid 19. I would also note that it is advisable that any individuals providing assistance to blind persons should also be aware of the public health guidance, and not attempt to provide support of this kind if they themselves are unwell or have been in recent contact with a case of Covid19, and should wear face coverings if unable to maintain physical distancing.</p></reply>

The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that it has received an application for the reimbursement of patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy.</p>  <p>  In January 2019, a full health technology assessment was commissioned by the HSE. This assessment was completed in February 2020 with the NCPE recommending that patisiran (Onpattro&reg;) is not considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.  </p>  <p>  The HTA report will be an important input into the decision making processes of the HSE. The HSE is currently reviewing the report received and has recently met with the applicant company to discuss this. </p>  <p>  Once negotiations between the HSE and the applicant company are complete, this application must then be formally considered by the HSE Drugs Group. The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The decision making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team. </p>  <p>  In general, the HSE's Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) does not provide access to drug therapies which are not provided (funded) by the public healthcare system in Ireland. However, I am advised by the HSE that in the case of treatments provided by the National Amyloidosis Centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London a patient can make an application to the TAS.  Each application is dealt with by the HSE on an individual basis and subject to independent medical advice.</p></reply>

This meant that people had to have trust in the app which in turn meant that privacy needed to be central to the design, development and operation of the app. The Irish Covid Tracker app does not share location data, IP address or IMIE data from users of the app. </p>  <p>  People do have the choice of entering general location information when using the symptom checker but this data is not linked to them as an individual. It is simply used to inform heat maps of the spread of the virus and to assist in the rapid identification of emerging clusters.</p>  <p>  The Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was published by the HSE on 26 June 2020, along with the source code and provides transparency in relation to what data is collected and how it is processed.</p>  <p>  All personal data that is processed by the COVID Tracker app is kept to an absolute minimum in order to preserve the privacy of users. Use of the app is voluntary and data that is provided to the health services is provided on the basis of consent and user preferences. The COVID Tracker app complies with European Commission recommendations and guidance in relation to Covid apps.</p>  <p>  All design decisions have been assessed carefully from a data protection point of view. This led to the  decision to switch from a centralised model to a more privacy preserving decentralised model during the development phase of the app. Decentralised apps do not store data centrally on HSE or Government servers. Instead, data is held on the users own smartphone.</p>  <p>  Observations and guidance from the DPC was also sought and factored into the final design of the Covid Tracker app.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p>  <p>  Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p>  <p>  Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site: (www2.hse.ie/services/hospital-service-disruptions/hospital-service-disruptions-covid19.html).</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. In addition, the HSE published 'A Safe Return to Health Services' last week, which is a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. </p>  <p>  As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the deputy concerning the breakdown of activity levels at Mallow General Hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the issue and provide you with a direct response. </p></reply>

This provides the details on the projected affordable staffing levels by health service for 2020 on an annual basis as funding of the HSE is on an annual basis. The detail by staff category is not included, as the model is underpinned by an affordability model, whereby there is flexibility within HSE service delivery to allocate staff based on need and affordability rather than a more rigid staff category approach. The information can be found in the HSE National Service Plan (page 118) at the following link: www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/national-service-plan-2020.pdf. It should be noted that those projections were developed prior to COVID- 19.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently undertaking a strategic workforce planning exercise in the context of the ongoing response to COVID-19 to determine the required workforce to year end, to meet the service requirements of COVID-19 service delivery (i.e. COVID-19 services that are required to continue and standing back up services that were paused due to the immediate response to COVID-19). This work is complex, given that the HSE are dealing with a novel virus, and requires an integrated approach across multiple workstreams.</p>  <p>  It remains difficult to quantify what the public health sectors workforce requirements will be going forward, as we are still in the process of managing the crisis.  The service requirements and available resources will determine the extent to which recruitment will take place going forward.</p>  <p>  Over the coming months, the health service will face normal staff attrition and staff redeployed will return to their previous positions to support the recommencement of non-COVID services.  However, it has become clear that the workforce must be enhanced to meet current and future demands with sufficient contingency and flexibility to respond to unexpected public health threats and demand surges.  A new strategic workforce plan is being developed to take account of such matters. This work is being progressed as a matter of priority by the Department of Health and HSE.</p></reply>

In particular, it has committed to supporting the CervicalCheck Screening Programme, and the colposcopy services as an important part of that programme.  This is something I fully support and my Department will work closely with the National Screening Service and the CervicalCheck Programme, in particular, to advance colposcopy services.</p>  <p>  In light of the unprecedented public health challenges posed by the COVID-19 global pandemic in March 2020, the National Screening Service&rsquo;s (NSS) four national screening programmes, including CervicalCheck, were paused in March 2020. It is important to note, however, that clinical staff continued to work within the programmes.</p>  <p>  This pause was for community testing (GPs and clinics) and not for patients already referred to or in the process of being managed within the colposcopy system.  These patients were still cared for as hospital resources allowed and all colposcopy units continued to operate with a reduced volume.</p>  <p>  CervicalCheck has a network of quality-assured colposcopy clinics for women requiring further investigation following a smear test. Colposcopy units prioritised their work in line with clinical need and staffing availability.  Samples taken from patients in a colposcopy clinic setting (including follow-up smear clinics) continued to be accepted by the CervicalCheck Screening Programme.</p>  <p>  In terms of investment in colposcopy services in particular, this is dealt with as part of the National Service Plan and the HSE will provide details of investment made in 2018, 2019 and 2020.  Funding for 2021 will be dealt with as part of the upcoming estimates process.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific data requested in relation to capacity available in colposcopy services, processing time for colposcopy results by hospital, the number of laboratories involved, numbers of women waiting for appointments, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The Tribunal is being set up to hear and determine claims in respect of CervicalCheck outside of the court process.</p>  <p>  As the key arrangements for the CervicalCheck Tribunal were in place including the premises, membership, staffing and rules and procedures, it was intended that the Tribunal would be established by the end of March 2020. However, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, in line with the public health measures being taken to control the outbreak of the virus it was decided to delay the establishment of the Tribunal.</p>  <p>  Ms. Justice Mary Irvine who was originally announced as the Tribunal&rsquo;s nominated Chairperson when the Government agreed to set up the Tribunal in December 2018, was appointed as President of the High Court on 18 June 2020 and therefore will no longer be in a position to carry out the role of Chairperson of the Tribunal. Separately, Mr. Justice Michael Peart who was nominated for appointment as an ordinary member of the Tribunal has informed the Government that he will not be taking up that post.</p>  <p>  The Act requires that the Tribunal shall consist of a chairperson and at least two ordinary members, accordingly it will not be possible to establish the Tribunal until suitable persons have been identified for appointment to the Tribunal upon establishment.</p>  <p>  I am engaged in the process of identifying suitable new members for appointment. Once this process is complete, and the newly nominated chairperson is satisfied with the arrangements in place, the Tribunal will be established as soon as possible thereafter, and its members will be formally appointed under the Act. The Tribunal will be in a position to begin receiving claims immediately upon establishment.</p>  <p>  Section 12 of the Act sets out the time limits for making a claim to the Tribunal, including that in general, time limits for eligibility are calculated from the date of the Tribunal&rsquo;s establishment and that claims must be lodged within 9 months of that date. However, it is not possible to set out a timeframe for the Tribunal to carry out its work as the length of time the Tribunal will be in operation for is dependent on a number of factors, including how many of the persons who are eligible to make a claim to the Tribunal ultimately do so.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan.</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter and provide the Deputy with a direct response.</p></reply>

The Review identified an immediate requirement for 1,290 beds to address overcrowding and to ensure hospitals operated at 85% occupancy in line with other OECD countries. Approximately 770 additional beds have been provided to date. The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country. In the context of the current COVID-19 Pandemic response, the HSE advised on 22 June 2020 that an additional 324 acute beds have opened since March, bringing the current total of acute beds in the system to 11,597 excluding critical care capacity. It should be noted that this is the total current bed capacity. However, beds are unavailable when they are temporarily closed for reasons such as infection control, maintenance/refurbishment, or staffing shortages.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE&rsquo;s Critical Care Programme Census from September 2019 reported that there were 255 adult critical care beds in public hospitals. At an early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, additional funding was provided to the HSE to increase the number of critical care beds. 42 critical care beds have been funded since March in addition to the baseline critical care capacity already identified in hospitals.</p>  <p>  In line with the HSE&rsquo;s Critical Care Major Surge Preparedness Planning Framework, surge plans for further capacity for each Hospital Group have been developed in order to create additional capacity if required.</p>  <p>  Finally, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) agreed to support the marginal costs of funding additional beds for three months to the end of March 2020 at a cost of &euro;5.8 million. The HSE confirmed 197 of those beds had opened as planned. A further extension of this agreement has been approved until the 31st December 2020 at an estimated cost of &euro;12 million.</p>  <p>  The future opening of additional acute bed capacity will be considered in the context of the Estimates discussions for the years concerned and on the priorities in the HSE's National Service Plans for those years.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the cost of retaining additional capacity, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

It consolidates new ways of working and builds on international experience.  The Framework outlines the approach taken to prioritise the reintroduction of services, which has informed the more detailed planning for individual service areas.  The Framework identified key risks to the introduction of services, including reduced capacity, funding, flexibility to increase/reduce services in a COVID environment, the impact on time-limited/time-critical illnesses and associated outcomes and new ways of working.  This Framework serves as a basis for a consistent approach to decision making regarding service delivery and sets the parameters for the more detailed operational planning across all care settings at local level that is currently being conducted.</p>  <p>  Arising from the above mentioned Framework, the HSE have recently launched  a roadmap for the restoration of services, &ldquo;A Safe Return to Health Services - Restoring health and social care services in a COVID environment&rdquo; (July 2020 &ndash; www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/newsfeatures/covid19-updates/a-safe-return-to-health-services.pdf  ).  This document outlines the phased re-introduction of services that were suspended or reduced as a result of COVID-19 and includes plans on COVID testing and screening, COVID and non-COVID pathways, a public information campaign, continuity planning and staffing considerations.  Services will be resumed in a three phased approach between now and February 2021.  The priority is to ensure that service users who require urgent, time-critical care can access the services they need.  These timelines are based on assumptions regarding virus transmission levels and are subject to change as the situation develops.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing within the HSE in regard to  the more detailed Winter Planning, and the development of a waiting list and resumption plans.</p>  <p>  I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly with the additional information, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

Work on MedLIS is progressing but has been impacted as a result of resources being redeployed in response to Covid.  The focus now is to deploy MEDLIS to Cavan General Hospital (and region) and use the learnings from that to inform subsequent deployments to other sites.</p>  <p>  Progress is also underway in relation to the implementation of the Individual Health Identifier across national systems.  The impact of not having national health identifies deployed across the Irish health system, including laboratories used for Covid testing became very apparent during the early weeks and months of the pandemic.  We expect this will lead to a renewed sense of urgency to accelerate this project as the health service adjusts to the new normal.</p>  <p>  To date the IHI has been seeded into eReferrals and a programme of work is underway to further deploy the IHI into GP practice management systems, iPMS Patient Administration System and a number of other national systems. </p>  <p>  In light of service continuity and operational requirements in the context of Covid, further consideration needs to be given to the systems and operational sites that now need to be prioritised for IHI deployment, with a focus on Covid related priorities.</p></reply>

Such challenges may vary considerably between units and, indeed, over time as the situation evolves.  In that context, and in line with clinical advice issued by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, an individual unit or hospital may, under certain circumstances, be forced to restrict access of partners to outpatients appointments, maternity wards and delivery theatres.  It is important to remember that these restrictions are put in place to minimise the risk of spread of Covid-19 in the community and to protect hospital staff and patients as much as possible.</p>  <p>  Decisions on any restrictions in maternity hospitals are made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level and, while very regrettable, are necessary to protect the safety of patients, the wellbeing of staff and the operability of our maternity services.  However, I can assure the Deputy that, in the context of what is a rapidly evolving situation, all restrictions will be frequently reviewed and reversed as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  With regard to the restrictions in place in Cork University Maternity Hospital, as this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to you directly. </p></reply>

However, employees are required to notify their employer of their intention to travel abroad. The Green List will be regularly reviewed and may change. As such, HSE employees should be aware that they will have to follow any restricted movement requirements that are in place on their date of return.</p></reply>

The model in the Irish context is relatively new and is built on a multidisciplinary approach to care delivery based on patient need. It is delivered through a combined clinical approach overseen by a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon and / or Advanced Nurse Practitioner with other clinical practitioners such as physiotherapists managing episodes of care.  The requirement for physiotherapists to order x-rays needs to be determined in the Irish context of the virtual model. If a requirement is established in the future then legislation changes supported by a professional position, development of relevant education and competency standards of practice will also be required.  </p></reply>
