    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-21a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100064#WRA00600"><p>The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.15 billion.  The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.  </p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1 March 2021 and by the deadline a record 3,106 applications were submitted. </p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p>  <p>  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>  Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received. The assessment of all appeals is complete and the consequent allocations amounting to &euro;6.14 million were announced on Tuesday 31 May.</p>  <p>  The total allocation of &euro;150 million for capital projects represents the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP.  </p>  <p>  While the Programme funds a broad range of projects it should be noted that the Programme does not fund the purchase of land or buildings. Full details of the Programme and the type of projects funded can be found at www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie</p>  <p>  A separate tax relief scheme for donations to sports clubs may be used by any sports club or organisations to assist in funding the acquisition of land or a building, developing facilities or purchasing fixed, non-personal equipment for sports activities, or repaying a loan for any of these purposes to fund the purchase of land. More information in this regard can be found at www.revenue.ie.  </p>  <p>  Currently all boxing clubs are entitled to apply directly for Sports Capital and Equipment funding up to a value of &euro;150,000 for local projects. In cases where a club does not own a premises, it is still permissible for that club to apply for capital grants up to a value of &euro;50,000 and I note the club in question has received SCEP funding previously for equipment under the 2018 round. The SCEP is also open to applications from local authorities however, and such applications may include proposals to develop sports facilities on behalf of local sports clubs. The latest round of the SCEP included an application from Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council to develop a new facility at the rear of an existing community facility which will primarily be used by the club referred to by the Deputy. The local authority sought &euro;150,000 towards the work and I was pleased that the allocations announced in February of this year included the full amount sought which is the maximum grant available for local projects under the SCEP. It is now a matter for the local authority to advance the works and my Department will ensure there is no undue delay from our perspective in advancing the proposal.  </p>  <p>  More generally, it should be noted that 49 boxing clubs received funding under the 2020 SCEP round which is indicative of our commitment to the sport. With regard to any future applications from the boxing club or the local authority a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP will commence shortly and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete.  </p>  <p>  In relation to current expenditure funding, Sport Ireland channels funding for boxing through the Irish Athletic Boxing Association (IABA) as the National Governing Body for boxing. It does not provide direct funding for clubs. In 2021, Sport Ireland allocated funding of almost &euro;1.5 million to the IABA across the Core Funding, High Performance, Women in Sport and Dormant Accounts Funding. A further &euro;1.2m was allocated to the IABA in Covid funding over the last two years to support the NGB and its clubs in meeting the challenges arising from Covid-19.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-21a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100064#WRA01000"><p>As the Deputy is aware, The 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and the accompanying Action Plan for the Irish Language (<b>Plean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta 2018-2022</b>) represent Government policy in relation to the Irish language and Gaeltacht regions.  </p><p>My Department is responsible inter alia, for coordinating its implementation which has cross-departmental ownership. Accordingly, responsibility for implementation falls on a number of Government Departments, bodies and Irish language and Gaeltacht organisations.  </p><p>The Action Plan and the two annual progress reports published to date, present a clear overview of the 180 or so actions being advanced by circa 60 stakeholders in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions. Undoubtedly, functioning in the shadow of the pandemic over the last two years has proved challenging and this is no less the case in terms of delivery of supports in the domain of Irish language and Gaeltacht affairs. </p><p>In terms of financial supports for the language insofar as my Department is concerned, an additional exchequer allocation of &euro;7m for language programmes plus &euro;4.2m extra for Irish language broadcasting was included in Budget 2022, further enabling support for the language and Gaeltacht regions  - particularly in the context of the ongoing implementation of the language planning process and the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, being spearheaded by the Department of Education. </p><p>This additional allocation ultimately means that total funding of over &euro;85m is being deployed by my Department in support of the Irish language and Gaeltacht regions in the current year. </p><p>A budget allocation of &euro;5.8m is being made available in 2022 to support the Language Planning Process.  This will enable my Department to fund both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge who are tasked under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 with supporting the  process.  It will also enable my Department to support, at a central level, organisations which operate in the domains of early years; family; and the traditional arts sectors as an additional support to the language planning process.  </p><p>As of April 2022, language plans in respect of all of the 26 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas have now been approved.</p><p>To date, language plans for five Gaeltacht Service Towns have been approved, namely, Leitir Ceanainn, Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, Cathair na Gaillimhe, An Cloch&aacute;n Liath and Tr&aacute; L&iacute;. Plans for Castlebar and Dungarvan are currently being examined by the Department while the preparation of plans is being advanced in the case of Cahersiveen and Cork City. Preparatory work is also in hand in the case of Clifden, Co. Galway and Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo.</p><p>3 Irish Language Networks have been approved under the process - Ennis, Loughrea and Clondalkin - as well as two others in the north - Carn T&oacute;char and Iarthar Bh&eacute;al Feirste - which have been approved by Foras na Gaeilge under a non-statutory process being overseen by the organisation. </p><p>26 Language Planning Officers (20 in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, 4 in Gaeltacht Service Towns and 2 in Irish Language Networks) and 4 Assistant Language Planning Officers are currently engaged in implementing approved plans.</p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 has recently been signed into law.  The primary purpose of the Act is to amend the Official Languages Act 2003 with a view to increasing and improving the provision of public services through the Irish language. The systematic implementation of the Act will serve to further indirectly benefit the language in Gaeltacht regions.</p><p>I am confident that these key measures will continue to support and develop greater use of the Irish language both within Gaeltacht regions and nationally.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-21a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022062100064#WRA01400"><p>While I have not had any direct engagement to date on this matter with the organisation mentioned by the Deputy, I am aware that the current levels of hotel accommodation availability and pricing could potentially impact on attendance at sporting events particularly in Dublin. </p>  <p>  As Minister Martin has already outlined, there is additional pressure on hotel capacity and pricing as we enter the peak summer months and the tourism industry recovers.</p>  <p>  Hotel supply in Dublin has been challenged and affected by a range of factors, some of them short-term. These include deferred business from the last two years and increased demand. Businesses are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors but it is important that Ireland maintains its reputation as a value for money destination. The Government provided strong support to the tourism and hospitality sector over the two years of the Covid pandemic, in the form of direct business continuity payments, wage subsidy schemes and, most recently, the extension of the reduced 9% VAT rate until the end of February 2023. Those supports have helped to sustain this vital economic sector. Significant funding support was also provided to sporting organisations in 2020 and 2021 to assist them in meeting the challenges of Covid. This funding was particularly important for those National Governing Bodies that depend on revenue from gate receipts and spectator attendance.    Since the restrictions on spectator attendance were lifted, spectators have returned to sporting events in great numbers. I hope that this will continue to be the case for upcoming events. </p>  <p>  We are entering into a period in which large numbers of people will be travelling to games across the country, it is important for the promotion of participation in sport that those who need to be able to access accommodation at a price point which provides them with value. Tourism officials within the Department will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This heralds a new approach to the way the State funds and recognises  artists and I look forward to seeing the data and findings of the research during the pilot.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the pilot scheme is a three-year research programme to examine the impact a basic income style payment could have on artists and creative arts workers and their creative practice. It will not be possible to provide funding to all eligible applicants under the scheme as it is a pilot programme.  The data and research gathered as part of the pilot will form the evidence base for any future basic income for the arts policy.</p><p>I must reiterate that eligibility for social welfare supports is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, I have been determined since the outset of the BIA pilot scheme that artists with disabilities would be in a position to participate to the greatest extent possible.  Accordingly, my Department has worked with the Department of Social Protection, to establish that the payment will be treated as earnings from self-employment and can be taken into account in earnings disregards that applies to many social welfare payments. That means that the basic income for the arts will be treated like any other income a person on social welfare earns from employment.  </p><p>The actual impact of the Basic Income on a person&rsquo;s welfare entitlements will depend on each individual&rsquo;s circumstances, successful applicants will need to engage with the Department of Social Protection on the matter before accepting the Basic Income payment.</p></reply>

The TLG was tasked with overseeing the formulation of an Action Plan to implement the policy goals set out in this document.  Once formed, the TLG developed two action plans over the period 2016-2021 to deliver the objectives in the policy statement. </p><p>In 2020, during the timeframe of the second Tourism Action Plan (2019-2021), the tourism landscape changed drastically. COVID-19 had a devastating impact on our tourism industry.</p><p>During this time, the Government provided supports for the sectors worst affected by the crisis, including tourism. A Tourism Recovery Taskforce was established in May 2020 and delivered a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector could adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment. Later that year, I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group to oversee the implementation of this plan. The Recovery Oversight Group is continuing its work and will continue to report with updates on implementation of the recovery plan and recovery in the sector more generally.</p><p>In 2019, a Sustainable Tourism Working Group under the aegis of my Department set out an ambition for sustainable tourism in Ireland as well as a number of guiding principles for sustainable tourism development. Late last year I brought a report to Government, developed by this Group, which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices out to 2023. </p><p>My Department has initiated the development of a new national tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability. Officials in the Department are currently preparing to undertake an initial consultation with key stakeholders. Following the completion of this initial informal consultation and a review of the previous policy (People Place and Policy 2025), a formal public consultation will take place with a view to publishing a new Sustainable Tourism Policy in 2023.  </p><p>This policy commitment will seek to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be among the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices, from not only an environmental but also a social and economic perspective.  </p></reply>

Tourism Ireland has a vital role to play in building the demand needed to restore access and connectivity to pre-pandemic levels, by working closely with air and sea carriers, airports and ferry ports, as well as other partners, to drive demand for new and existing air and sea services. Tourism Ireland consistently makes the case for the introduction of strategically important inbound services and welcomes proposals from air and sea carriers for the introduction of routes with inbound tourism potential. </p><p>Tourism Ireland promotes regional air and sea access to Ireland in overseas tourism markets through initiatives like the Regional Cooperative Marketing Fund. This initiative seeks to encourage new access opportunities and to maximise the potential of existing services to the regions, with matched funding from airlines, sea carriers, airports, ports and regional tourism stakeholders including Local Authorities.  </p><p>The Regional Cooperative Marketing Fund has been very important in enabling tactical partnerships that have helped drive increases in visitors to the regions, amplifying the tourism marketing message overseas and supporting direct access. This scheme will continue to form a very important part of Tourism Ireland's plans in supporting the recovery of our tourism sector in a post-pandemic environment.  </p><p>The allocation to Tourism Ireland in respect of the Regional Cooperative Marketing Fund for 2022 is &euro;3 million.  </p><p>This Spring, Tourism Ireland in France undertook a co-operative campaign with Brittany Ferries, to help drive demand among French holidaymakers for its Roscoff to Cork and its Cherbourg to Rosslare services and bookings for sailings for July 2022 are up 44% on July 2019.  </p><p>Tourism Ireland will run campaigns in France this Autumn with Irish Ferries to promote its Cherbourg to Dublin service, with Stena Line to promote its Cherbourg to Rosslare service and with DFDS to promote its Dunkirk to Rosslare service. </p><p>Tourism Ireland in Spain will also partner with Brittany Ferries this autumn, to highlight its Bilbao to Rosslare service to potential holidaymakers in northern Spain. Earlier this year, Brittany Ferries confirmed the introduction of a more tourism-oriented ship, the Galicia, on its Bilbao to Rosslare route, from November 2022. Currently this route is serviced by the Connemara, a predominantly freight vessel with limited facilities for holidaymakers.

The seventeenth edition of Culture Night will take place on Friday 23 September 2022.   Culture Night is managed by the Arts Council in continued collaboration with the local authorities. It is delivered nationwide in cities, towns, villages and rural locations as well as online and through media partners.  As in previous years, RTE the national broadcaster will be involved in coverage of Culture Night.    Although all activities are made available to the public free of charge, artists and performers are paid. </p>  <p>  A dedicated website will host a comprehensive list of events in every county as well as details of how to get involved.

This initiative seeks to build upon the success of the 2021 Culture Night Pilot late night events and recognises the distinctive need to develop and diversify the artistic and cultural offerings of the Night-time economy.</p>  <p>  Ahead of Culture Night 2022, the Arts Council hosted a series of nationwide meetings to share the findings from its research report and the post event analysis from 2021. These meetings offer a forum for engagement with Culture Night organisers to learn about emerging trends from organisers, audiences and artists.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Arts Council is also hosting a series of webinars throughout June and July for event organisers aimed at preparing for Culture Night 2022.</p>  <p>  Participation for local groups and communities is through the local authorities Arts Offices that oversee the organisation of the programme of events in every county.</p></reply>

It will also include standards specifying the level of competence in the Irish language required by staff of a public body so as to enable the provision of the services through Irish or through Irish and English.</p>  <p>  With regard to the difficulty in using names and addresses in Irish, a process has been laid out under section 5 of the Act in relation to the use of names in the Irish language on official documentation while there is also a provision to ensure that communications with a public body on social media are answered in the same language. </p>  <p>  Section 5 includes a provision to ensure that the IT systems and any other systems that public bodies use in their communications with the general public, allow a person&rsquo;s name, address or title in the Irish language, to be correctly recorded and used by such systems, while also facilitating the use of the s&iacute;neadh fada in Irish language text.</p>  <p>  The provision of Irish language services will also be enhanced through the implementation of a new National Plan for the Provision of Irish Language Public Services which is scheduled to be drawn over the next two years.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that work will continue on commencing other sections and provisions of the Act on a planned basis. In this context, my Department, in conjunction with Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga, is currently organising a series of online information seminars for public bodies to advise them on their new responsibilities under the Act.

This is 50:50 when  other/prefer not to say options are excluded. The CSO&rsquo;s 2020 Population Projections have a ratio of 49.8% female and 50.2% male. The applicant cohort is as-expected and aligned with the general population.</p><p><b>-  Geographical Location:</b>Applications have been received from every county. The largest number of applications was received from applicants living in Dublin; 37.1%of the applications overall.  This is followed by Cork (11%), Galway (7.4%), Wicklow (4.3%) and Kildare (3.6%). 62% of all applicants identified as Urban dwellers and 38% as Rural.  I intend to ensure that the distribution of the participants on the scheme will closely align with the geographical spread of applicants.</p><p><b>-  Art Form:</b>Applications were received from applicants practicing in all art forms listed under the Arts Act.

Hotel supply in Dublin has been challenged and affected by a range of factors, some of them short-term. These include deferred business from the last two years and increased demand.</p>  <p>  Businesses are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors but it is important that Ireland maintains its reputation as a value for money destination.  </p>  <p>  Value is not just about price, it is also about what the customer gets for that price and Irish businesses have proven before that there are numerous ways to ensure the customer experience matches the price, so that visitors are attracted back again and recommend Ireland to family and friends.</p>  <p>  The return of a sustainable and vibrant tourism sector is important for all areas and regions and I stress that it is important that businesses see and maintain a long term perspective on competitiveness and value for money. </p>  <p>  My Department officials have engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation in order to further understand underlying issues surrounding the recovery of the tourism sector and to emphasise the importance of maintaining a strong value proposition at the core of Irish tourism.  They are also working with the tourism agencies to ensure that promotional marketing campaigns are optimally aligned with supply across the sector during the year. </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and I co-chair the Tourism and Hospitality Forum; this grouping is due to meet next week and this will offer another opportunity to discuss and address these issues.</p></reply>

That includes women in leadership positions such as board members of National Governing Bodies (NGBs).</p>  <p>  In the Action Plan for Sport 2021-2023 all NGBs are being asked to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of 2023.  Failure to achieve this representation will result in financial consequences for NGBs. It is a particular priority for me and for Minister Catherine Martin to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation.</p>  <p>  Sporting bodies are making  significant efforts to improve diversity and gender representation on their boards. The most recent Board Composition Snapshot, which was published by Sport Ireland in December 2021, shows that the overall percentage of women on boards of NGBs has increased from 24% in 2019 to 32% in 2021. The Snapshot also highlights that 39 NGBs have now achieved 30% or more women on their board, up from 19 NGBs in 2019.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland continues to assist NGBs and Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) in achieving gender balance within their boards. It also provides gender diversity training to NGBs and LSPs, along with developing and investing in leadership and mentorship courses for women and girls. </p>  <p>  In addition, Sport Ireland launched its first Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Policy in Sport in May 2022. This Policy will underpin our efforts to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included in sport, whether that is in terms of active involvement, spectating, volunteering, administration or a whole host of other roles. The Sports Action Plan 2021-2023 places an important emphasis on diversity and inclusion, and the implementation of this policy will drive that process forward. </p></reply>

These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p><p>The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p><p>Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received. The assessment of all appeals is complete and the consequent allocations amounting to &euro;6.1 million were announced on Tuesday 31 May. </p><p>The total allocation of &euro;150 million for capital sports projects represented the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP.  </p><p>The priority in the short term is to advance the 2,895 successful applications under the 2020 round to &quot;formal approval&quot; and grant drawdown stage which requires detailed engagement with all grantees. Now that the appeal process is complete, my Department will also undertake a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete. </p><p>Funding is also provided by my Department for sports facilities under the <b>Large  Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund </b>(LSSIF), designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The LSSIF was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects, including swimming pools, with at least &euro;100 million being made available over the period to 2027.The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and, thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals. The projects that received provisional allocations and the amounts provisionally awarded to them are published on the Department's website.</p><p>While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the projects that were allocated funding, as it is now over two years since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department has now met with all successful grantees and work is at an advanced stage in drafting the review.</p><p>All unsuccessful LSSIF applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision if it was felt than an error was made in the assessment process.

I would encourage them to accept and implement the recommendations of the review in full.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Review is the IABA&rsquo;s own review and was underpinned by a comprehensive consultation process. The Review is very balanced and has recommendations that will benefit every part of the IABA.  The IABA has the opportunity now to move forward and accept the review and its recommendations. </p>  <p>  Delegates at the EGM will vote on a motion to create a new board which will be charged with implementing the recommendations of the Review.</p>  <p>  The Government wants to support the boxing community, and we want to see the sport thrive.  If the review is accepted, there will be an immediate pathway for the IABA to make progress. However, if the IABA is unwilling to accept the review and tackle the issues outlined in the review, then they will find that they are disallowing themselves from future funding streams, which would be to the detriment of boxing and will, unfortunately, hinder them from reaching their potential as an organisation. If the review is rejected at the EGM, it will create a lot of uncertainty for boxing.  </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland will continue to support the IABA as it goes through the various steps that are now required, beginning with the development of an implementation plan for the 64 recommendations in the review.  Sport Ireland stands ready to support the IABA in this; they will assist with necessary resources and will ensure that progress is continuously monitored, overseen and reported on.</p>  <p>  I hope that every effort will be made by the IABA to ensure acceptance of its own Review and I would encourage all of those involved in boxing, from the grassroots of the clubs to the county, provincial and national committee rooms, to encourage acceptance of the motion.</p>  <p>  The results we have seen at World and European level in recent weeks are exceptional. It must be noted that they are being achieved without a Performance Director. It makes the success all the more remarkable and gives pause for reflection as to just how much more can be achieved in the medium term with full implementation of the Review. </p></reply>

Each operator decides on their level of charges having regard to their costs and the requirement to make an adequate return on their investment. </p>  <p>  The Car Rental Council of Ireland is the representative trade organisation for the car rental industry in Ireland and is best placed to address specific queries.</p>  <p>  I understand that the difficulties being experienced by the Irish car rental sector are being encountered in other markets too and reflect a lack of car supply post-Covid. We are seeing a strong recovery in inbound international tourism in 2022, and tourism more generally, with an anticipated 2022 recovery level of 60-70% of the 2019 numbers and this mismatch between visitor numbers and rental car supply is driving prices up.</p>  <p>  There are no short-term solutions to this issue. Given the potential impact on the recovery of the tourism sector, my officials have met the Car Rental Council of Ireland who would recommend that people always contact car hire companies directly to secure the best possible price. My Department is also examining possible taxation options which might assist car rental companies to re-fleet in order to meet tourism demands.  However, taxation measures are ultimately a matter for the Minister for Finance and would have to be considered as part of budgetary considerations.    </p></reply>

In pursuit of that objective, we are committed to a Sport for All approach aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.</p>  <p>  At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023, which includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.</p>  <p>  That plan contains a specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. It further commits that this fund will apply the Sport for All ethos.  Work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in funding drawn down from the Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated from the Dormant Accounts funding for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision. </p>  <p>  I would also like to emphasise the important contribution that Sport Ireland makes in this area. Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards. </p>  <p>  In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its Participation Plan 2021-2024 &ndash; Increasing Participation in Changing Ireland. The Participation Plan outlines how Sport Ireland will continue to help people get active by removing barriers to participation in sport and physical activity in the coming years. The Sport Ireland Participation Plan actions will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies, strategic partners, clubs, communities and individuals.</p>  <p>  The Sport Ireland Participation Plan is built on, and guided by, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 (NSP) and the Sport Ireland Strategy 2018-2022. The Participation Plan takes into consideration Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013&ndash;2025 and the National Physical Activity Plan as well as global and national developments. </p>  <p>  In May 2022, Sport Ireland published its Diversity and Inclusion policy. The policy has identified five strategic pillars, which are: Change, Communication, Access, Capacity and Leadership. To support delivery, twelve desired outcomes were devised within those five strategic pillars. Sport Ireland will lead on the implementation of this policy, and will work with the sport sector and key partners to target each of the policy areas in order to deliver on its commitments.</p></reply>

The GAA&rsquo;s Green Clubs Programme has been recognised as a Sustainable Development Goals Champions Programme.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is also developing a comprehensive sustainability strategy for the National Sports Campus which will enable the campus to become an exemplar for sustainability.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently developing a new Major Sports Events Policy, which was recently the subject of a public consultation process.  The policy is still in development and it is envisaged that improving the sustainability of major sports events and exploring the use of high profile events as platforms to promote sustainability will form part of that policy development process.</p>  <p>  Capital funding for energy efficiency measures is provided as part of the Department&rsquo;s Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) and Large Scale Sports Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). A review of the SCEP is underway and consideration is being given to expanding those sustainability supports under future rounds of the Programme.</p></reply>

These challenges are not unique to Ireland; indeed, they are shared by many countries around the world.</p>  <p>  The wider tourism and hospitality sector is a shared concern for both my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE). This shared mission is reflected in the Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which was established during the pandemic and is co-chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and myself. The Forum is a valuable opportunity for both sectors to communicate their priorities and the Forum will meet again shortly. At official level, my Department engages regularly with our counterparts in DETE on issues such as work permits and other matters impacting tourism and hospitality.</p>  <p>  My Department is also represented on the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group, which brings together industry representatives, state agencies, Government Departments and the education sector. The Group has pivoted to focus on supporting the industry to address some of its immediate recruitment challenges in the months ahead. </p>  <p>  The Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are working with industry and across Government Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to engage with the Department of Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding the Tourism Recovery Taskforce&rsquo;s Recommendations on enhancing sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  As part of the drive to promote tourism as an attractive sector within which to work, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is developing a new &ldquo;Excellent Employer&rdquo; programme to help all participating businesses to improve their employer practices and build their reputation as excellent employers.  It has also launched a Transition Year Work Placement Programme and a major recruitment awareness campaign called &ldquo;Works For Me&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  When we look at the wider economy and the particular set of challenges facing the tourism industry it is clear that a collective and concerted multi-stakeholder approach to tackling these challenges is required and that is the approach that my Department and I will continue to pursue.</p></reply>

These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p><p>The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p><p>Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received. The assessment of all appeals is complete and the consequent allocations amounting to &euro;6.1 million were announced on Tuesday 31 May. </p><p>The total allocation of &euro;150 million for capital sports projects represented the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP with a significant number of local authority led projects benefiting. Details of all allocations including those to local authorities can be found at www.gov.ie/en/collection/471ed5-sports-capital-allocations/.</p><p>The priority in the short term is to advance the 2,895 successful applications under the 2020 round to &quot;formal approval&quot; and grant drawdown stage which requires detailed engagement with all grantees. Now that the appeal process is complete, my Department will also undertake a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete. </p><p>Funding is also provided by my Department for sports facilities under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund<b></b>(LSSIF), designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The LSSIF was launched in 2018 and the first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020. Thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals. The projects that received provisional allocations and the amounts provisionally awarded to them are published on the Department's website.</p><p>While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the projects that were allocated funding, as it is now over two years since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department has now met with all successful grantees and work is at an advanced stage in drafting the review. Once the review is complete the scope for awarding any additional grants, adjusting the level of existing grants and the timing of any new call for proposals will be considered.</p></reply>

Measures include the development of a bespoke carbon calculator which will allow tourism businesses to measure and understand their carbon footprint, set targets for emission reductions and benchmark their business both with themselves over time and other tourism businesses.  </p>  <p>  Understanding the imperative of a step change required at the level of the individual business, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has already designed a suite of tactical supports around food waste, water and  energy that provides businesses with the relevant and necessary advice and guidance to address imbalances and ensure that positive change can happen.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working to produce a &lsquo;Climate Action Roadmap&rsquo; along with a series of guides to explain sustainable tourism and in particular, to set out the areas of climate action required to reduce carbon emissions. It will focus on the priority areas including energy, water and food waste, explaining the terminology and providing practical tips and advice on how to start and progress the journey. A range of best in class case studies will demonstrate the net benefits to starting on the sustainability journey and a repository housing all the latest information and advice is also being developed. F&aacute;ilte Ireland plans to launch this later in 2022. </p>  <p>  I can also confirm that Tourism Ireland will create new sales and marketing opportunities for those sustainable tourism businesses that want to grow their international business. </p>  <p>  Measures such as these will shine a light on areas and destinations at home that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism. </p>  <p>  As we rebuild our tourism sector we will seek to realise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices and set out a path for a green transition of the tourism industry and our destinations to become a leading sustainable tourism destination. </p></reply>

We see them manifested in Ireland in a lack of affordable accommodation and car rental options in certain areas, and in delays at Dublin Airport.  In this regard, Tourism Ireland is monitoring any reputational impact from pricing concerns overseas and is reporting weekly on this matter to the Department. </p>  <p>  My officials have engaged with many stakeholders, including, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Car Rental Council of Ireland, in order to further understand the underlying issues giving rise to the current challenges facing the sector. They are also working with the tourism agencies to identify potential remedial actions, such as the reweighting of marketing campaigns to ensure promotional activity is aligned with supply across the year.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and I co-chair the Tourism and Hospitality Forum; this grouping is due to meet next week and this will offer another opportunity to discuss and address these issues.</p>  <p>  My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are continuing to collaborate with industry and other Government Departments to ensure that there is a coordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.  The additional funding I obtained for Tourism in Budget 2022 will allow for targeted investment in human capital, skills development and education to help address particular employment challenges faced by tourism businesses in attracting talent, assisting skills development and retaining staff. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has an extensive plan in place to support the tourism industry to address both its immediate and longer-term recruitment challenges including initiatives such as: a marketing campaign to drive awareness of live jobs in the sector, a range of supports to build the industry&rsquo;s recruitment capabilities, the new Transition Year Work Placement Programme to provide tourism and hospitality businesses with a direct link to students looking for work experience, a programme to support businesses to access people on the Live Register via the Government&rsquo;s new Pathways to Work strategy and linking businesses with local third level students.</p>  <p>  While the effective operation of ports and airports is of critical importance in terms of the recovery of our tourism sector, these matters fall within the remit of my colleague Mr. Eamon Ryan T.D., Minister for Transport.  With specific regard to the pressures at Dublin airport, I am of course concerned that if this situation were to persist it could cause significant reputational damage for the country abroad and as a result hinder the recovery of our tourism sector.  I understand, however, that both Minister Ryan and Minister of State Hildegarde Naughton are continuing to hold meetings with the CEO of the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) and his management team on these matters. Several key measures have been rolled out which aim to mitigate the risk of a repeat to recent delays and though challenges remain, the DAA has advised that the measures they have taken will substantially mitigate risk during this busy summer period.</p></reply>

Future growth within the sector needs to be delivered in a sustainable and responsible way with safe and respectful workplaces at its core.</p>  <p>  Significant emphasis is now placed on upskilling, training and continued development of our audiovisual workforce as a pre-condition of receiving a Certificate under Section 481.  In order to qualify, production companies must commit to training and upskilling outlays that are proportionate to the amount of tax relief that they ultimately receive.  The old training requirements have now been recast as life-long learning with individual participants being upskilled at all levels &ndash; from new entrants to our brightest and best given the opportunity to shadow internationally acclaimed film directors, producers and directors of photography.  Additionally, producer companies must engage with Screen Ireland&rsquo;s Screen Skills Division to provide training that is currently relevant and necessary in the industry. </p>  <p>  Along with the additional training requirements, there is an increased emphasis and scrutiny on the provision of quality employment across film projects.  Each Producer Company and Qualifying Company is required to give an undertaking, not only to be in compliance with all obligations in the field of environmental, social and employment law, but crucially to have in place written policies and procedures in relation to Grievances, Discipline and Dignity at work (including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity).  Companies must also provide details of any Work Place Commission decisions where those decision are a finding against such a company, confirmation that the finding has been followed or an explanation if the finding has not been followed.</p></reply>

These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p>  <p>  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>  Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received. The assessment of all appeals is complete and the consequent allocations amounting to &euro;6.14 million were announced on Tuesday 31 May.</p>  <p>  The priority in the short term is to advance the 2,895 successful applications under the 2020 round to "formal approval" and grant drawdown stage which requires detailed engagement with all grantees. Now that the appeal process is complete, my Department will also undertake a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete.</p></reply>

The report identified a suite of actions that aim to promote sustainable tourism practices out to 2023. These actions are being delivered by my Department, the tourism agencies and the tourism sector.</p><p>Reducing emissions will require significant change in business practices and this pathway for businesses is shaped by research and stakeholder engagement. Driving climate action is a strategic priority for F&aacute;ilte Ireland. Their Strategy aims to drive change at the level of the individual business and the destination to ensure that tourism plays its part in reducing emissions.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland is taking steps to address these challenges including the development of a &lsquo;Bespoke Carbon<b></b>Calculator&rsquo; for tourism businesses which will allow businesses to measure and understand their carbon footprint, set targets for emission reductions and benchmark their business both with themselves over time and other tourism businesses. </p><p>Understanding the imperative of a step change required at the level of the business F&aacute;ilte Ireland has designed a suite of tactical supports around Food waste, Water and Energy that provides businesses with the relevant and necessary advice and guidance to action the imbalance and ensure that positive change can happen. </p><p>A <b>&lsquo;</b>Climate Action Roadmap&rsquo; along with a series of guides will explain sustainable tourism and in particular, it sets out the area of Climate Action required to reduce carbon emissions. It focuses in detail on the priority areas including energy, water and food waste, explaining the terminology and provides practical tips and advice on how to start and progress the journey. A range of best in class case studies will demonstrate the net benefits to starting on the sustainability journey and a repository housing all the latest information and advice is also being developed.  </p></reply>

Media freedom in the State is underpinned by a robust legislative and constitutional foundation and a regulatory framework that is intended to protect media freedom and promote media plurality. </p>  <p>  Article 40(6)(1&deg;) the Constitution provides for the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. These provisions are reinforced by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFREU). Article 11 of the CFREU provides for the right to freedom of expression and that the freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected, while Article 10 of the ECHR provides for freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by a public authority. </p>  <p>  The existing framework for the regulation of sound and audiovisual broadcasting is set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. The Act provides the underpinning for an independent regulator, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), and contains provisions to ensure that the BAI is independent of Government and that the BAI will provide a regulatory environment that will sustain independent and impartial journalism. Section 98 of the Act sets out that public service broadcasters are independent in the pursuance of their object, which specifically safeguards the editorial independence to RT&Eacute; and TG4.</p>  <p>  This regulatory framework will be updated by the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, which will dissolve the BAI and establish a new regulator, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n. In particular, section 7 of the Bill requires that An Coimisi&uacute;n, in performing its functions, shall endeavour to ensure that the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression, are upheld. In addition, section 7 further provides that An Coimisi&uacute;n shall endeavour to ensure diversity and transparency in the control of communications media operating in the State and provide a regulatory environment that will sustain independent and impartial journalism.</p>  <p>  The plurality of the media in the State, which is reflected in both diversity of content and ownership and which is an important component of media freedom, is protected through the media mergers regime set out in Part 3A of the Competition Act 2002 (as amended). The aim of the regime, which is operated by my Department, is to establish the likely effect that a proposed media merger will have on the plurality of media in the State and consequently to allow me, as Minister for Media, to make a determination as whether the media merger may be put into effect, and if so, whether the merger should be subject to conditions. </p>  <p>  The BAI also plays a role in promoting and supporting media plurality through a Media Plurality Policy and an Ownership and Control Policy. The primary purpose of BAI&rsquo;s Media Plurality Policy is to set out how the BAI will support and promote media plurality. The policy provides context for the BAI&rsquo;s role in respect of media plurality; provides a definition for media plurality; outlines why media plurality is important; details policy objectives; and outlines the measures the BAI takes to promote and support media plurality in Ireland. The BAI Ownership and Control Policy gives practical effect to the obligations set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009 which the BAI must consider when deciding on the most suitable applicant for the award of a radio or television service contract. It is also used by the BAI to assess requests for changes to the ownership and control of existing broadcasting services, for example, changes in shareholdings and directors. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the European Commission intends to publish a proposal for a European Media Freedom Act. The Commission have indicated that the proposal will aim to ensure that the European Union (EU) media market functions better by improving legal certainty and eliminating internal market obstacles and that it will set out a mechanism to increase the transparency, independence and accountability of actions affecting media markets, freedom and pluralism within the EU. When the proposal is published, my Department will engage proactively with other Member States to ensure that the European Media Freedom Act safeguards media freedom, pluralism and the independence of media actors across the EU.</p></reply>

The report identified a suite of actions that aims to promote sustainable tourism practices out to 2023. These actions are being delivered by my Department, the tourism agencies and the tourism sector.</p>  <p>  Addressing climate action is a strategic priority for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and their aim is to drive change at the level of the business and the destination to ensure that tourism plays its part in reducing emissions. Measures include the development of a bespoke carbon calculator which will allow tourism businesses to measure and understand their carbon footprint, set targets for emission reductions and benchmark their business both with themselves over time and other tourism businesses.  </p>  <p>  Understanding the imperative of a step change required at the level of the business, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has already designed a suite of tactical supports around food waste, water and energy that provides businesses with the relevant and necessary advice and guidance to action the imbalance and ensure that positive change can happen.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working to produce a &lsquo;Climate Action Roadmap&rsquo; along with a series of guides to explain sustainable tourism and in particular, to set out the areas of climate action required to reduce carbon emissions. It will focus on the priority areas including energy, water and food waste, explaining the terminology and provides practical tips and advice on how to start and progress the journey. A range of best in class case studies will demonstrate the net benefits to starting on the sustainability journey and a repository housing all the latest information and advice is also being developed. F&aacute;ilte Ireland plans to launch this later in 2022.</p>  <p>  I can also confirm that Tourism Ireland will create new sales and marketing opportunities for those sustainable tourism businesses that want to grow their international business.</p>  <p>  Finally, officials in my Department have commenced work on a new national tourism policy which will place sustainability at the heart of tourism in Ireland going forward. The policy will align with the Circular Economy Strategy.</p></reply>

This is 50:50 when other/prefer not to say options are excluded. The CSO&rsquo;s 2020 Population Projections have a ratio of 49.8% female and 50.2% male.

No. 567/2021 - European Union (Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Single Market) Regulations 2021. These Regulations strengthen the rights and protections of copyright holders in order to reflect the impact of technological advances and increased digitalisation.  </p>  <p>  The Regulations also address the legal uncertainty that existed when copyright-protected material was circulated online by way of social media and online platforms. Authorisation is now required from copyright holders so that the online platforms can continue to circulate copyright-protected works such as music, videos, or other works, online. This authorisation is usually obtained by way of a license from the relevant copyright-holders&rsquo; representative, i.e., from a collective management organisation. </p>  <p>  The Regulations also provide for wider access and use of copyright protected works for the benefit of a broad range of stakeholders, including the creative sectors, press publishers, researchers, educators, cultural heritage institutions, and citizens. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Directive in 2019, my Department conducted a series of public consultations seeking the views of all stakeholders on the various provisions in the Directive to help to inform how the provisions should be applied in the context of Irish copyright legislation. A large number of submissions were received and carefully considered, with cognisance taken of the diversity of the views expressed. In its approach, my Department was guided by the overarching objective of providing a copyright legislative framework fit for the digital age and which represents a balanced consideration of the interests of all stakeholders. This analysis also included detailed consideration on how best to transpose the Directive into the existing national copyright law framework.  </p>  <p>  In concluding its analysis of the Directive, and considering the breadth of views expressed by stakeholders, my Department decided to transpose the mandatory provisions by way of Regulations contained in secondary legislation, i.e., by Statutory Instrument. This was required only for provisions that did not already reside in existing copyright legislation. In addition, and in order to keep stakeholders informed of progress in relation to the transposition of the Directive, my Department, in May 2021, published an information note which set out the actions taken to date and the decision to proceed with the transposition of the mandatory provisions by way of secondary legislation. </p>  <p>  My officials continue to actively engage with the European Commission and other Member States on the status of EU-wide implementation of the Directive.</p></reply>

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland. The Housing for All plan commits to the retrofitting of 36,500 local authority homes by 2030 as part of the achievement of these targets. The Retrofit Plan estimates that, between 2019 and 2025, almost 185,000 home energy upgrades will be delivered with over 83,000 to a B2/cost optimal level. When the emissions savings from the non-B2 upgrades are included, this is the equivalent of 120,000 B2 upgrades over the period. As a result, there will a need to deliver, on average, approximately 75,000 B2-equivalent home upgrades per year from 2026 to 2030 to achieve the overall target of 500,000 by 2030.   The National Development Plan and National Retrofit Plan have ring-fenced &euro;8 billion to support the achievement of this objective. This will be supplemented by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage budget for retrofitting local authority homes.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to lower income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 145,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.Applications under SEAI schemes are an operational matter for the SEAI. As Minister, I have no function with regard to individual grant applications. </p><p>Households who are in receipt of the following Department of Social Protection payments are eligible to apply:-  Fuel Allowance;</p><p>-  Job Seekers Allowance for more than six months (and having children under 7);</p><p>-  Working Family Payment;</p><p>-  One-Parent Family Payment;</p><p>-  Disability Allowance for more than six months (and having children under 7);</p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance;</p><p>-  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance where you live with the person you are caring for.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for the scheme were selected as they represented those areas where the limited resources available to the scheme could have the greatest impact. They are kept under review with the Department of Social Protection to ensure they are consistent with and complementary to the other income support schemes offered by that Department. All grant schemes have terms and conditions in place to ensure the transparent administration of public funds. These terms and conditions must be adhered to consistently by SEAI to ensure fairness as well as value for money for the Exchequer.</p><p>In February, the Government approved a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills. Included in these measures is the establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up form the current level of 30-5%). </p><p>As part of the supports announced, Government is clear that it is important that households that want to undertake a deep retrofit but do not have the financial means to carry out the upgrade in a single project, should be supported at the enhanced grant levels. For that reason, many of the new grant rates available under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme are also now available under the Better Energy Homes Scheme allowing homeowners to take a step-by-step approach or self-manage their project.</p><p>Furthermore, it is crucial that homeowners that do not have the financial means to carry out a deep retrofit but are not eligible for free upgrades under the Warmer Homes Scheme are also supported. This is particularly important at the present time of exceptionally high energy prices facing consumers. Therefore, to support homeowners, grant rates for cavity wall and ceiling insulation have been increased significantly to cover approximately 80% of the typical cost of these measures and will be available to all homeowners whose houses were built before 2011. There are no income eligibility criteria for these grants. </p><p>Further information is available on SEAI's website: www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/insulation-grants/.</p></reply>

The scheme is a collaboration between my Department and the Department of Health and was jointly administered by the Health Service Executive and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Since 2016, almost 1,500 homes have received free upgrades to their homes, including attic and wall insulation, window and door replacement and heating system upgrades where needed.    The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) were engaged to carry out, in collaboration with the HSE, an independent analysis of the health impacts of improved energy efficiency among the participants in the research element of this scheme. The LSHTM has been working closely with the research committee for the project, which consists of officials from my Department, the HSE, the Department of Health and the SEAI since then. An interim report including preliminary results was submitted to my Department in December 2021 and the final results and draft final report are due in the coming weeks. The interim report has indicated that  the upgrades are delivering benefits to the health and wellbeing of participants. The interim report was subject to review and feedback by the research team and HSE public health lead and will form part of the final report, which I will be publishing when it is finalised.</p></reply>

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. More information is available here: www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CRU21131-Interim-Clean-Export-Guarantee-Decision-Paper.pdf. Micro-generators who wish to become eligible should register for an export grid connection from ESB Networks (Micro-Generators (esbnetworks.ie)) and have a smart meter where applicable (Smart Meter Upgrade FAQs (esbnetworks.ie)). </p><p>Over 29,000 micro- and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and 20,000 of this cohort have smart meters which means they are already accruing the value of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff for their exported electricity, and payments will be backdated to the date of eligibility or the 15th February 2022, whichever is the latest. </p><p>The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Once eligible, customers can expect an initial payment or credit from their suppliers from 1 July depending on billing cycle. The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision to their customers on when initial Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payments will be made at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>The CRU encourages customers to contact their supplier to obtain information on their suppliers' CEG tariff arrangements.</p></reply>

This, and any experience gained outside the mandatory EDT lessons, is not subject to regulation.  However, the more experience people have the better and safer their driving will be, and also the more likely they will be to pass a driving test. </p>  <p>  I appreciate that insurance is expensive for learner drivers, but insurance companies price policies according to the statistical risk in driver categories, so the Deputy will appreciate that a learner driver with little or no experience on the roads or driving history would carry a significant risk loading for insurance underwriters.  As drivers gain experience and accumulate years of incident-free driving, they can expect their insurance costs to drop substantially year-on-year.</p></reply>

It is considered that any reversion of the reductions in pensions benefits on foot of the pension levy implementation and the method employed are matters for the trustees of the pension scheme to resolve.  My Department will assist as appropriate in reviewing any proposals in this regard. </p>  <p>  More broadly, it is acknowledged that there are increasing inflationary pressures generally as reflected in the Consumer Price Index over the last year and any future requests for consent will be considered as appropriate in light of these developments. </p></reply>

These changes have been agreed by the trustees of the Scheme, the employees and the CI&Eacute; Group following extensive and prolonged engagement between all parties.</p>  <p>  There are a number of steps before an SI can be made. In accordance with the provisions of Section 44(3) of the Transport Act 1950, I directed CI&Eacute; to publish a statutory notice of the draft SIs in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il, which was advertised on the 14th of January 2022. 45 days were given to allow any person to make objections and representations in relation to the Scheme to me. The consultation period ended on the 28 February 2022 and my Department examined the submissions received.</p>  <p>  As required under the Transport Act, consultation with the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the SIs has also taken place. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently gave his approval for my confirmation of the SIs. As such, officials in my Department are currently preparing the SIs for my signature which I expect will be completed shortly.</p></reply>

The aim of the policy is to make it easier for people across the country to choose walking, cycling and use public transport daily instead of having to travel by private car. The policy is accompanied by an action plan to 2025 which contains actions to improve and expand sustainable mobility options throughout the country. </p>  <p>  One of the policy&rsquo;s ten high-level goals is to expand availability of sustainable mobility in regional and rural areas and the action plan contains a range of actions that will be delivered by 2025 to support this goal. This includes the rollout of the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan. Starting this year, this plan is a major national public transport initiative funded by my Department and managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA). It aims to increase public transport connectivity over a five-year period, particularly for people living outside our cities. New and improved public transport services will be rolled out on a phased basis including new and enhanced services in Longford and Westmeath. The overarching aim of Connecting Ireland is to develop an accessible, integrated and sustainable network of public transport services in rural and regional areas nationwide. In Budget 2022, I was delighted to secure an allocation of &euro;5.6 million to progress, develop and begin delivery of this important plan.</p>  <p>  A programme of improved town bus services will also be implemented by 2025 under the Sustainable Mobility Policy, including in Mullingar. Alongside this, the NTA will commence delivery of an enhanced bus stop and bus shelter programme for regional and rural services.</p>  <p>  The Government has also recently introduced a number of new fare reductions to help combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country and to incentivise greater use of public transport services.  This includes a 20% average fare reduction on all PSO services until the end of 2022.  Furthermore, the introduction of a young adult card will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs across all services, including city, intercity and rural services.  This young adult discount was initially made available on PSO services last month and will then be broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.</p>  <p>  The National Sustainable Mobility Policy will be implemented in collaboration with other Government departments, the NTA, regional assemblies, local authorities and other stakeholders to improve sustainable mobility infrastructure and services across the country in the coming years.</p></reply>

With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief is only available for &lsquo;new builds&rsquo;. Broadly, the relief takes the form of a rebate of income tax, including DIRT, paid over the previous four tax years. However, it is open to claimants to select all or any of the previous four tax years for the purposes of calculating the refund available to them.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in 2018, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade commissioned a report to examine the challenges facing returning Irish emigrants. The Indecon Economic Report on Addressing Challenges Faced by Returning Irish Emigrants was published by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and is available at the following link: www.dfa.ie/media/dfa-2017/globalirish/Report-on-Returning-Emigrants-2018.pdf.</p>  <p>  The findings of the report are of relevance to the general issue raised by the Deputy as it provided insights on emigrants&rsquo; views of the barriers faced by them in returning to Ireland. In short, the report identified that a wide range of issues could be addressed with a view to attracting Irish people, born and educated in Ireland, to return from abroad.</p>  <p>  The consultants identified exclusions from the HTB incentive if they left Ireland more than four years previously as a particular tax treatment issue.  Indecon recommended a tax refund based on the last four years in which tax was paid in Ireland, with eligibility restricted to those who paid tax in last 14/15 years.</p>  <p>  However, upon further examination, my Department considered that the measure could not be recommended for implementation due to wider knock-on implications for the operation of the scheme.  As such, currently I do not have any plans to seek to amend the eligibility requirements for first-time purchasers for the purposes of the HTB incentive to be fully tax-compliant and also have submitted the appropriate tax return for each tax year relevant to the claim.  Also of relevance in this regard is that a formal review of the HTB scheme is currently underway and is expected to be completed shortly. The intention is that the exercise will help inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022, having regard to the sound management of the public finances.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will also wish to be aware that the Minister of State for Overseas Development Aid and Diaspora chairs an &lsquo;Interdepartmental Committee on the Irish Abroad&rsquo;. This committee brings together all relevant Government Departments and agencies with a view to developing an all of government approach to addressing the barriers which the Diaspora face in returning to Ireland.  The Department of Finance continues to be engaged in this process. </p></reply>

This measure was initially extended in Budget 2022 to 31 August 2022 at a further estimated cost of &euro;251m. I have now extended this measure for a further six months. The 9% VAT rate will therefore remain for these sectors until 28 February 2023 at an additional estimated cost of &euro;250m. No further extension to this measure is envisaged so the 13.5% rate will apply to these sectors from 1 March 2023.</p>  <p>  This extension will cover the same goods and services as the original measure, restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks, and hairdressing, as well as certain printed matter such as brochures, leaflets, programmes and catalogues.</p>  <p>  The further extension reflects the fact that the tourism and hospitality sectors were among those most impacted by the public health restrictions put in place throughout the pandemic. Through no fault of their own, bars, hotels and restaurants had to close on multiple occasions in response to the public health crisis. This measure will provide further support to the tourism and hospitality sectors over the busy November/December period and into the early New Year.</p></reply>

The Second Implementation report, which was published on 1 March 2022, shows that 80 per cent of these actions are now being delivered.</p>  <p>  Among the key developments so far are the implementation of the new Personal Injury Guidelines, which significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue. Recent data from the Personal Injury Assessment Board (PIAB) show that award levels have fallen by an average of 40 per cent, providing stability and certainty to the claims environment.</p>  <p>  As part of the effort to increase competition, the Department of Finance is working closely with the IDA to bring new entrants into the Irish insurance market, including in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market, such as the ones highlighted by the Deputy. The IDA is currently commencing a multi-phased engagement process with these targeted underwriters and will seek to leverage the achievements of the Government insurance reform agenda to date. </p>  <p>  In terms of upcoming issues, rebalancing the duty of care is now a high priority action for Government and is being led by the Department of Justice. Overhauling this legislation should help to address the issue of &ldquo;slips, trips and falls&rdquo;, which are particularly prevalent in high-risk/heavy-footfall areas such as sports, leisure and adventure centres.</p>  <p>  It may also interest the Deputy to know that the National Sports Action Plan 2021 -2023 provides for the establishment of a sports sector stakeholder forum to examine insurance issues in the sector. Enquiries regarding this initiative should be directed to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government and this in turn should help address some of the issues that are the focus of this Parliamentary Question. </p></reply>

In 2021 it totalled just under &euro;3.6bn. This is more than 50% below the peak of &euro;7.5bn seen in the mid-part of the last decade.</p><p>However, the period of large year-on-year declines in the interest bill is now over as most of the more expensive, crisis-era issued debt has been replaced with cheaper funding.</p><p>This year, it is estimated that there will be a slight increase in the interest bill on the National Debt, to just under &euro;3.8bn. This is the equivalent of 5% of projected tax revenue. By contrast, in 2013, this interest-to-tax revenue ratio was almost 20%.</p><p>Yields on Irish Government debt are increasing, as they are on sovereign debt around the world. This reflects the withdrawal of large-scale monetary policy support from the major Central Banks and inflation developments.</p><p>There are several factors which will help to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on Ireland&rsquo;s debt servicing costs.</p><p>- The vast bulk of Ireland&rsquo;s public debt is at fixed interest rates.</p><p>- The NTMA strategy of pre-funding means it holds significant cash balances. These stood at &euro;30bn at the end of May. This is money the NTMA borrowed in the low rate environment of recent years and means there is less to borrow at higher rates in the coming years. In addition, it affords the NTMA a great deal of flexibility regarding the timing of its funding operations.</p><p>- The amount of debt the NTMA will be required to issue over the coming years will likely be lower than in the recent past. This reflects (i) the pre-funding strategy referred to above, (ii) the improving public finances, as forecast in the recent Stability Programme Update and (iii) the quite limited refinancing needs &ndash; a consequence of the NTMAs strategy of issuing longer-term debt during the period of the ECBs Quantitative Easing programmes. The NTMA has extended and smoothened the maturity profile of Irish public debt.</p><p>So far this year, the NTMA has issued &euro;5.75bn of benchmark bonds, close to 60% of the &euro;10bn lower bound of the bond funding range. This funding was completed at a weighted average yield of 0.76% and a weighted average maturity of 13 years.</p></reply>

This allowed the State to borrow at historically low interest rates during the pandemic to fund the necessary fiscal response. Given the current inflationary environment, this era of monetary policy is now coming to an end: in short, interest rates are rising and it will be more expensive to borrow in the future.</p>  <p>  Given the relatively long average maturity of Irish debt, the impact of increased interest rates will not be fully felt in the short-run. As a result, we have the opportunity to mitigate the risk by acting now to restore the public finances to a sustainable path. </p>  <p>  Continuing to maintain elevated levels of public expenditure through borrowing will increasingly leave us exposed to future economic shocks. To address this, Government set out its medium-term budgetary strategy in the Summer Economic Statement last year. The strategy is based around an expenditure rule, whereby core expenditure growth will be kept under control through fixed ceilings linked to the trend growth rate of the economy. </p>  <p>  Of course, this strategy was framed in a very different inflationary environment than today. This year&rsquo;s Summer Economic Statement, to be published in the coming weeks, will update the parameters for discussions around Budget 2023 and will set out the budgetary stance for next year.</p></reply>

The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant such as a grandchild of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases.  </p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of his or her relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess benefit.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, where a person receives a gift or inheritance from his or her aunt or uncle, the Group B threshold of &euro;32,500 will apply.  CAT will be payable by the person at a rate of 33% to the extent that the benefit received, when aggregated with any prior gift or inheritance received since 5 December 1991, exceeds this threshold.  </p>  <p>  Nieces or nephews of the disponer may qualify for favourite niece or favourite nephew relief in respect of gifts or inheritances of business assets. The relief allows a niece or nephew who qualifies for the relief to avail of the Group A threshold. Qualifying nieces or nephews are those who have worked substantially on a full-time basis for a period of five years prior to the gift or inheritance being given in carrying on, or assisting in the carrying on, the trade, business or profession, of the disponer.  </p>  <p>  For the nephew or niece to be deemed to be working substantially on a full-time basis in the business he or she must work:</p>  <p>  - more than 24 hours per week at the place where the business, trade or profession is carried on; or  </p>  <p>  - more than 15 hours per week at the place where the business, trade or profession is carried on exclusively by the disponer, any spouse or civil partner of the disponer and the nephew or niece.</p>  <p>  The options available for providing increases to CAT thresholds are considered in the context of available resources as part of the annual budgetary process and like all matters need to be balanced against competing demands.  At the moment, I do not believe that a compelling case can be made for increasing the CAT Group threshold that applies between aunt and uncles to nieces and nephew.</p></reply>

The labour market was at the frontline of the pandemic, and a number of headline indicators were affected by the unprecedented impact of Covid-19 on the economy.

The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child. </p><p>Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies, the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.</p><p>Persons aged 65 or over may also avail of the age tax credit, which currently amounts to &euro;245 per year for single persons or &euro;490 per year for married couples or civil partners. Reduced rates of USC also apply for persons aged 70 or older where their total income is &euro;60,000 or less. </p><p>As such, the current tax arrangements for persons aged 65 or older compare favourably with the tax treatment of the generality of taxpayers. </p><p>Additional guidance on the range of tax credits and reliefs that may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-26.pdf.</i></p><p>With regard to the cost of living increases, the Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing businesses and households, including people aged 65 years or over, and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden.  On a cumulative basis, the Government has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October.  These measures include changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households and a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of certain energy products. </p></reply>

ETF investments can take many different legal and regulatory forms even where they are established within the same jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  An ETF is an investment fund that is traded on a regulated stock exchange. A typical ETF can be compared to a tracker fund in that it will seek to replicate a particular index.</p>  <p>  There is no separate taxation regime specifically for ETFs.  Being collective investment funds, they generally come within the regimes set out in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for such funds. The domicile of the ETF will generally determine the applicable fund regime, specifically whether the ETF falls within the domestic fund regime or the offshore fund regime.</p>  <p>  Where the domestic fund regime applies, a &lsquo;gross roll-up&rsquo; applies such that there is no annual tax on income or gains arising to a fund but the fund has responsibility to deduct an exit tax in respect of payments made to certain unit holders in that fund. To prevent indefinite or long-term deferral of this exit tax, a disposal is deemed to occur every 8 years.  Where the offshore fund regime applies, the applicable tax treatment depends on the location and nature of the fund.</p>  <p>  Income and gains arising from investments into Irish and EU domiciled ETFs are subject to income tax at a rate of 41% on a self-assessment basis. Such income and gains are not subject to Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) or Universal Social Charge (USC) liabilities.   This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident. In the case of non-resident investors, liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  To assist taxpayers in determining the appropriate tax treatment for investments in ETFs, Revenue has published guidance which is available at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-27/27-01a-03.pdf.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to review the taxation of Exchange Traded Funds.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive). </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, this Government recognises the concerns felt by many groups regarding the cost and availability of insurance, and has therefore prioritised insurance reform via the Action Plan for Insurance Reform which was published in December 2020. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government published the second Action Plan for Insurance Reform Implementation Report, which shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 80% of the actions already being delivered.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan is a whole-of-Government strategy contains several initiatives expected to positively impact insurance costs. For example, the new Personal Injuries Guidelines have significantly lowered award levels for many common injuries, with the latest data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) indicating that the overall average award has reduced by 42% compared to 2020. Consistent implementation of the Guidelines should therefore lead to a reduction in the cost of claims, which is the main driver of the cost of insurance.</p>  <p>  Another key development with regard to home and motor insurance costs has been the Central Bank&rsquo;s decision to prohibit price walking from 1 July 2022. This is a form of dual pricing whereby customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurance provider. This ban is a balanced approach that will protect customers who prefer to stay with their current provider from being subject to a &lsquo;loyalty penalty&rsquo;, while still allowing customers to benefit from discounts from new providers. </p>  <p>  Other actions which aim to assist in lowering insurance costs include measures to reduce fraud, the enactment of legislation making perjury easier to prosecute, as well as efforts by the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market to attract new providers. Work is also continuing across Government to drive forward the outstanding aspects of the Action Plan, including: further changes intended to reduce costs such as strengthening the PIAB (which is under the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment); and reforming the duty of care (which is under the responsibility of the Minister for Justice). It is my belief that the overall implementation of the Action Plan should help to improve both the cost and availability of insurance. </p>  <p>  Finally, recent data from the Central Statistics Office shows that average private motor insurance prices have fallen by 41 per cent since their peak in July 2016, and it is my hope that these ongoing reforms will bolster this downward trend in the wider insurance market, to the benefit of consumers, businesses and community groups.</p></reply>

Additionally, both REITs and IREFs apply withholding taxes on distributions to investors to ensure collection of tax revenues.</p><p>An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors, and further taxation is a matter for their country of residence. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place. Non-resident investors from treaty resident countries may be able to reclaim some part of IREF withholding tax if the relevant tax treaty allows for this. Irish resident investors are not subject to the IREF withholding tax as they are already subject to 41% exit tax on income/gains from funds.</p><p>Investors can also invest in Irish property through a REIT. A REIT is a quoted company, used as a collective investment vehicle to hold rental property. The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle. REITs are publicly listed companies - therefore distributions are dividends within the scope of Dividend Withholding Tax, which applies at a rate of 25%. REITs are obliged to distribute at least 85% of profits annually. Irish resident investors are liable to tax at their marginal rates on dividends received, with a credit for the DWT deducted. Non-Irish resident investors are subject to DWT at 25%. Those resident in treaty-partner countries may be able to reclaim some of this DWT under the relevant tax treaty.</p><p>Institutional investment from entities like IREFs and REITs in commercial and residential property is critically important to generating additional supply of property as part of our Housing for All plan. </p><p>It is important to acknowledge that much of the residential investment committed to by institutional investors is observed by the level of forward commit transactions &ndash; that is, the provision of capital to fund the construction of new dwellings or the agreement of binding purchase contracts that de-risk a project sufficiently to enable the sourcing of low-cost financing. Without such commitment, it is highly likely that these dwellings would not be built. </p><p><b>Individual Landlords</b></p><p>The rate of tax payable by an individual landlord on rental profits will be determined by their overall level of income.  Ireland has a progressive income tax system which provides that, as a person&rsquo;s income increases, they move up through the various rates and bands of income tax, USC and PRSI.</p><p>Section 97(1) Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) sets out the rules for computing rental profits or gains.  Landlords are entitled to deduct certain expenses from the gross rental income received and are then taxed on the balance, which is the rental profit.  Generally, expenses which are capital in nature are not allowable as deductions unless they fall into the category of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; for the purposes of section 284 TCA 1997 and can be claimed as capital allowances (over eight years at 12.5% of the allowable cost per year).  However, the expense must have been incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business of letting the property.  </p><p>In all cases involving the letting of property by an individual, if the net rental income (gross rental income minus expenses) is less than &euro;5,000 and if the landlord&rsquo;s only other source of income is employment income, he/she must declare the rental income by filing a Form 12 return. If the net rental income is over &euro;5,000, the landlord must register for self-assessment and declare the rental income in a Form 11 return.  Returns of income must be submitted by the return filing date for the year of assessment in question.</p><p>The government is acutely conscious of the pressures facing our housing system and Housing for All is the Government&rsquo;s plan to boost the supply of housing to 2030, to increase availability and affordability of housing, and to create a sustainable housing system into the future.  This recognises the critical importance of both State and private funding to increase our overall housing stock. Officials continually keep the taxation of property related income under review with a view to recommending changes if required.</p></reply>

The timeframe for delivery on this commitment is the second quarter of 2022. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of residential properties in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms, submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period of 2022-2025. The LPT returns included questions such as whether a property is vacant, the reasons for the vacancy and if the period of vacancy exceeds 12 months. The aim was to provide an indicative profile of vacant residential properties which will help to inform policy. It should be noted that LPT applies only to habitable residential properties, and derelict or uninhabitable properties are not captured under the LPT system.</p>  <p>  Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. I will be considering this issue in consultation with colleagues before reverting to Government with proposals on the appropriate response. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns shortly.</p></reply>

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with euro area inflation reaching a record 8.1% in May. </p>  <p>  The key driver of the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. Pass-through price effects are now being felt in other sectors and the recent rise in non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation, which stood at 4.9% in May, suggests inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly broad-based. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden.  On a cumulative basis, the Government has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October.  These measures include changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households and a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of certain energy products.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to bear in mind that the causes of current price pressures are not within our control. Whilst the Government will continue to work to help alleviate cost of living challenges, resources are limited and we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact.  The Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk. Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is worth pointing out that monetary policy is the first line of defence against inflation.  In this context, the European Central Bank has indicated a tightening of policy in the coming months.  By slowing demand in the economy, this should help bring demand and supply back into balance, with positive implications for inflation. </p></reply>

The Framework supports commitments contained in a number of strategies which this Government has launched. These include the National Remote Working Strategy, Our Rural Future, the Climate Action Plan and the National Planning Framework. </p>  <p>  I, along with Minister of State Smyth, published the Framework on 31 March.  The Framework provides broad strategic direction to individual organisations in the Civil Service to develop tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs. Departments and Offices are currently developing their own blended working policies and it is anticipated that these policies will be rolled out in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  In developing their own blended working policies, Civil Service Departments and Offices will have the flexibility to determine matters such as the proportion of time individual employees work remotely versus onsite and those roles that are suitable for blended working.</p>  <p>  Access to blended working by civil servants will be dependent on Departments and Offices having the ability to meet the needs of the business.  Remote working will not be available to employees on a 100 percent basis as some physical attendance at workplaces will be required to facilitate face-to-face meetings, training and other key events deemed necessary by the employer. </p></reply>

In line with international best practice the scheme will provide protection to over 2,100 properties (900 homes &amp;amp; 1,200 businesses) from the 1 in 100 year fluvial flood event and the 1 in 200 year tidal flood event.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group for the Scheme, including representatives of the OPW, Cork City Council, engineering and environmental consultants meet on a monthly basis to discuss all aspects of the Scheme and my officials keep me apprised of progress on the scheme. The most recent Steering Group Meeting was held on 2nd June 2022.</p>  <p>  The current estimated whole life cost of the Scheme is circa &euro;140m although this is likely to be revised upwards when the various design changes introduced after the Public Exhibition feedback, and inflation, are taken into account.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme is currently at Detailed Design stage and is programmed to be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for Confirmation under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 in late 2022.</p>  <p>  Once the Scheme is confirmed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, and following the appointment of Contractors, the Scheme will have an anticipated construction period of 5-6 years.</p>  <p>  I am aware that Ballincollig Weir had apparently been in disrepair for many years before a breach occurred in December 2014, which has left the weir in extremely poor condition.</p>  <p>  The issue of Ballincollig Weir, which as part of Ballincollig Regional Park is in the ownership of Cork City Council since the boundary change between Cork County and Cork City in June 2019, has been raised during discussions with the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme Steering Group. The condition of the weir, and the objectives and requirements for any works to it, is currently under discussion by all parties prior to a final decisions to be taken on what works might be undertaken as part of the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme.</p>  <p>  In June of last year, I met with the Lord Mayor of Cork City, along with members of Cork City Council and City Council Officials, to confirm OPW&rsquo;s commitment to incorporate remedial works to the weir into the construction contract and budget for the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme, if appropriate.  While there are no hydraulic benefits to the flood relief scheme from the weir, the OPW has now agreed to assess the feasibility of incorporating any remedial works to the weir into the contract and budget for the proposed Scheme.</p>  <p>  The nature of any such remedial works will be subject to an assessment of planning, structural, fisheries and cultural heritage considerations, that the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme Steering Group has asked the Scheme&rsquo;s design consultants, contracted by the OPW, to review. The consultants&rsquo; proposal to undertake a preliminary feasibility assessment and constraints study for the reinstatement of Ballincollig Weir is being finalised at present.</p></reply>

The overall objective of this review is to ensure that An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s has access to the relevant and appropriate expertise, skills and community input required in order for the Board to efficiently and effectively support the organisation in discharging its functions, to the ultimate benefit of the Gaeltacht communities it serves.</p>  <p>  The current Board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was appointed on 16 January 2018 for a 5-year period to 15 January 2023 in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Gaeltacht Act 2012. This is the second Board to be appointed under the revised arrangements in accordance with the Act.</p>  <p>  Under the current arrangement, appointments to the Board are made in two ways. Instead of holding direct elections, nominations are made to the Board from the Local Authorities whose functional areas are Gaeltacht areas. It also ensures that the appointments of the other seven members who come through the system administered by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) have the appropriate expertise and skills -  in the overall interest of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the communities it serves as a state institution.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of changes to the organisation's range of activities since 2012 - including the implementation of the language planning process, the success of which depends on the ongoing input of Gaeltacht communities from the bottom up.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it is recognised that a more democratic and revised approach may be timely.</p>  <p>  In order to advance matters, my Department has been working with the Office of Government Procurement (OGP)  to progress the appointment of consultants to undertake the review. Tenders were sought from the market on two separate occasions since last summer but none were received on either occasion. </p>  <p>  In light of this, steps are now in train on the part of the Department to appoint a consultancy with a view to commencing and completing the review as soon as possible. This in turn will inform next steps in relation to the Board of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s. </p></reply>

Ireland has made significant progress in recent years in terms of the greater  respect shown to LGBTI+ people. </p>  <p>  Media policy and regulation plays an important role in protecting LGBTI+ people from hate speech and in supporting the representation of LGBTI+ people on broadcast and other media.</p>  <p>  In this context, the existing statutory framework for the regulation of broadcasting services, as set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009, includes provisions regarding the appropriate representation of persons and groups in society. Under the Act, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is the independent regulator for broadcasting content in the State. Under section 42 of the Act, the BAI is required to make broadcasting codes governing the standards and practice to be observed by broadcasters. These codes include: </p>  <p>  -  the Code of Fairness, Objectivity and Impartiality in News and Current Affairs, which requires that the treatment of current affairs programming is fair to all interests concerned and presented in an objective and impartial manner; and,</p>  <p>  -  the Code of Programme Standards, which is designed, inter alia, to promote responsible broadcasting in which access to information, entertainment and education and a range of views are enhanced and undue offence and harm are reduced.</p>  <p>  One of the principles underpinning the Code of Programme Standards is respect for persons and groups in society. In pursuance of this principle, the Code provides that &lsquo;the manner in which persons and groups in society are represented shall be appropriate and justifiable and shall not prejudice respect for human dignity&rsquo; and that &lsquo;programme material shall not stigmatise, support or condone discrimination or incite hatred against persons or groups in society in particular on the basis of age, gender, marital status, membership of the Traveller community, family status, sexual orientation, disability, race, nationality, ethnicity or religion&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 provides for the dissolution of the BAI and establishment of a new regulator, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, which will oversee updated regulatory frameworks for broadcasting and video-on-demand service and a new regulatory framework for online safety. Section 9 of the Bill amending section 46N of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the extension of the scope of broadcasting codes from broadcasting services to video-on-demand services. To reflect this, following the enactment and commencement of the Bill such codes will be termed media service codes. The Bill also provides that existing codes will continue in force until amended or replaced by Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n. The expansion of the remit of codes will ensure that the principles underpinning the current Code of Programme Standards, such as the principle of respect for persons and groups, will extend to video-on-demand services registered in the State.</p>  <p>  As part of the new framework for online safety, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how regulated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. These categories include 40 categories of offence specific content, including categories linked to the incitement of hatred under Prohibition of Incitement of Hatred Act 1989. This is intended to protect vulnerable groups, including LGBTI+ people, from hate speech online.</p>  <p>  Section 53 of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 provides that Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n may impose a content production levy on certain media service providers to fund content production schemes. In particular, such schemes may grant support for new audiovisual programmes relating to human rights, including equality, diversity and inclusion, which would facilitate the support of programmes specifically relating to, for example, the experiences of LGBTI+ people.  </p>  <p>  My officials have been engaging with the BAI regarding the actions they are taking to promote equality, diversity and inclusion in the broadcasting sector in Ireland. The BAI is currently reviewing its 2018 Gender Action Plan and when complete, this review will inform the development of a new Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that I will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to further explore appropriate approaches to support equality, diversity and inclusion in the sector. </p></reply>

However, it was examined by my Department in consultation with NewERA, following which the Government decided to allocate an additional &euro;9.3 million in funding to RT&Eacute; through an increased contribution from the Department of Social Protection in respect of free TV licences, to enable the implementation by RT&Eacute; of the package of agreed measures.  It was also agreed that NewEra, in conjunction with my Department, would also monitor the delivery by RT&Eacute; of the revised strategy targets.</p>  <p>  With regard to the next strategy period, commencing in 2023, the BAI are engaging with both TG4 and RT&Eacute; in relation to the development of their respective Statements of Strategy. These will be submitted to my Department in due course, and in accordance with the legislative provisions in the Broadcasting Act.</p></reply>

Implementation of the actions in the Climate Action Plan is monitored quarterly, allowing for the measurement of the progress in improving the sustainability of the sectors under my remit.</p>  <p>  The Plan contains a number of actions to assist the cultural and creative sector to measure and lower its carbon output. The recently completed Greening Arts Centres pilot project provided 7 Arts Venues with sustainability and capacity-building support to reduce their carbon footprints. The latest round of the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 prioritised projects that will support Arts and Culture organisations&rsquo; efforts to reduce their carbon footprints, with 27 out of 44 projects funded including specific sustainability measures, e.g. upgrading windows, insulating buildings, and installing LED lighting. Other actions to be completed in 2022 include a review of international climate action in the cultural sector with a view to developing a green certification scheme for the cultural sector, and the launch of a sustainable outdoor events charter by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to improve the environmental performance of the events sector.</p>  <p>  In addition to its actions under the Climate Action Plan, my Department and the public bodies under its remit have been working to embed sustainability into their activities to support the green transition of the creative, cultural and events sectors.</p>  <p>  For instance, as part of the 2021 review of the National Development Plan, an assessment of the climate impact of investment decisions was conducted. Under the revised National Development Plan my Department will work to reorient its capital schemes to deliver on the ambition of the Climate Action Plan and include carbon costs as part of its appraisal processes for the redevelopment of the National Cultural Institutions and investments in Regional Cultural Infrastructure.</p>  <p>  The Screen Greening Coalition which comprises the BAI, RT&Eacute;, Screen Ireland, Screen Producers Ireland, TG4 and Virgin Media Ireland jointly funded the adaptation of the Albert Carbon Calculator for use in Ireland. The Albert Carbon Calculator is specifically designed for programme making and is used by other broadcasters internationally to measure their carbon emissions. TG4 made the use of the Albert Carbon Calculator mandatory for all productions in January 2021, and RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s Cl&aacute;racha Gaeilge has been awarded Albert certification for sustainable production and minimising its carbon footprint.</p>  <p>  Screen Ireland has introduced a set of sustainability supports for the film industry. Their Sustainability Plan, launched in April 2022, has a set of ambitious targets to achieve net-zero by 2025. The Plan includes a commitment for the mandatory use of a Carbon Calculator as a minimum requirement on all Screen Ireland funded productions, together with providing practical supports to use the carbon calculator.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council is developing a Climate Action Policy and Implementation Plan in consultation with Arts Council staff, artists, arts organisations, and other key stakeholders in partnership with experts from Julie&rsquo;s Bicycle EU, Native Events and the Green Arts Initiative in Ireland in order to bring sustainable practices to Irish events and green Irish arts.</p>  <p>  The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce included a recommendation on addressing the environmental impact of arts, cultural and event activities in its &ldquo;Life Worth Living&rdquo; report in 2020. In line with this recommendation, Minister Ryan and I launched the Creative Climate Action Fund on behalf of the Creative Ireland Programme in 2021. Under this fund, &euro;2 million has been committed to a total of 15 projects that will offer innovative means, through the cultural, arts and creative events, of engaging the public on the urgent need for climate-related system, lifestyle and behaviour changes. Implementation of the &ldquo;Life Worth Living&rdquo; report recommendations was monitored by the Arts and Culture Recovery Oversight Group, which met 8 times in 2021. Records of the meetings of both the Taskforce and Oversight Group are available at: </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/news/e7f78-latest-updates-from-the-arts-and-culture-recovery-taskforce/.</p></reply>

The relevance of the range of supports Government introduced to support and sustain the private sector and SMEs also need to be carefully explored.</p><p>The broader policy landscape relevant to the draft Roadmap has also seen significant policy developments since 2020.  This includes, amongst other things:</p><p>- National SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan;</p><p>- Industry 4.0 Strategy;</p><p>- National Artificial Intelligence Strategy;</p><p>- Smart Specialisation;</p><p>- Implementation of the Audio-visual Action Plan;</p><p>- Tax relief for the digital gaming sector in the Finance Act 2021;</p><p>- Impact 2030: Ireland&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Strategy;</p><p>- Action Plan for Apprenticeships 2021-2025;</p><p>- Technology Skills 2022.</p><p>Officials from a number of Departments continue to liaise in examining these issues further in order to understand how best to proceed and with a view to finalising the Creative Industries pillar of the new Creative Ireland Programme 2023-2027.</p></reply>

Over the past decade or so, a nationwide network of venues, arts centres and studios were provided in this way with funding from my Department.  In recent years, significant funding for projects such as these is available from the Urban Regeneration &amp;amp; Development Fund in the Department of Housing and the Rural a Regeneration &amp;amp; Development Fund at the Department of Rural and Community Development. </p>  <p>  The situation in the Dublin City Council area is particularly acute.  My Department allocated &euro;3m to Dublin City Council specifically for the provision and development of artists&rsquo; work spaces in Dublin.  Recently, officials in my Department have met with Dublin City Council to discuss artists&rsquo; studio space in Dublin in particular.  Following on from this, I have asked officials to arrange a three-way meeting between the Department, Dublin City Council and the Arts Council, to see how we can accelerate developments in Dublin. The Arts Council provides the current funding for the ongoing operation of many artists facilities.  I have recently met with the Arts Council to discuss a range of issues, including Artists&rsquo; studios.</p>  <p>  I have been proactive in providing a strong suite of supports for artists throughout the pandemic, including the introduction of a pilot basic income for artists. I can assure Deputies that supporting the provision of spaces for artists to pursue their craft is a priority for me. </p></reply>

Upskilling refers to enhancement of skills for those already in the Audio-Visual workforce. My Department is working with Screen Ireland, the national agency for Irish film, TV drama, animation and documentary to ensure that there is a focus on training and upskilling at all levels of the industry and, crucially, as one of the criteria for the Section 481 film tax relief. </p>  <p>  Screen Ireland has transformed the operation of the upskilling requirement of Section 481 tax relief in recent years.  Skills development opportunities are open to all: whether they be new entrants to the industry, trainees, upskillers, people receiving mentoring and shadowing opportunities, or people availing of skills courses. This inclusive approach introduced life-long-learning and allows people at all levels of a production to learn and progress.</p>  <p>  To help ensure Skills Development Plans are appropriately delivered, a compliance stage at the end of production must be provided and in the case of larger productions (with eligible expenditure greater than &euro;2m) must be signed off by Screen Ireland before the last 10% of the tax credit can be claimed.</p>  <p>  In the last number of years, over 140 skills development plans have been submitted to Screen Ireland for approval and over 1,500 skills participants have been tracked on those productions.  As well as the skills development aspect of the Section 481 skills plan, producers are also encouraged through the Skills Development process to introduce both Sustainability initiatives and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives on their productions and this has contributed to significant positive changes within the sector.</p></reply>

This work encompasses not only the collection, preservation and display of heritage objects and artworks, but also educational activities that facilitate the public&rsquo;s understanding of items in the collections and the broader context in which they were produced.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of both sharing this knowledge with communities across the country as well as the need to safeguard these precious objects by ensuring that they are displayed in sites that are secure and have  appropriate environmental controls.  An important vehicle for supporting the presentation of objects from the National Collections across the country is my Department&rsquo;s Mobility of Collections Scheme.  The Scheme is designed to fund the transport, cost of insurance and exhibiting costs for pieces from the National Collections to institutions around the country with a particular focus on showing items with specific local or regional interest to those communities. While there was no activity under the mobility of collections scheme in 2020 or 2021 due to the operational challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department continues to support the scheme in 2022.  </p>  <p>  The National Cultural Institutions (NCIs) are equally committed to increasing access to the national collections through online programmes and by lending objects to local exhibitions.  While the NCIs under the aegis of my Department are independent in their management of day-to-day matters, the loaning and dissemination of items from the National Collection under their care is actively encouraged.</p>  <p>  During the pandemic, which includes the period since June 2020, the NCIs also demonstrated great innovation by sharing the national collections online. </p>  <p>  The following presents a summary of key online and other presentations of the National Collections around the country over the period since June 2020:</p>  <p>  - The Chester Beatty has presented online tours and public programmes, including lectures, music events, family workshops and cooking demonstrations to over 50,000 audience members in 2021. So far in 2022, the Chester Beatty has brought their object-based learning programmes to primary schools in Kilkenny, Limerick and Louth.</p>  <p>  - The IMMA Online programme made thousands of artworks available to audiences around the country through the digitisation of its collection. With &ldquo;Talking Art Online&rdquo;, the museum hosts regular talks on the collection with community groups. These are offered to Broadband Connection points in rural areas through the Department of Rural and Community Affairs and IMMA has delivered sessions from Achill Island to Carlow.  IMMA have a network of at least 30 regional centres countrywide often with as many as 250-300 collection loans per year appearing around the country. At present, there are works on loan in Belfast, Galway, Drogheda and Banbridge, Co. Down. All of these were accompanied by learning and engagement programmes devised by IMMA and the collaborating venue. </p>  <p>  - The National Museum of Ireland (NMI) is very active on a national basis, not least at the Museum of Country Life in Turlough Park, Co. Mayo, which falls under the aegis of the NMI. The Museum of Country Life hosts onsite tours, schools workshops and community programmes on a regular basis. At present, the NMI has loaned objects - most of which are archaeological - to museums, libraries, art centres and other venues in Kerry, Kildare, Wicklow, Cavan, Derry, Down, Clare, Tipperary, Cork, Meath, Carlow, Monaghan, Limerick, Waterford, Offaly, Fermanagh, Roscommon, Galway and Westmeath.</p>  <p>  - The National Concert Hall has delivered a number of programmes online and regionally, including Health &amp;amp; Harmony, their national programme for music for dementia, which was presented at eight national centres in spring 2022, as well as Music in Mind &ndash; their national programme for music for mental health, which took place in 5 centres nationally. The NCH intends to tour these programmes to additional centres now that public health restrictions have been removed. The NCH also presented Music in Children&rsquo;s Hospitals: Kids&rsquo; Classics, a national programme bringing music into the paediatric healthcare setting, to hospitals in Dublin, Cork, Drogheda and Limerick during 2021.</p>  <p>  - The National Archives brought the exhibition &ldquo;Treaty 1921 &ndash; Records from the Archives&rdquo; on tour in 2022 following its hugely successful presentation at Dublin Castle. The Anglo-Irish Treaty is one of the most significant historical documents held by the National Archives. Using it as a centrepiece, the National Archives presented an exhibition that marked its role as the official repository of the records of the State, one hundred years since its formation. The Treaty, 1921: Records from the Archives opened up significant historical records, official documents and private papers for the first time in the history of the State, including the first public presentation of the Treaty document. The exhibition opened in Dublin on 6 December 2021 until the 27 March 2022. A regional tour in partnership with Local Authorities has since visited Wicklow Library and Archives, Source Arts Centre in Thurles, Donegal County Museum, Wexford County Council, St. Peter&rsquo;s Church in Cork as well as Limerick City and County Council.</p>  <p>  - The Crawford Art Gallery in Cork loaned artworks to institutions in Limerick, Louth, Tipperary and Belfast throughout 2021 and 2022. The gallery also organised online educational events, tours and other programming aimed for primary schools, families and the general public including 24 sessions for young residents of direct provision centres. During the closures necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, CAG focused on making resources available to secondary school teachers via the ATAI and the Professional Development Services for Teachers. The gallery also presented several online-only exhibitions that were available to audiences nationwide including &ldquo;Building as Witness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Citizen Nowhere | Citizen Somewhere: The Imagined Nation,&rdquo; was accompanied by a virtual tour, extensive video content and a national radio campaign to provide the public an opportunity to experience the exhibition virtually.</p></reply>

The Arts Council seeks to support festivals on a year-round basis and makes a significant contribution to both major festivals and to over 150 small festivals throughout the country through its festival investment scheme.  The Council recognises the distinctive role arts festivals play in sustaining a vibrant and sustainable arts profile at local level. Festivals provide opportunities for artists and audiences to experience new work and ways of making work.  </p>  <p>  My Department operates a small-scale local festivals and summer schools funding scheme designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other essential Government moneys and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council or similar bodies.  </p>  <p>  In addition a number of local authorities support small-scale festivals, in some cases, under the all-of-Government Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022, led by my Department.  Under its Creative Communities initiative, annual funding is provided to the 31 local authorities to enable them implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022, with &euro;6.6 million provided in 2021. This funding also supports Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of free creativity for children and young people. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also provides supports for festivals and participative events that focus predominantly on internationally-motivating festivals/events from the point of view of inbound international tourism and bednights.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's 'Winter in Dublin' campaign was created to promote a specially curated programme of cultural events and experiences taking place in the capital throughout the Winter. Flagship events within the campaign - such as TradFest - promoted Irish musical talent at their core. </p></reply>

It is important to remember that the Arts Council is independent in all decisions around funding, including who to fund and how to fund them. A key strategic priority of the Arts Council is a commitment to support emerging artists of promise and all artists &ndash; creative and interpretive &ndash; whose quality of practice merits investment. </p>  <p>  From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, the Arts Council adopted a pro-active approach to supporting individual artists of all genres as well as arts organisations. Since then, the Arts Council introduced new and enhanced funding programmes of commissions and bursaries.  The 2021 budget allocation to the Arts Council increased to &euro;130 million. In 2021 the Arts Council had over 8,000 applications.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the Council expanded the bursary scheme across all art forms in both number and value in 2021. The number awarded increased from 170 in 2019 to 577 in 2021 (+239%) and the value of the awards increased from &euro;1.8 million in 2019 to &euro;9.3 million in 2021 (+412%). Particularly notable within this overall trend was an increase in funding for Literature from &euro;366,084 to &euro;1.8 million, Music from &euro;127,775 to &euro;1.4 million, and Traditional Arts from &euro;30,410 to &euro;531,158. </p>  <p>  Details of 2022 bursaries' schemes can be accessed on the Arts Council's available funding page via this link www.artscouncil.ie/available-funding/ </p>  <p>  A report and analysis of the Arts Council&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis for the arts in 2020/2021 was published by the Council and can be accessed at this link: www.artscouncil.ie/uploadedFiles/wwwartscouncilie/Content/Publications/Research_reports/Our%20Covid%20Response%20(July%202021).pdf.  </p>  <p>  The Arts Council supports artists in Ireland through grant funding, project awards and supports to individual artists by way of commissions and bursaries. The Next Generation Artists Award were first introduced to mark the 1916 centenary. The purpose of the Award is to support promising artists across all disciplines at an early but pivotal stage in their career - providing support for emerging artists from all backgrounds and genres with an opportunity to develop their skills and produce new work. Further details of the 2022 award including criteria and guidelines can be accessed at the following link www.artscouncil.ie/Funds/Next-Generation-Artists-Award/.  In addition art organisations funded by the Council regularly engage in support of emerging artists and fostering of excellence in local contexts. </p>  <p>  In addition to measures funded by the Arts Council, the Deputy will be aware of the Basic Income for the Arts Pilot Scheme. The overarching objective of this scheme is to address the earnings instability that can be associated with the intermittent, periodic, and often project-based nature of work in the arts. The scheme will research the impact on artists and creative arts workers creative practice of providing the security of a basic income, thereby reducing income precarity. </p>  <p>  The following categories of applicants were eligible: </p>  <p>  - Practising artists; </p>  <p>  - Creative arts workers (see definition below), or; </p>  <p>  - Recently trained applicants (within the last 5 years). </p>  <p>  The key eligibility criteria is that applicants must either be an artist with their own creative practice or a creative arts worker who has a creative practice of their own which makes a key contribution to the production, interpretation or exhibition of the arts. The Basic Income for the Arts pilot scheme will run over a three year period (2022 &ndash; 2025).  Applications for the scheme closed on May 12th and the scheme was open to eligible artists and creative arts sector workers. </p>  <p>  Culture Ireland also operates a range of funding programmes to support and promote the presentation of Irish arts internationally, including emerging artists. </p>  <p>  In addition to direct funding from my Department and the Arts Council, RT&Eacute; routinely offers new and emerging talent opportunities across all of its platforms including television, radio and online. It has also collaborated with the Creative Ireland programme in conjunction with its RT&Eacute; Supporting the Arts initiative to highlight a broad range of cultural activity. </p></reply>

This funding supported additional community-led initiatives including in relation to children and young people, health &amp;amp; wellbeing of older people, economic development and climate action. In February 2022, Government agreed in principle that the Creative Ireland Programme, including its Creative Communities initiative, will continue for a further five years encompassing the period 2023-2027.  Throughout 2022, the 31 local authorities are developing, through public consultation, new 5 year Culture and Creativity Strategies to enable the delivery of community-led creative projects and initiatives.  The Government has agreed to extend the Creative Ireland Programme to 2027.</p>  <p>  My role as Minister with responsibility for leading the co-ordination of the Decade of Centenaries Programme (2012-2023) is to help ensure that the challenging events of this important and formative period in our history and related themes, are meaningfully, proportionately and sensitively remembered.  Last December, I announced funding of &euro;2 million for local authorities in 2022, to support their leading role in developing community-led commemorative activities, for the final phase of the Decade of Centenaries Programme.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council&rsquo;s Framework for Collaboration Agreement with the County and City Management Association (CCMA) is critical to the success of many of the Arts Council initiatives. Much of these have been achieved in this respect with an Arts Service in each of the principal local authorities in the country. Similarly, a long-term partnership with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on our Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta programme has resulted in a significant level of arts development in Gaeltacht areas.</p>  <p>  Much of the nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres are initiated and funded by local authorities.  Support provided to  arts facilities by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained.  Such facilities are also supported through small capital grant schemes operated by my Department. </p>  <p>  In response to Covid-19,  capital funding towards the pilot Outdoor Public Space Scheme 2021  by my Department is intended to fund local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and of the needs of the local arts community. Outdoor public spaces that can provide year-round use can improve well-being and contribute positively to the public realm.</p>  <p>  In addition, significant funding has been provided by my Department in 2021 and 2022 for the Local Live Performance Support Scheme.</p></reply>

As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how designated online services, including certain social media services, are expected to deal with defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms.</p>  <p>  In particular, online safety codes will ensure that designated online services take appropriate measures to reduce the availability of content on their services which is linked to one or more of 40 existing criminal offences. </p>  <p>  Such content will include, for example, material which is connected to relevant offences under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, or Coco's Law.

A total of 52 pools has been completed under the LASPP and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme with the Lucan project currently under construction. </p><p>My Department's capital support for any new swimming pools is now being provided through the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF).

All applications were assessed in accordance with the published Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines and the first allocations were announced in January 2020. Thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations include funding for 8 swimming pool projects as follows:<ol type="1"><li>Laois: Portarlington Leisure Centre Swimming Pool [Allocation &euro;300,000]</li><li>Sligo: Waterpoint Aqua Park [Allocation &euro;300,000]</li><li>Kilkenny: The Watershed Development, [Allocation &euro;1,443,750]</li><li>Limerick: Askeaton Pool and Leisure[Allocation &euro;646,659]</li><li>Wicklow: Wicklow Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre [Allocation &euro;864,177]</li><li>Louth: Dundalk Leisure Centre [Allocation &euro;300,000]</li><li>Galway: Galway Regional Aquatic &amp;amp; Fitness Centre [Allocation &euro;8,003,415]</li><li>Dublin: Samuel Beckett Civic Campus Phase 2[Allocation &euro;5,000,000]</li></ol>The priority in the short term is to advance all LSSIF projects, including these swimming pools, to  construction stage.  </p><p>In relation to future swimming pool funding, my Department is currently undertaking a review of progress on all existing LSSIF grants. As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals. The review work is at an advanced stage and is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>In addition, the National Sports Policy commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, contains an action to develop and implement a National Swimming Strategy to provide additional swimming opportunities indoors and outdoors. Initial preparatory planning work has been undertaken by my Department in this regard. It is intended to establish a working group in the near future to take forward the detailed work of preparing a national swimming strategy, with a view to its completion and publication later this year.</p><p>The outcome of these reviews and strategies will be fully considered when deciding on the future funding provision for swimming pools.</p></reply>

The network of 29 LSPs undertakes a wide range of actions with the aim of increasing sport and physical activity participation levels in their local communities.  The design, delivery and evaluation of targeted initiatives by LSPs directly increases the level of sports participation locally, particularly amongst the harder to reach social groups such as people with a disability, people from areas of socio economic disadvantage, ethnic minorities, older adults and women. Through their expertise and local connections with the sports communities, LSPs are able to identify specific needs and deliver effective initiatives accordingly.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Sports Capital and Equipment Programme is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion. The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising the investment in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  An overall package of &euro;150 million in new capital grants under the latest round of the Programme was announced earlier this year. This funding reflects the government&rsquo;s ongoing support to sport and the unprecedented level of applications received reflects the vital role that sport plays in supporting community and individual wellbeing, a role that came into sharp focus during the pandemic. </p></reply>

In the context of culture, the goal is to &ldquo;support and develop engagement with, and in arts, culture and creativity by individuals and communities thereby enriching lives through cultural activity; and to promote Ireland&rsquo;s arts, culture and creativity globally while also coordinating the Decade of Centenaries 2012&ndash;2023 commemorations programme.&rdquo; The Statement of Strategy is available at this link www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/9205f-statement-of-strategy-20212023/. </p><p>Some &euro;371.4 million is allocated to the arts and culture sector this year including record levels of funding for the Arts Council and Screen Ireland in recent Budgets.  The Arts Council maintained the record &euro;130 million funding allocated in 2021, allowing it to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties and empowering it to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead.</p><p>&euro;25 million is allocated to pilot a new Basic Income for the Arts Pilot Scheme. This measure was the #1 ask from the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force and will bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector on a national, regional and local basis.</p><p>I am cognisant of the challenges faced by the arts, culture and live entertainment industry as the sector recovers post-pandemic.I have provided a &euro;50 million suite of supports for the live performance sector in 2022, to provide performance and employment opportunities for artists and crews, including &euro;5m for Local Authorities to support local artists and performances through the LLPSS (Local Live Performance Support Scheme).  This scheme has provided thousands of hours of employment for local musicians, artists and crews.</p><p>Funding for the arts and culture sector also includes &euro;4 million to deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force and &euro;5 million in additional funding for the national cultural institutions to ensure they continue to provide high-quality services to the public.</p><p>My role as Minister with responsibility for leading the co-ordination of the Decade of Centenaries Programme (2012-2023) is to help ensure that the challenging events of this important and formative period in our history and related themes, are meaningfully, proportionately and sensitively remembered.I have allocated &euro;5 million to support the 2022 commemorative programme which will deliver rich and diverse national and local programmes marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022.Many of these investment programmes under will be delivered through the local authorities.</p><p>Earlier this year, I announced the Government&rsquo;s decision to extend the Creative Ireland Programme until 2027.  Creative Ireland was launched in 2017 as an all-of-Government culture and wellbeing programme committed to the vision that every person should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential.  Creative Ireland collaborates across Government and with arts, community and voluntary organisations to deploy creativity as a strategy for wellbeing, social cohesion and economic success.  Alongside its very successful Creative Youth initiative, the programme&rsquo;s Creative Communities partnership with the 31 local authorities, and their delivery of thousands of creative projects, has been key to enabling community-led nationwide engagement.Earlier this month Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2022, took place on Saturday 11 June 2022 with events in every county.  <b></b>This initiative<b></b>is being delivered through the network of Creative Ireland Coordinators and local authority Culture and Creativity Teams in each of the 31 local authorities and is supported by RT&Eacute;. </p><p>In response to Covid-19,  capital funding towards the pilot Outdoor Public Space Scheme 2021  by my Department funds local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and of the needs of the local arts community. Outdoor public spaces can provide year-round use can improve well-being and contribute positively to the public realm.</p><p>It is worth noting that much of the nationwide infrastructure of venues and arts centres were initiated and funded by local authorities. These centres are supported through capital schemes largely operated by my Department. Support provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained  both for arts organisations and arts workers.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the Department of Rural and Community Development funds a range of programmes and schemes to assist in rural and community development which are available to eligible community groups and organisations throughout the country. These schemes provide funding, support and assistance to communities at local level and include the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the LEADER programme; the Community Enhancement Programme, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme; the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Community Services Programme. Details of funding allocations under specific schemes provided by that Department are available online at www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-rural-and-community-development/.</p></reply>

They are also working with the tourism agencies to identify potential remedial actions to ensure that promotional activity is optimally aligned with supply across the year.</p>  <p>  As we enter the peak summer months and the tourism industry recovers, there is inevitably additional pressure on hotel capacity and pricing.  The initial recovery phase has been unpredictable and the speed and pace of the return of tourism has brought issues for all tourism businesses,  many of which are repeated in other markets around the world. Hotel supply in Dublin in particular has been challenged and affected by a range of factors, some of them short-term.

These challenges are not unique to Ireland; indeed, they are shared by many countries around the world.</p>  <p>  The wider tourism and hospitality sector is a shared concern for both my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE). This shared mission is reflected in the Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which was established during the pandemic and is co-chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and myself. The Forum is a valuable opportunity for both sectors to communicate their priorities and the Forum will meet again shortly. At official level, my Department engages regularly with our counterparts in DETE on issues such as work permits and other matters impacting tourism and hospitality.</p>  <p>  My Department is also represented on the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group, which brings together industry representatives, state agencies, Government Departments and the education sector. The Group has pivoted to focus on supporting the industry to address some of its immediate recruitment challenges in the months ahead. </p>  <p>  The Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are working with industry and across Government Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to engage with the Department of Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding the Tourism Recovery Taskforce&rsquo;s Recommendations on enhancing sustainable employment.</p>  <p>  As part of the drive to promote tourism as an attractive sector within which to work, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is developing a new &ldquo;Excellent Employer&rdquo; programme to help all participating businesses to improve their employer practices and build their reputation as excellent employers.  It has also launched a Transition Year Work Placement Programme and a major recruitment awareness campaign called &ldquo;Works For Me&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  When we look at the wider economy and the particular set of challenges facing the tourism industry it is clear that a collective and concerted multi-stakeholder approach to tackling these challenges is required and that is the approach that my Department and I will continue to pursue.</p></reply>

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.</p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to increasing social housing delivery and plans to deliver more than 90,000 social homes to 2030.</p><p>My Department operates a number of funding programmes that assist local authorities to work in partnership with AHBs to construct, purchase and lease new homes and make them available for social housing. One such programme that provides finance to assist AHBs progress construction projects is the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF). </p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to the AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.<b></b>Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department.</p><p>With regard to the specific project mentioned, I can confirm that the project received conditional CALF funding approval in 2019 for 34 social housing homes.<b></b>While my Department has not had any direct engagement with the Loughlinstown Housing Co-Operative, it actively engages with the local authority and Co-Operative Housing Ireland.<b></b>The most recent update from Co-Operative Housing Ireland is that, Loughlinstown Co-Op re-tendered the project following the withdrawal of the preferred tenderer from the procurement process.  The closing date for the recent tender competition was the 13 June 2022 and the submissions received are currently being appraised by the AHB.  This is the first stage of a two stage process.  Subject to acceptance of the tender process, a delivery date will be confirmed.  <b></b></p><p>My Department publishes a quarterly Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report, which sets out the continuing progress being made in advancing the national local authority and AHB new-build pipeline.  The latest report, setting out the position at end Q4 2021, can be accessed at the following weblink:  </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/af746-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q4-2021/.</p></reply>

This could benefit those seeking venues for the Night-Time Economy (NTE), while also finding compatible uses by day e.g. as &lsquo;pop up&rsquo; shops, community gardens, exhibition, cultural or co-working spaces. Typically, landowners offer short term leases for low rent on empty spaces that are awaiting longer term development proposals, which can bring activity and help keep an area vibrant until wider regeneration plans can be realised.</p>  <p>  Under Action 16 of the NTE Taskforce Report a dedicated workshop was held on 11 May 2022 to understand and determine the range and practical scope of planning and development-related actions that can support the NTE.

These include a commitment to to examine defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report &quot;Safe as Houses?&quot; and to assist owners of latent defect properties, by identifying options for those impacted by defects, to access lowcost, long-term finance.  Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates these commitments. </p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected,</p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>1. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>2. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>1. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>1. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>2. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>3. Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>The working group is currently concluding its deliberations in support of the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and working towards finalisation of its report.  Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB), and with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes.</p><p>On 19 January, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focused on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p><p>- One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this category;</p><p>- Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and</p><p>- Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs.</p><p>Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p><p>On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are:</p><p>(i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter;</p><p>(ii) are in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and</p><p>(iii) can be completed during 2022.</p><p>The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. It is a matter for individual local authorities to identify suitable acquisitions in line with local circumstances and their social housing allocations policy. </p><p>Another commitment under Housing for All required my Department to undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of the 20% discretion available to local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support. </p><p>Following this analysis, I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the HAP discretion rate to 35% and, for new tenancies, to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons where required. Further details will be available when the engagement process is complete. These changes will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been implemented by successive governments, informs our active approach to peace support operations, crisis management, conflict resolution, and peacebuilding. There are no plans to alter this policy at this time and the Government has no plans to hold a referendum on neutrality.</p>  <p>  However, it is clear that the security situation in Europe has changed fundamentally. The war in Ukraine, the decisions by Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership, and the upcoming response to the recommendations by the Commission on the Defence Forces have all brought security and defence issues to the fore domestically.  </p>  <p>  In this context, there is undoubtedly a need for debate on security and defence policy in Ireland, to reflect on the security and defence challenges we face as a country and the best way for us to respond to those challenges. The Taoiseach has indicated that the issues involved could potentially be discussed through a Citizens Assembly or a similar framework. It is important that this debate take place in an open and evidence-based way, and at an appropriate time.  The Taoiseach has already noted that this could happen during the lifetime of the current Government.   </p>  <p>  As I have said previously, the Government&rsquo;s immediate focus in the meantime remains on easing the plight of the Ukrainian people and holding the Russian leadership to account for its war of aggression against Ukraine.</p></reply>

As the Opinion states, the aspiration to belong to the European Union has for many years been an important priority for Ukraine, its governments and citizens. It has been an underlying motive for democratic changes over the past decade and a driver of a number of key reforms founded on European values. </p>  <p>  The decision in late 2013, of the then-President of Ukraine not to sign, the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which symbolised for many Ukrainians a path towards the European Union, led to large-scale protests against the authorities. Subsequently, the Russian Federation moved against Ukraine, not accepting the independent choice of the Ukrainian people. While losing control over part of its territory and suffering human and economic losses because of the conflict in the eastern part of the country, Ukraine continued throughout the years as a resilient democracy, gradually aligning with the EU acquis.</p>  <p>  Since 2014, the main framework for the EU&rsquo;s partnership and cooperation with Ukraine was the Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). Implementation of reforms by Ukraine, as envisaged in the Association Agreement (AA), has been an core element of Ukraine's EU prospective. Ireland consistently encouraged Ukraine on its reform path.</p>  <p>  In September 2021, new de-oligarchisation legislation was passed in Ukraine which allows for the creation of a registry of oligarchs. Those on the registry are forbidden to make contributions in support of political parties or participate in large-scale privatization. Also, persons from this Register have to submit a declaration of income.  In addition, civil servants are required to file "declarations of contact" if they have been in contact with the oligarch or their representative. Failure to file such a declaration may result in political or disciplinary action. </p>  <p>  Ukraine has approved a Strategy on Combating Organised Crime in  2020; the Action Plan for the Strategy is under development. A  government regulation on Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessments (SOCTA) was  adopted in 2022 and Regional Organized Crime Threat Assessment Task Forces (ROCTAFs)  were launched nation-wide.</p>  <p>  My Department is carefully studying the opinion of the European Commission on Ukraine's application for EU membership.  The Irish Government hopes for a positive response on Ukraine's application at the European Council meeting of 23-24 June.  Ireland will continue to emphasise the importance of reforms in Ukraine, including in the areas of rule of law, good governance and combatting corruption.</p></reply>

The Customer Service Hub has handled over 123,000 queries to date this year and is currently handling an average of 1,200 queries per day. During times of peak demand, there can be delays in getting through to a service agent due to the high volumes of enquiries. The Passport Service webchat at www.dfa.ie/passports is also operational and customers should refresh the page if the icon is grey. A webchat operator is available when the icon is green. </p>  <p>  Staff on the Oireachtas Urgent Query Service team continue to work productively under increasing pressure. They are dealing with record numbers of calls and queries every week and have handled over 17,500 queries from Members since the beginning of this year.</p>  <p>  On Monday, 13 June, phones and webchats were fully operational in both the Customer Service Hub and on the Oireachtas Urgent Query Service line.  The Customer Service Hub handled 800 calls and 400 webchats. The Oireachtas line team handled 430 queries over the course of 150 calls. </p>  <p>  The Customer Service Hub is the priority for allocation of new staff from the recent Temporary Clerical Officer competition completed by the Passport Service. Since the week of 23 May, 35 new officers have been assigned to the Customer Service Hub. My Department has been working with the HSE to provide opportunities to contract tracing staff to transfer to the Passport Service. As of Monday, 20 June, these staff have begun to be assigned to the Customer Service Hub, which will further increase the number of staff answering customer queries. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience in the provision of this essential citizen service.</p></reply>

FBR staff have since processed 7,000 FBR applications while also continuing to provide support to Passport services due to the unprecedented levels of passport demand.</p>  <p>  The FBR Service provides an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p>  <p>  With regard to the application to which the Deputy has referred, this application has been processed and the applicant has now been entered onto the Foreign Birth Register. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand for passports and FBRs since June of last year. A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway over the past several months. This has seen the Passport Service taken on over 400 staff since June 2021.</p>  <p>The unprecedented level of staff currently working in the Passport Service will be maintained in the months ahead.  This will allow for the reassignment of additional staff to the processing of FBR applications with the aim of significantly reducing turnaround times for these applications by the end of this y  ear.</p></reply>

The journalist Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega were detained by Belarusian authorities following the forced diversion of a Ryanair aircraft to Minsk in May 2021.</p><p>Reports indicate that Mr Protasevich and Ms Sapega were sent to prison until June and subsequently transferred to house arrest. Mr Protasevich appears to have been the subject of state violence and intimidation, and gave what observers suggested was a coerced confession on state television in June 2021. Mr Protasevich faces charges of causing civil disturbances, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison. He has yet to go on trial and the status of the investigation against him is unclear.</p><p>In May of this year, a Belarusian court sentenced Ms Sapega to six years in jail, on politically-motivated charges of inciting social discord, and illegally collecting and disseminating information about the private life of an unnamed person without his consent.</p><p>The ongoing state persecution of Mr Protasevich and Ms Sapega is an affront to freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the fundamental principles of democracy. Unfortunately, they are not the only victims of Alexander Lukashenko&rsquo;s campaign to suppress all opposition to his rule. Viasna, a human rights organisation, reports that there were 1,227 political prisoners in Belarus as of 16 June.</p><p>Ireland has repeatedly condemned the Lukashenko regime in international fora, including the UN Security Council and the Human Rights Council. We have supported six packages of sanctions concerning Belarus, and co-sponsored the two most recent packages. We continue to engage regularly with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and other figures in the Belarusian opposition. In terms of funding, we have provided &euro;50,000 to the International Accountability Platform for Belarus to help ensure that those perpetuating this repression can one day be held accountable for their actions. We have also provided &euro;150,000 to support independent media in Belarus.</p><p>Political prisoners are a specific focus of Ireland&rsquo;s advocacy on Belarus, and I thank those Members of the Oireachtas who have sponsored political prisoners to help raise awareness of their plight.</p></reply>

Food prices are rising as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Responding, my Department through the Irish Aid programme has contributed over &euro;48 million in direct humanitarian support to drought-affected Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia over the past 18 months, working with partners on the ground who can act fast to provide life-saving critical assistance to those who need it most. These interventions complement the Irish Aid investment of over &euro;12 million in development funding last year to communities across the region, including in partnership with Irish NGOs, to help address the underlying causes of food insecurity and to build community resilience.</p>  <p>In addition, communities in the drought-affected countries are being supported through Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to multilateral humanitarian action, such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which reacts immediately to crises as they happen. Ireland is the 8th   largest contributor to CERF providing &euro;11.5 million in 2022. Since 2021, the CERF has allocated almost $100 million to help drought-affected communities in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a consistent advocate for increased support to the Horn of Africa at a global level. On 26 April Ireland delivered a statement at the high-level roundtable chaired by the UN and EU on the drought in the Horn, at which member states pledged $1.3bn to the humanitarian response. As informal focal point on hunger and conflict at the UN Security Council, Ireland has consistently shone a spotlight on the underlying causes of food insecurity and the links between conflict and hunger and the impact of climate change.  Ireland also hosts bi-annual briefings for UNSC member states by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on food insecurity in conflict affected countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a committed global leader in the global food and nutrition space with prominent political leadership and funding on the world stage. Following the UN Food Systems Summit and the Nutrition for Growth Summit in 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to leadership and support for food security and nutrition was reaffirmed with a pledge to spend &euro;800 million over the coming 5 year period for nutrition programmes and interventions.</p></reply>

The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. </p>  <p>  Photographic identification is required for all adult first time passport applications. The Passport Service accepts the following forms of photo identification: original government issued photographic identification, such as a Public Services Card, an original passport from another country or a certified copy of a driver&rsquo;s licence (certified by a solicitor or notary public). </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the Passport Service has contacted the applicant directly to advise that they can apply for a Public Services Card (PSC) without a form of photo ID by attending an in-person interview at a PSC Registration Centre.</p></reply>

FBR staff have since processed 7,000 FBR applications while also continuing to provide support to Passport services due to the unprecedented levels of passport demand.</p><p>The FBR Service provides an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p><p>Supporting documentation for the application to which the Deputy has referred was received on 14 February 2020, and is due to be processed in the near future. A member of the FBR team will be in contact with the applicant in this regard. </p><p>The Passport Service has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand for passports and FBRs since June of last year. A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway over the past several months. This has seen the Passport Service take on over 400 staff since June 2021.</p><p>The unprecedented level of staff currently working in the Passport Service will be maintained in the months ahead.  This will allow for the reassignment of additional staff to the processing of FBR applications with the aim of significantly reducing turnaround times for these applications by the end of this year.</p></reply>

This is not an Irish requirement but may be a requirement of the country where an applicant wishes to wed. The requirements governing marriage can differ in each country and all applicants are asked to check with the civil registration office in the country of marriage before application.</p><p>As there are legal requirements and implications in marriage, all applications undergo due diligence checks - which is why people are required to submit their applications and supporting documentation at least four months in advance of the intended date of marriage. </p><p>The application referred to by the Deputy was a late application and is still being processed. The applicant will be contacted by the Department&rsquo;s Marriages Abroad Unit with a decision as soon as all necessary checks are complete.</p></reply>

This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs. This includes additional teaching and care supports. As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year.</p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year.</p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>In terms of Kildare, I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in primary and post-primary schools. Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years in this area to meet the demand for places.</p><p>NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond. There are specific plans in place to open additional special classes and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next.</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>A full list of special classes and special schools is available on the NCSE website: </p> <blockquote> 	ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NCSE-Special-School-Allocations-21-22-website-03-12-2021.pdfand <br /><br />ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Final-2021_2022-Sp-Class-list-25_03_22.pdf. </blockquote></reply>

All referrals to TESS are screened and prioritised for intervention by an Educational Welfare Officer (EWO). While referrals are primarily received from schools, parents and other professionals can also make a referral. The Educational Welfare service provides a service to all children, and does not specifically collate school refusal information for children with special education needs.</p>  <p>  TESS Educational Welfare Officers take a supportive welfare-based approach working with families and children in a child-centred way to overcome barriers to their school attendance, participation, and retention. They work closely with schools, educational support services and other agencies to support school attendance, this is done through home visits, educational welfare conferences and collaboratively working with different agencies. The main priority is to identify effective interventions and supports which will promote the engagement, attendance, and retention of the child/young person in school and to ensure their right to an education is protected.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education was set up to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children. The NCSE performs a number of roles in our educational system and key amongst these are the provision of supports to our schools to promote a continuum of educational provision, so as to ensure that what is delivered is inclusive and meets the needs of students with special educational needs. The NCSE plays a critical role in ensuring that policy and provision develops and evolves, so that students with special educational needs are helped to perform to their potential and achieve good education and life outcome.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides a casework service to schools through the assigned NEPS psychologist.  NEPS provides support for students at risk of educational disadvantage and those with special educational needs. NEPS supports the promotion of the wellbeing and good mental health for all students in schools.</p>  <p>  NEPS engage with reluctant attendance and emotional based school avoidance through their casework service, working with children and young people, parents/guardians and school staff. School refusal is a complex issue that often requires an integrated response from schools, parents, education partners (including TESS), and occasionally from other agencies in the child and family support sphere including the NCSE and the HSE.</p>  <p>  NEPS have developed a resource for parents/guardians  and for school staff on Managing Reluctant Attendance &amp;amp; School Avoidance Behaviour which is available on the gov.ie website.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.</p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p><p>The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p> <blockquote> 	a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools.<br /><br />b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process.<br /><br />c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes:  	i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation);<br /><br />ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools); and <br /><br />iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated) and the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term.  </blockquote>  <p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014 circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf. Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.</p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE at: ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The NCSE is continuing to engage with a number of schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes in the shortest possible timeframe. Every support is being made available to these schools, a number of which have building and refurbishment projects underway, with a particular focus on places becoming available in September next.</p><p>I can confirm that the schools specifically referenced by the Deputy are part of this ongoing NCSE engagement.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of increased special school provision generally with two new special schools opened in Carrigaline and Crumlin in the current school-year and further expansion planned in 2022/23 which Minister Foley and I were pleased to announce in March.</p><p>We have also secured funding for the opening of 287 new special classes from September next.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I would like to again assure the Deputy that every support will be made available to progress additional special class and school capacity, in the shortest possible timeframe, with a particular focus in Dublin on the 2022/23 school-year.</p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. The Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme with forty eight research projects at various stages including its joint SEAI partnership energy website project <i>www.energyineducation.ie</i>.</p><p>Solar PV is also funded for schools that are having their electrical installations replaced.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will also build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are involved in an energy efficient retrofit pathfinder scheme for schools since 2017. </p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. </p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland which will include solar PV. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 Annex of Actions published this year includes for the introduction of  interim regulations amending solar panel planning exemptions, with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations in Q1 2022 and once published will be considered by my Department.</p></reply>

My Department is currently in the process of establishing a working group to progress the recommendations of the Review of Out of School Education Provision.</p>  <p>  In 2021, both the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS) and this Department increased the allocation of co-operation hours to the centre from 2,886 hours to 6,000 hours. This represents an increase of over 107% in the level of hours to the Cork Life Centre. In addition Cork Life Centre receives annual funding of &euro;177,500 from my Department via Cork Education and Training Board. </p>  <p>  With regard to overall funding for out of school settings, the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in a centralised format. There are number of settings referenced in the Review of Out of School Education Provision report. Some are not funded by my Department. Some settings receive funding directly from my Department from a variety of sources (pay and non-pay), while others receive funding via Education and Training Boards. One of the tasks of the working group to be established will be to ascertain the funding currently received by settings, both directly and indirectly, with a view to understanding the funding required for such settings in order to ensure sustainability. </p>  <p>  Amongst the recommendations of the report is that &ldquo;This review finds positively on the work which is carried out in out-of-school settings and it is important to provide stability to this provision. It recommends that all settings be supported by state funding to ensure its stability. However, in order to receive funding, out-of-school settings should be required to meet set criteria in relation to the level of education provision, level of teaching, referrals process and overall governance&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The working group will be developing a framework in this regard. It is important to point out that the report refers to out of school provision across a range of settings which differ in context, student background, governance and range of provision. My Department and the working group will be engaging with the sector generally, including the Cork Life Centre, in the context of the work which will now follow the publication of the report. </p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation grant in future budgets.</p><p>My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, <i>www.spu.ie</i>.</p><p>Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.</p><p>All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website <i>www.energyineducation.ie</i>which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. </p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.</p><p>The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p><p>The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of  Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability. <i>www.energyineducation.ie</i>. Typically savings of between 5 to 10% are identified through low and no cost measures, while some schools participating have identified potential savings of up to 15 % or more.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist. </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of a new model of Special Education Teacher Allocation (SET model) to all Primary and Post Primary School in September 2017, additional supports for children with special educational needs are now embedded in all primary and post primary schools.  Schools allocate their Special Education Teaching and SNA supports based on need in the school setting, so that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner.  This replaced the previous model of support whereby children with more complex needs required a clinical diagnosis of a particular disorder in order to access Resource Teaching hours. The introduction of this new model means that pupils no longer have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access additional support in school.  Schools provide supports based on a Continuum of Support so that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner. </p>  <p>  NEPS&rsquo; psychologist numbers currently stand at 224.52 whole-time equivalent (WTE) posts, having grown from a base of 173 in 2014.  Any further expansion of the NEPS service will be considered as part of the estimates process for 2023.</p>  <p>  The School Inclusion Model (SIM) is based on policy advice from the National Council for Special Education based on the principle of providing the right support at the right time delivered by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill-sets. Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes. Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on extending the SIM. The project includes a number of elements:</p>  <p>  - Provision of in-school therapies (speech and language, occupational)</p>  <p>  - Allocation of SNAs on a front-loaded basis</p>  <p>  - Training of SNAs </p>  <p>  A demonstration project to provide in-school and preschool therapy services took place over the course of the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  The project was developed by the Department, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Department of Health, and the Health Service Executive and managed and co-ordinated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p>  <p>  The purpose of the project was to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports by providing speech and language and occupational therapy within &lsquo;educational settings&rsquo;. This innovative pilot complemented existing HSE funded provision of essential therapy services.  </p>  <p>  The project took place in the Health Service Executive (HSE) Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) 7 Region of South West Dublin, Kildare and West Wicklow. 75 schools (of which includes 22 schools that are in the DEIS programme), including a representative sample of primary, post-primary, and special schools took part. 75 preschool settings associated with primary schools participating in the project were included. In total 150 settings participated in the demonstration project. </p>  <p>  Children who require speech and language therapy services on a one-to-one basis continue to access services from the Health Service Executive. The in-school therapy model was designed to supplement, not to replace existing services.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Demonstration Project was to design a therapeutic support model for the school setting that would lead to better outcomes for the children.  It involved the development of a continuum of support, specialist, targeted and universal supports, in line with best practice for students.    </p>  <p>  The project was evaluated over the course of the 2018/19 school year and this was positively evaluated.</p>  <p>  In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CH07 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid-19 related work. It was then extended to the 2020/21 school year which has also been interrupted by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  </p>  <p>The Pilot has now recommenced in CHO7 and therapists are working within these schools and are providing ongoing support on a responsive basis to deliver therapy-based strategies and tools. Overall there is good engagement by the schools in CHO7. Planning for an expansion is under way. The Department is consulting with relevant Departments including the Department of An Taoiseach, Department of Health and the Department of  Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  </p></reply>

My Department signposts schools and students to the HSE-funded mental health services. The Department of Education also has an important role to play in supporting the well-being and mental health of our young people. The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting well-being in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of well-being and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs.  </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of the Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the well-being, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides its service to schools through casework and through support and development work for schools. This includes guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s well-being, social, emotional and academic development. Initiatives such as the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning Programmes and the FRIENDS Resilience Programmes. These programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  </p>  <p>  NEPS has developed a range of workshops on the promotion of well-being and resilience in schools which includes trauma informed approaches.  The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The workshops are available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with my colleague Minister Butler who has responsibility for Mental Health to explore how to support the well-being and mental health of children and young people.</p></reply>

Due the disruption to learning and cancellation of the summer 2020 and 2021 Junior Cycle examinations as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic it was not possible for students to engage with the final assessment component which is set by the State Examinations Commission until this year. The cohort of students currently taking Junior Cycle examinations are therefore the first to have engaged with the full range of learning and assessment experiences in line with the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish.  </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum redevelopment, the NCCA reviews the enactment of subject specifications by conducting interim reviews once each subject specification has been experienced across the three-year span of their Junior Cycle. The purpose of such reviews is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on their experiences of the new specifications. In February 2021, the NCCA opened a public consultation on draft L1 and L2 specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish. In response to subsequent stakeholder requests, the NCCA extended the timeline for this consultation and also undertook to conduct and early enactment review of the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. Accordingly, the NCCA commissioned Dublin City University to conduct this review which I am advised is expected to be completed later this year. The draft report, will in due course, be presented to NCCA Council for consideration.</p></reply>

A Career Break is a period of unpaid special leave for not less than 1 school year. It may be extended on an annual basis provided the total period of the Career Break does not exceed 5 years at any one time, subject to an overall maximum of 10 years absence during a teacher&rsquo;s career.</p>  <p>  Under the Career Break Scheme, a teacher may not be employed in an approved teaching or special needs assistant post funded by monies provided by the Oireachtas.  However, in exceptional circumstances, an employer may appoint a qualified teacher on Career Break for substitute teaching purposes subject to a maximum of (a) 90 days in a school year at primary level and (b) 300 hours in a school year at post primary level.</p>  <p>  The aforementioned substitute teaching restrictions were suspended in the 2021/22 school year and previous school years in response to issues raised in relation to teacher supply. Information Note TC 0015/2021 titled &rsquo;Temporary changes to the Career Break Scheme for Registered Teachers employed in Recognised Primary and Post Primary Schools-2021/22  School Year&rsquo; published in June 2021, informed employers and teachers of the temporary change to the Career Break Scheme for the 2021/22 school year.  As stated in the Information Note, this is a temporary change and will cease at the end of the 2021/2022 school year. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0038/2022, paragraph 6.1.1 (b) states the normal terms and conditions of the Career Break Scheme will apply for the 2022/23 school year as follows: </p>  <p>  (b) Career Break Scheme for teachers. </p>  <p>  The temporary arrangement to the Career Break Scheme under Information Note TC 0015/2021, permitting a teacher on Career Break to carry out unlimited substitute work, will cease at the end of the 2021/22 school year. Therefore, the normal terms and conditions of the Career Break Scheme (paragraph 8) under Circular 54/2019 will apply for the 2022/23 school year where limited substitute work is permitted. </p>  <p>  The Department of Expenditure and Public Reform determines the terms and conditions of the Career Break Scheme for public servants, which includes teachers.</p>  <p>  Under Section 24 of the Education Act 1998, the Minister for Education, with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform (DPER), is authorised to determine the terms and conditions of employment for teachers employed in approved teaching posts funded by monies provided by the Oireachtas. The Teachers Conciliation Council (TCC) forms part of the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers, the purpose of which is to provide a forum for claims and proposals relating to the salary, and other terms &amp;amp; conditions of service for teachers. The Council is comprised of representatives from the Teacher Unions, the School Management Bodies, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Education. The TCC is independently chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission. The terms and conditions of teachers employed in State funded teaching posts are formulated at TCC and are of general application to all teachers appointed to such posts. The Career Break Scheme exists by virtue of a collective agreement, concluded under the auspices of the TCC. </p>  <p>  My Department will keep the position under review in the 2022/23 school year, having regard to the recruitment of substitute teachers.</p></reply>

The project focuses on transitions from school for young people with complex needs.  The aim of the project is to develop and demonstrate an approach to transitions for young people with disabilities to improve access to, and opportunities for, post-school options. </p></reply>

This service is available on MyWelfare.ie and 15,000 people have renewed their PSC online so far this year.</p><p>It is important to note that holders of expired free travel PSCs have at all times retained their entitlement to free travel.  For this reason, there is an interim arrangement in place with the National Transport Authority, whereby expired free travel cards are accepted for travel on public transport services.  Expired PSCs can also continue to be used to collect social welfare payments in Post Offices nationwide, and to verify MyGovID accounts. </p><p>The Department is currently reviewing the issuing of PSC expiry notifications with the aim of making the notification process more efficient. Any decision as to the resumption of the issuing of expiry notifications will be taken within the context of the Department&rsquo;s available resources and the ongoing requirements to comply with the prevailing HSE and WHO public health and social distancing guidelines.</p></reply>

As a consequence, Minister Humphreys and I announced wide-ranging reforms to schemes last December. One of the changes introduced means that all persons over 60 years of age can now stay on CE until reaching retirement age. </p><p>Along with this, in order to assist with the increased turnover of participants and the potential impact on services, CE participants whose contract term is coming to an end are permitted to stay on CE until a replacement is found. Approximately 600 participants have had their contracts extended on this basis since the start of April.</p><p>Both Minister Humphreys and I are very aware of the ongoing challenges faced by CE, with the increased numbers of participants leaving schemes on the expiry of contracts, which were extended on a number of occasions during COVID.  Coupled with the very welcome low levels of unemployment, post COVID, this means that some schemes are still facing challenges in filling vacancies.  We are currently examining a further set of proposals to support CE schemes, during this period, by improving the recruitment and referral process, extending eligibility to new cohorts, and reducing the level of turnover on some schemes. The intention is to bring these to Government shortly.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.  <b></b></p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007. </p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation - each year moving forward on key reforms, with the obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments and requirements.</p>  <p>  I recognise the importance of the Optional Protocol to the UNCRPD. As the Deputy will be aware, the Optional Protocol is an international treaty that establishes procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the Convention. Ratification of the Optional Protocol is a commitment in the Programme for Government, following the State's first review period before the UN Committee. </p>  <p>  Due to delays at UN level, Ireland&rsquo;s appearance before the Committee will be delayed, possibly for some time. In light of this, both Minister O'Gorman and I have indicated that we are open to earlier ratification, contingent on the State being in a position to meet its obligations thereunder. This is reflective of the State&rsquo;s long-standing approach to entering into binding international obligations in good faith, and at a point where the State is in a position to meet its obligations.</p>  <p>In that regard, we know that commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is required before ratification can occur, and for closer alignment with Article 12 of the Convention. It is intended that this important legal reform will be in place once the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill is passed into law.</p>  <p>  Alongside that, ratification of the Optional Protocol requires a comprehensive review of existing domestic remedies for breaches of the Convention in order to ensure the State can meet the obligations arising from the Optional Protocol. My Department is currently in the process of examining the requirements for ratification, and my officials have had engagement with our internal legal advisors on the steps required. This work is being progressed as part of the development of the UNCRPD Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at Irish ports, including airports.</p>  <p>  Tusla has a significant role, as part of the State&rsquo;s overall response, to support individuals, particularly women and children, displaced from Ukraine, as a result of the war and coming into Ireland. Tusla is committed to balancing the needs of families in a humanitarian crisis, with its child protection responsibilities, and requirement to support families and promote the welfare of children. </p>  <p>  Unaccompanied children, who arrive at ports of entry to Ireland, are referred to Tusla for a child protection needs assessment. In the first instance, Tusla makes every attempt to contact relatives of the child and to reunite the child with family members or friends. If children cannot be reunified with family or friends, they are either  received into the State care, or, if older and in line with their needs, are fully supported by Tusla in having an appropriate placement, education and other assistance. </p>  <p>  Young people in care, and those being supported by Tusla, are placed by Tusla either in small specialist residential care centres, or with specifically recruited foster families under a F&aacute;ilte Foster care programme.  Social Workers and social care workers are allocated to support and monitor the progress of the child / young person. The care plan may involve specialist English language tuition, intensive educational supports and therapeutic work in respect of trauma.</p>  <p>  Children who arrive in Ireland outside of a dedicated refugee programme are supported in their application for refugee status.</p>  <p>  Assisting children with reunification with their families has evolved as a key piece of the support social workers provide to those who are eligible to apply.  Where relevant the process of reunification is started as soon as the children come to the attention of Tusla.  </p>  <p>  All Ukrainian citizens and third country nationals living in the Ukraine who seek international protection in Ireland will receive temporary protection status. This includes unaccompanied and separated children.</p>  <p>  From January 2022 to date, 340 unaccompanied minors were referred to Tusla of which 161 where from Ukraine.  Currently, 164 unaccompanied minors, of which 66 are Ukrainian, are in State care / accommodation. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is seeking further statistical information on the numbers of unaccompanied minors in care / accommodation. In that regard, and as it is an operational matter for Tusla, I have requested that Tusla provide a direct response to the Deputy in this instance.</p></reply>

A recent review of the NCS showed that:</p>  <p>  - 38% families had more than half of their early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS;</p>  <p>  - 56% families had more money to spend due to the scheme; and</p>  <p>  - 28% families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it. </p>  <p>  NCS operates year round and can vary the level of subsidy in line with differing parental needs for early learning and childcare at different points of the year. </p>  <p>  I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability and sustainability.</p>  <p>  An Expert Group to develop a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector made recommendations to Government in December which were accepted in full. This new funding model is now beginning to be implemented to improve quality, affordability, sustainability and accessibility of services.</p>  <p>  The package of measures for the sector announced in Budget 2022 was informed by the Expert Group recommendations. The package includes a new Core Funding stream valued at up to &euro;221 million in a full year. Making early learning and childcare more affordable to parents and improving services' sustainability are central objectives of Core Funding, along with improving quality including through better terms and conditions for the workforce. </p>  <p>  A central condition of Core Funding will be that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also extended universal NCS subsidies for children of all ages up to 15.  This change will come into effect from August.  It also changed how &lsquo;wraparound hours&rsquo; for NCS subsidies are determined and this is already in effect. The Expert Group report also recommended increasing the NCS rates and this will also be implemented for future years.  </p>  <p>  Ensuring no fee increase, in tandem with developments to the NCS, will together deliver improved affordability for parents.  </p>  <p>  In terms of costs for services, Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. Core Funding will be allocated based largely on capacity. Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. </p>  <p>  Since August 2020, early learning and childcare services had been able to access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) without having to demonstrate a reduction in turnover. This continued to be available until the end of April. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years and that providers have continued to be sustainable.</p>  <p>  Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund is available to providers. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. I am delighted to report that so far 94% of services have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into contract for the Transition Fund. </p>  <p>  The Transition Fund is designed to support the stability and sustainability of services in the interim period between the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and ahead of the introduction of the new Core Funding Scheme in September 2022.</p>  <p>  As you can see, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years.</p></reply>

The Office will have responsibility for all aspects of the management, oversight, and development of the apprenticeship system and for implementing the Action Plan. Under this plan the NAO will exercise the relevant functions of SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority (HEA).</p>  <p>  This represents a significant structural reform in the positioning and delivery of apprenticeship into the future. It will allow for responsive delivery of collaborative learning opportunities supported by industry and the further and higher education and training sector, and provide the essential basis for significant expansion of the system.</p>  <p>  With its first Director having now been appointed, the NAO will deliver additional practical supports and information for employers and apprentices seeking to engage with apprenticeship. The staffing structure of the office and budget for 2022 have been agreed and early achievements include overseeing the introduction the new &euro;2000 employer grant, the &euro;2666 gender based bursary, and the establishment of the NAA.</p>  <p>  Traffic on apprenticeship.ie has also increased as a direct result of the inclusion of apprenticeship options on the CAO website from November 2021, with over 30,000 click-throughs from the CAO site.</p>  <p>  In tandem with these actions, the apprenticeship agenda is being promoted on an ongoing basis through Generation Apprenticeship. This is a national campaign to drive awareness of apprenticeship opportunities across a broad audience of stakeholders (radio, digital, billboard). The campaigns promote a number of key initiatives under the Generation Apprenticeship banner, targeting the employer audience regarding the Gender Bursary and Employer Grant, and targeting students, parents, and guidance counsellors regarding opportunities in apprenticeship. Award ceremonies for both the employer and apprentice of the year will take place instilling pride &amp;amp; confidence in apprenticeship achievements in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The NAO Director is currently providing the leadership required to address the next stage of the NAO&rsquo;s development, including finalising a work programme for 2022 and the development and implementation of solid governance and financial arrangements, aligned with the Action Plan, in consultation with SOLAS, the HEA, my Department and other key partners. A sum of &euro;1 million has been allocated in Budget 2022 for the first year of the NAO&rsquo;s operation.</p></reply>

The Government has decided that income contingent loans will not form part of the future funding model. </p>  <p>  Instead, the Government is committing to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund and student contribution.  It is also my intention that in response to the cost of education and living, a reduced reliance on student contributions will be a feature of future reforms.</p>  <p>  The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our commitment to addressing legacy issues in higher education and detailing our ambitious plans for investment and reform. This includes:</p>  <p>  - planned additional investment of &euro;307 million to address core funding challenges for our institutions, that will be made over a number of years through annual budgetary processes. This does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education.</p>  <p>  - plans to consider options to address cost as a barrier to higher education, and how we will pursue funding measures on these issues through the Estimates process, including in respect of reductions to the student contribution and enhancements to the SUSI grant in line with the Student Grant Review.</p>  <p>  Additional detail is available on the gov.ie website at the following location: gov.ie/en/policy-information/49e56-future-funding-in-higher-education/</p></reply>

Its introduction means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices will now have access to financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through this employer grant. In this way, employers of all apprentices will have some of the cost of the apprenticeship defrayed, promoting engagement with the non-craft programmes and balancing Government priorities in terms of meeting strategic skills needs through targeted interventions. It will also encourage more employers to engage with a wider range of apprenticeships and help to encourage the development of new programmes.</p><p>The Employer Grant provides financial support from the State to apprentice employers of one of the 40 apprenticeships that have been established since 2016 and do not attract payment of off-the-job training allowances.</p><p>The grant was officially launched on the 26 May 2022. Eligible employers were invited by email to apply for the grant via an online portal system. With social media, TV, and radio campaigns planned and launched to promote the grant, it is anticipated that a high level of applications will be made.</p><p>As of June 16 2022;</p><p>- 70 employer applications with 126 eligible apprentices have been received </p><p>- 30 employer applications with  46 eligible apprentices have been paid</p><p>Further details of claims per apprenticeship programme and associated percentages are included in tabular form in the attached table.</p></reply>

This recommendation was made in March 2020 at the onset of the pandemic and consequently the Department's ability and capacity to develop a full response and engage on the issue was constrained by pressure of work arising from the public health emergency and the establishment of the Department during that period at which time responsibility for the claim transferred.</p>  <p>  The Sectoral Bargaining Fund under Building Momentum is to deal with outstanding issues within the terms of the Fund and within the Exchequer funding limit in place.

Ireland is a State Party to the Rome Statute and a strong supporter of the ICC as the cornerstone of a system of international criminal justice. The ICC currently exercises jurisdiction over crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide and the crime of aggression.</p>  <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has informed me of the initiative launched in June 2021 by the Independent Expert Panel for the Legal Definition of Ecocide  . The Independent Expert Panel proposal provides a new definition of the crime of ecocide, which seeks to serve as the basis for consideration of an amendment to the Rome Statute of the ICC. The purpose of such an amendment would be to include ecocide as a new crime under the jurisdiction of the Court.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Department of Foreign Affairs that the proposal to agree a legal definition of ecocide and to subsequently include it as a new international crime in the Rome Statute is still at its early stages and will require careful consideration and analysis. The Department of Foreign Affairs officials continue to engage in discussions on the important implications of this proposal with international partners, both within the EU and with other fellow States Parties to the Rome Statute.</p>  <p>  As with all proposed amendments to the Rome Statute, it is for States Parties individually to assess the merits of the proposal in the first instance. If there is sufficient support among States Parties for an agreed definition of ecocide, a formal amendment can be considered by the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute.

In recent months we have seen vicious crimes take place. These types of attacks cannot, and will not, be tolerated.</p>  <p>  We live in a diverse and welcoming country and our laws and values should reflect this. I will as soon as possible, subject to Government approval, publish the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill to  legislate against hate crime and hate speech and help ensure that Ireland is safe, fair and inclusive for all. </p>  <p>  The Bill will strengthen the law around hate crime by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.  The protected characteristics under the Hate Crime Bill include sexual orientation and gender. </p>  <p>  Aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime. </p>  <p>  I'm informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) forms part of the Garda Community Relations Bureau and has a very positive working relationship with minority communities in Ireland.   </p>  <p>  The Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy is externally focused on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s relations with the communities that it serves, delivering on the obligations on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to human rights and equality under Irish, EU law and international conventions. </p>  <p>  Under the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working to significantly increase reporting of hate crimes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by members of the LGBTI+ community owing to the more open relationship that has been developed.</p>  <p>   I am further informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented a number of specific operations in Dublin City aimed at addressing anti-social activity.  The operations involve increased uniform and plain clothes proactive patrolling of the city, with a particular emphasis on the city centre. </p>  <p>  Operation Citizen, established in November 2021, is a co-ordinated approach involving Garda&iacute; from both Dublin Metropolitan Region South Central and North Central with an emphasis on providing high-visibility policing in the city centre to provide reassurance to the public and proactively tackle incidents of anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that, as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ongoing national response to hate crime, the GNDIU provides assurance to members of the public in relation to reports of hate-based occurrences. This includes daily monitoring of all recorded hate crimes / incidents on PULSE and social media, advising investigating members, supporting investigations and providing assurance to victims and their communities. </p>  <p>  A new, non-emergency online hate crime reporting mechanism was launched by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2021 to improve accessibility to the Garda service for victims of all types of hate crime. It is available via the garda.ie website and provides a safe and secure environment for victims, who may previously have been reluctant to report in person to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

While this harm can never be fully undone, I am strongly committed to bringing to Government and publishing a scheme to disregard convictions for qualifying offences prior to decriminalisation in 1993.</p>  <p>  The Working Group consists of representatives from my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC), the Office of the Attorney General and three members of the LGBTI+ community with expertise in this area. </p>  <p>  The report identifies progress made by the group to date on a number of key issues, as well as proposed next steps. Some of these key issues include identifying appropriate records, what happens to records, criteria for a conviction to be eligible for a disregard, and offences to be included under the disregard scheme.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the proposed public consultation is to allow representative organisations and affected people to provide input, based on their lived experience, on a number of key issues identified by the Working Group as requiring further input from affected communities, which will inform the Group&rsquo;s final deliberations, and ensure more effective policy-making and implementation.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Progress Report in May, work has been ongoing to progress all of the next steps in the report including the development of resources to enable an effective and accessible public consultation. </p>  <p>  The public consultation will be launched this summer. As set out in Justice Plan 2022, the final report of the Working Group is scheduled for submission to me by the end of Q3 2022, subject to the conclusion and outcome of the consultation process.</p></reply>

In recent months we have seen vicious crimes take place. These types of attacks cannot, and will not, be tolerated.</p><p>  We live in a diverse and welcoming country and our laws and values should reflect this. In the coming period I will publish, subject to Government approval, the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill which will legislate against hate crime and hate speech and help to ensure that Ireland is safe, fair and inclusive for all.</p><p>  The Bill will strengthen the law around hate crime by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.</p><p>The protected characteristics under the Hate Crime Bill include sexual orientation and gender.</p><p>  Aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.</p><p>  I am advised by Garda authorities at the Garda National Protective Services Bureau that they are not in a position to provide comment in respect of the statistics supplied as they are not in a position to verify the source or accuracy of this data.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are aware that persons who work in the sex trade, whether they identify as transgender or not, may be subject to attacks. </p><p>  In addressing this, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na employs a victim-focused approach. Personnel assigned to the Organised Prostitution Investigation Unit (OPIU), within the Garda National Protective Service Bureau (GNPSB), maintain regular contact with many Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO&rsquo;s), who work with persons in the sex trade.  </p><p>  The OPIU also conduct regular safeguarding checks with persons who work in the sex trade, in addition to investigating criminal matters suffered by victim of crime, who work in the sex trade, regardless of their gender identity.</p><p>  Regarding the recording of violent assault incidents by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where a person is a victim of a violent assault, I am further advised that the PULSE system does not specifically record whether the victim works in the sex trade or any other activity. </p><p>  Also, the PULSE system does not record the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity, other than male or female, unless there is prima facia evidence that the assault may be considered a &lsquo;hate crime&rsquo; and motivated by discrimination. </p><p>  In such circumstances, the incident is given the additional designation of &lsquo;hate crime&rsquo; and the appropriate &lsquo;Discriminatory Motive&rsquo; section is completed, which identifies age, disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or gender as a motive.</p></reply>

The consultation, which ran until 21 January this year, looked at how best to update the existing laws governing the sale and regulation of alcohol in Ireland. Members of the public, academics, sectoral groups, and representative organisations were invited to complete an online survey and/or make a written submission to my Department.</p><p>There was a high level of response to the consultation, with in excess of 5,000 responses received. My Department is now reviewing these responses to ensure the reform of the legislation takes account of and is informed by this engagement.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that, on 10 March, I hosted a consultation webinar and panel discussion event on the reform of the alcohol licensing laws to give an opportunity for further discussion of the issues of concern to stakeholders.</p><p>That webinar can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s YouTube channel via the following link: www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tMtKzd_9jA.</p><p>It is intended to progress this legislation in the months ahead. Submissions from stakeholders will of course be carefully considered in the context of publication of the forthcoming Bill. Details of the proposed reform will be included in the General Scheme when published.</p></reply>

In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p>  <p>  It is open to the applicant to contact the Citizenship Division of my Department at citizenshipinfo@justice.ie at any time for an update on their application.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

A further 393 people have been granted an equivalent permission by the International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department, under either the Permission to Remain (first instance) or Permission to Remain Review processes, before their applications under the scheme had been finalised.</p><p>My Department opened the once-in-a generation scheme for the Regularisation of Long Term Undocumented Migrants in the State on 31 January 2022 for a six month period to the 31 July 2022. The scheme is designed, following detailed engagement with the people affected, to give long-term undocumented people without a current immigration permission the chance to regularise their status, access the labour market and begin their path to citizenship.</p><p>The scheme genuinely is a once-off, life-changing opportunity to obtain status in the State. I encourage everyone eligible for the scheme, who has not yet made an application, to do so before the closing date. I can assure people that we are examining applications pragmatically and humanely and we are considering all viable proofs of residence.</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of someone who might be eligible for the scheme please encourage them to come forward. Applicants will be supported in a positive way and if they are not eligible for the scheme, other immigration options can be explored. </p><p>To publicise the scheme, my Department commenced a targeted social media ad campaign across all of the main social media platforms directed at the top ten nationalities eligible under the scheme in their own native languages. This campaign will run until the scheme closes at the end of July. Further targeted communications are also being rolled out in physical locations, such as supermarkets and on bus shelters in locations around the country. </p><p>Full details regarding the qualifying criteria, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document and the required documentation for the scheme is available on my Department's immigration services website at: www.irishimmigration.ie/regularisation-of-long-term-undocumented-migrant-scheme/. </p><p>The international protection strand is open for applications until 7 August 2022, and full details of the scheme is available at: www.ipo.gov.ie. </p></reply>

This includes in relation to first-time registrations and renewals, and processes and procedures are in place to allow customers to do so. </p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, at the Registration Office Burgh Quay, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 741 741) was introduced for customers. The current operating hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday and all appointments for Dublin based customers to register their immigration permission for the first time are now issued through this service. Operators offer one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group.</p><p>To date, the service has provided 27,428 appointments with a further 7,499 appointments booked to early August. Applications are currently being processed on a seven days a week basis.</p><p>Dublin based customers who are seeking to renew their permission can continue to do so online at: inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login. Since its introduction in July 2020, the online renewal process has completed approximately 138,000 applications.  </p><p>Customers wishing to renew an immigration permission may apply online up to 12 weeks in advance of their current permission&rsquo;s expiration date.  Current processing times are longer than usual because of extremely high demand.  The Registration Office is working to process renewals as quickly as possible. I have significantly increased staff capacity to process the applications on hand. Staff are supporting customers who have travel plans in place through the customer service helpdesk. Customers are asked to email my Department at immigrationsupport@justice.ie  putting &lsquo;Flights booked for Travel&rsquo; in the subject box. Customers should also include proof of paid flights in their name so that these applications can be prioritised. </p><p>My Department's Registration Office customer service team is also available to support customers who may have language difficulties or who may need assistance with translation. A number of multi-lingual videos describing the registration process and what to expect are available on my Department's website www.irishimmigration.ie. </p><p>My Department's Registration Office in Burgh Quay is responsible for registering immigration permissions for customers residing in the Dublin area only. First time registrations and renewals for customers outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network. The allocation of appointments with GNIB is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in the Bureau&rsquo;s operations.</p><p>I am advised that there was one expert consultant engaged for the provision of expert evidence in a legal case in 2021.  This was on a stand-alone basis and the consultant was not on a retainer.  </p><p>CAB also engaged the services of one Quantity Surveyor in 2021 and the services of two Quantity Surveyors in 2022, to date, to provide expert services in CAB investigations.  None of these Surveyors were engaged on a retainer.</p><p>As CAB&rsquo;s statutory remit extends to civil asset recovery and not criminal investigations I am advised that the Bureau does not routinely secure convictions. Arising from the foregoing, any convictions secured by the Bureau are generally incidental to the primary aim of which is to deny and deprive persons of the benefit of assets which are derived from criminal conduct. I am advised that the Bureau has secured two such incidental convictions in the time period covered by this Parliamentary Question, both of which were for drugs offences.</p></reply>

Additionally, Justice Plan 2022 commits to continuing the work already commenced by my Department to establish a Gambling Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  To give effect to this commitment, work is underway on the Gambling Regulation Bill, which was approved by Government for priority drafting and publication. </p>  <p>  The Bill is based on the recommendations of both the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling and the Final Report on the establishment of a modern regulatory environment and authority for all gambling activities licensed in Ireland. Copies of both reports can be found on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  In respect of loot boxes and similar e-Commerce activities, the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group noted that the video gaming industry should play a greater role in ensuring that their intellectual property was not used outside the games for &ldquo;gambling purposes&rdquo; facilitated by third party websites and that the video gaming industry should treat this issue similarly to how they combatted counterfeiting previously.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland supported the 2018 Declaration by the Gaming Regulators European Forum that video gaming products should be licensed and regulated appropriately, if they can be shown to fall into the category of gambling. In preparing the Declaration, member states were aware of reports that third party actors, not authorised by the video game developer or under their control, may seek to commercialise certain elements of video gaming in a manner akin to gambling. The issue is whether such micro-transactions constitute gambling or are a form of e-commerce.  </p>  <p>  With regard to protection of children and young people, the Pan-European Game Information (PEGI) age rating system was established in 2003 to help European parents make informed decisions on buying computer games. I encourage parents to ensure that their children only engage in appropriate gaming and are not making purchases unknown to them.</p>  <p>  Different approaches have been adopted to the issue of whether and how "loot boxes" might be defined and regulated in the context of gambling activities in Europe, with no definitive outcomes or consensus as to how to address them.</p>  <p>  The Gambling Regulatory Authority, when established, will have responsibility to keep this issue and other trends related to gambling under review.</p></reply>

There has been a clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises.</p>  <p>  For example, during the pandemic, Government established the Nursing Home Expert Panel which examined and advised on the COVID-19 response in long-term residential healthcare settings.</p>  <p>  The establishment of an enquiry or review into the State's response to the COVID-19 pandemic would be a matter for Government.  </p>  <p>  I wish to underline that Government has demonstrated that it values the efforts of the general public, volunteers and all workers during the pandemic. In recognition thereof and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to COVID-19, the Government held a National Day of Recognition and Commemoration on 18 March of this year. Furthermore, an additional permanent public holiday will be in place from 2023.

However, Section 39 organisations, along with paid staff in projects funded under grant aid from the State, are privately owned and run, and staff in these organisations are not public servants. Their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee. </p>  <p>  While certain Section 39 organisations received pay restoration, this was applicable to Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. Eligible Section 39 organisations included only agencies that had service arrangements in place back in 2013 and that were still under service arrangements in 2019. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included.  </p>  <p>  An agreement was reached at the WRC in October 2018, in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed by 50 agencies only. Pay restoration commenced in April 2019.  Any outstanding balance was paid in 2020 and 2021. A further WRC engagement followed in December 2020 in relation to a final phase of 250 organisations who were identified as part of the earlier agreement. A payment arrangement consisting of three phases was agreed with the first two payments to be made in 2021, and the third and final payment due to be made in 2023.</p>  <p>  Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those Section 39 organisations included in the initial WRC agreement. There is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and the process has reached a final resolution. </p></reply>
