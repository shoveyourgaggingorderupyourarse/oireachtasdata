At that time there were almost 200 classes of craft apprentices undertaking practical training and assessment in Education and Training Boards (ETBs), Institutes of Technology (IoTs) and TU Dublin.</p>  <p>  Where possible, theory assessments have been completed remotely.  Revision and assessment for approximately 950 apprentices who have yet to complete practical assessments is now scheduled to take place before the end of September.   </p>  <p>  Apprentices who had their off-the-job training interrupted in March are being recalled on a rolling basis to complete their period of off-the-job training and assessment. Letters have also issued to those apprentices due to commence training in TU Dublin and the IoTs at the end of September. </p>  <p>  Apprentices who are waiting for off-the-job training to start will be called in order of length of time waiting as soon as places become available.</p>  <p>  Due to Covid-19 social distancing guidelines class numbers have been reduced in many locations. SOLAS and the education providers are working to maximise the number of places that can be delivered safely. </p>  <p>  In general, consortia led apprenticeships are delivered on a more flexible basis than craft apprenticeships, with off-the-job training delivered for example on a day per week basis or through blended learning.  The majority of these apprenticeships continued with off-the-job training delivered remotely during lockdown, and this is likely to continue. </p>  <p>  The Government is very committed to ensuring that apprenticeships play an enhanced role in the training and development of young people.  A new Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme has been introduced to encourage employers to take on apprentices and a new Apprenticeship Action Plan is under development.</p></reply>

Over 16,700 laptops have already been procured as part of a bulk order organised by HEAnet, while additional devices are being procured by some providers directly. </p>  <p>  The higher and further education providers will determine which individual students should be prioritised to receive a device on a needs basis and within the terms and conditions of the grant. Students in counties Cavan and Monaghan who wish to apply for a device should contact the relevant higher education institution or ETB for further information.</p></reply>

The scheme provides for different levels of maintenance support, depending on means.  Grants are also provided at adjacent and non-adjacent rates and there are provisions for a number of income disregards.  The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the student grant scheme, Family Income Supplement (also known as the Working Family Payment) is treated as an income disregard and is therefore not included in the calculation of reckonable income. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, unlike other social protection payments which are paid to individuals, the Working Family Payment is a payment deemed to be paid to a family. In recognition of this, the SUSI scheme contains provisions which allow this payment to be recognised for the purposes of meeting the eligibility criteria for the special rate of grant, which is the highest maintenance grant support available.  </p>  <p>  This ensures that those students most in need receive supports commensurate with their needs. In this regard, SUSI has advised that 5,090 students qualified for the special rate of grant in 2019/20 by virtue of having a Working Family Payment. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

The student contribution charge covers the cost of elements such as student registration, admissions and examination fees. However, repeat examination fees are charged separately being set by the individual institution concerned and as Minister I have no function in this regard. </p>  <p>   However, I have received correspondence from a number of students in NUI Galway for whom paying &euro;295 to repeat an exam constitutes real financial hardship, and is a source of considerable distress. In light of the significant pressures placed upon students by Covid-19, I understand that a number of HEIs have already on an individual basis decided to waive the payment of such fees and I believe that where possible HEIs need to show, and have shown,  some degree of flexibility in this matter.</p>  <p>   In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and I fully acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways.  As such, I have written recently to NUI Galway and asked the institution to consider whether it can show such responsiveness in relation to it&rsquo;s policy regarding repeat examination fees.</p></reply>

This package of funding was developed following detailed engagement with the sector. </p>  <p>  Last week the Government approved an increase of 1,250 in the overall number of CAO places offered on certain high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions for the academic year 2020/21. The extra places are focused on high-demand programmes that traditionally attract students across a range of CAO points levels, and this will a have a cascade effect, creating greater capacity in lower demand courses. </p>  <p>  This is in addition to funding provided in order to address the demographic challenge in particular skills priority areas in higher education in Budget 2020, where an additional 4,000 places funded through exchequer funding and Human Capital Initiative places.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore this pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on younger workers and those in lower paid occupations with lower level of educational qualifications. In the July Stimulus Package funding for the tertiary education and training system to help support upskilling and reskilling amounts to &euro;100m and will fund over 35,000 places in the current year. This comprises of &euro;47.5m in additional higher education funding enabling an increase of 7,150 places and a provision of &euro;52.5m for an additional 28,550 places in the Further Education and Training sector this year.</p></reply>

Membership of leading international research organisations is an important mechanism for facilitating this engagement. </p>  <p>  For this reason, the Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 to initiate discussions with several international research organisations. Four organisations were identified &ndash; CERN, the European Southern Observatory, ELIXIR and LOFAR - and membership of three of these organisations has been completed. Ireland continues its consideration of CERN membership.</p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan 2018-2027, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government outlined its intention to review Ireland's membership of CERN. This will generate opportunities not only for Irish enterprise but also for its research community. While the benefits of CERN membership are recognised as significant, the cost is also significant and must be assessed in the context of other Departmental and national investment priorities.</p>  <p>  Following the recent government formation, CERN membership will now be considered in the context of the new Programme for Government and the establishment of my new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. Ireland continues its consideration of full and associate CERN membership and my Department will remain in contact with CERN officials.</p></reply>

The State pays the contribution in full or part for an estimated 44 per cent of all students eligible for free fees funding through SUSI. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government undertakes to provide a long term sustainable funding model for higher education.  In addition, I intend that the range of student supports operated by SUSI will be subject to a full review. An important objective will be to ensure access to and continued participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds. </p>  <p>  In relation to the preparation underway for the new academic year in the context of the Covid pandemic, Higher Education Institutions have been undertaking detailed planning and contingencies for re-opening and communicating these to students and learners. In the interest of the public health of students, staff and communities, this will entail blended learning, combining both online and onsite provision. </p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions have published their academic calendars, with information on the dates for orientation and the beginning of teaching for the autumn semester. Most have indicated in broad terms the balance of time for students between on-campus and online learning. I have highlighted the requirement for all institutions to provide clarity to their students as soon as possible and to prioritise the overall student experience consistent with public health advice.</p>  <p>  The delivery of further and higher education in the context of Covid-19 will cost the providers more not less.  The Government has provided additional funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education.  Since the student contribution is an important source of revenue for higher education it is not possible to abolish student contribution fees.  However additional funding being provided for student supports will be of assistance to many students particularly those with the least financial resources. </p>  <p>  Some &euro;10m in additional funding is being provided for improved supports for students. Most of this money will be used to top up the Student Assistance Fund, with remaining funding used to support students via the access services in the higher education institutions.

This includes circa &euro;350m on student grants and related activities, which is expected to benefit over 70,000 further and higher education students </p>  <p>  I recently announced details of a &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This includes &euro;15m in IT equipment grants for disadvantaged students in further and higher education and a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. An additional &euro;3m has also been provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives. </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme contains a number of qualifying thresholds for various grant values. These gradations allow students just over a threshold margin, to remain in receipt of a grant, albeit at a reduced rate that reflects their relative income vis-&agrave;-vis other applicants.  </p>  <p>  The scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p>  <p>  With regard to the income threshold for the special rate of grant, this is adjusted in line with Budget increases to the State Contributory Pension plus the maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years. For 2020, the threshold has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500. Last year over 21,000 students received the special rate of grant and it is anticipated that a similar number will qualify for supports in 2020. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains an important commitment to review SUSI eligibility and I fully intend to fulfil this commitment so as to promote access to third level, particularly amongst families with low incomes and communities that are under-represented.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including the separate residency and nationality/citizenship requirements of the scheme. Persons in the asylum application process that do not hold the required permissions as granted by the Minister for Justice are not eligible to access the Free Fees Initiative. </p>  <p>  Where students do not qualify for free fees funding, they are due to pay the appropriate fee, either EU or Non-EU, as determined by each higher education institution. These institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees scheme is a matter for the relevant institution to determine in accordance with their own criteria; the Department therefore has no role in the decision.</p>  <p>  An administratively based Student Support Scheme for Asylum Seekers is currently in operation in my Department which provides supports along similar lines to the SUSI grant scheme.  This scheme was introduced in 2015  and is available to persons who are either:</p>  <p>  - asylum applicants; or</p>  <p>  - subsidiary protection applicants; or</p>  <p>  - leave to remain applicants.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the 2019 scheme, I announced in August a liberalisation of the rules and the objective to have the scheme placed on a long term footing.  The requirement for prospective applications to have attended three academic years in the Irish school system and to have obtained the Leaving Certificate in the State, will no longer be required. Prospective applicants will, however, still have to meet the requirement to have been in the protection or leave to remain process for three years.</p>  <p>  I believe these measures will represent an important step in supporting asylum seekers in participating in higher education.</p></reply>

The State pays the contribution in full or part for an estimated 44 per cent of all students eligible for free fees funding through SUSI. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that an abolition of the student contribution would require additional state funding of &euro;242 million per annum, which is the estimated net cost to the Exchequer factoring in the subsequent estimated reduction in the SUSI Student Grant budget.   The costs for the Exchequer of reducing or abolishing the student contribution would increase in line with the demographic increases expected in the coming years up to 2030. </p>  <p>  I have acknowledged that the current rate is too high and a reduction of the rate will be considered over the lifetime of the Government.

Pre-existing apprenticeships were reviewed and renewed and the introduction of a new model of apprenticeship has resulted in the development of 33 new consortia-led apprenticeship programmes delivered in innovative ways across all sectors of the economy.  The first doctorate-level apprenticeship was launched recently and 20 further programmes are in development at various levels of the National Framework of Qualifications.</p><p>This expansion has been overseen by the enterprise-led Apprenticeship Council.  The Council made structured calls for proposals for new apprenticeships in 2015 and 2017 and now accept submissions on a continuous basis. </p><p>Looking forward, the Government has set a target of 10,000 new apprentice registrations per annum by 2025.  This compares against 6,177 registrations in 2019 and achieving this target will require significant focus in the Covid and post-Covid environment.

In recent years the Irish Research Council and Science Foundation Ireland has launched a number of initiatives to bring researchers closer to Government. </p>  <p>  In July 2018 the Irish Research Council launched its Oireachtas Shadowing Scheme. The scheme sees some of Ireland&rsquo;s most prominent researchers &lsquo;shadowing&rsquo; members of the Oireachtas for the day in Leinster House. The scheme was developed by the Council to bridge the divide between policy-making and research and to ensure that elected representatives are supported to tap into publicly funded research. The scheme pairs a Council funded researcher with a member of the Oireachtas. The scheme is an excellent opportunity for researchers to deepen their understanding of political engagement and the policy-making system and for members of the Oireachtas to engage directly with publicly funded researchers. I would encourage my colleagues in the Oireachtas to contact the Council and take advantage of this opportunity.</p>  <p>  Science Foundation Ireland places a particular priority on creating opportunities for the Houses of the Oireachtas staff and members to engage with SFI funded researchers over the past number of years. Many of these engagements have been arranged in close partnership with the Oireachtas and Library Research Services. The Oireachtas LRS is now a formal partner with SFI through the SFI Public Service Fellowship (launched in 2019) which will see academic researchers placed within the Oireachtas LRS (and other Government Departments) teams working side by side with colleagues there on critical areas such as climate change and the economic, social and ethical implications of technological innovation.</p>  <p>  There have also been targeted talks by researchers, and science week events. In addition to these examples of engagement, SFI has also brought Oireachtas Committees on site visits to their research centres so that they can see, first hand, the research that is taking place in Ireland which is of relevance to the work of their Committees. </p>  <p>  Both SFI and the IRC are creating engagement opportunities through a range of formats, and these engagements are created to expose members and staff of the Oireachtas to the excellent and impactful work research that is being carried out by academics in Ireland and to create opportunities for dialogue and relationship building with that community. </p>  <p>  Public and Government outreach by our scientists is more important than ever in the context of COVID-19, and my Department, in consultation with all other relevant Government departments and agencies, will consider how best to further engage publicly funded researchers in the wider context as part of the development of the next national strategy for research and innovation. </p></reply>

The Framework aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture which is safe, respectful and supportive. Institutions have a duty of care to their students and staff, and a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours.</p>  <p>  The findings emerging from the Sexual Experiences Survey 2020 (SES  ) published in June 2020 by the NUI Galway Active Consent Programme in partnership with the Union of Students in Ireland are deeply concerning. Therefore, in early August, I wrote to the Presidents of the publically funded higher education institutions indicating that I wanted to prioritise the implementation of this Framework; and requested that they develop institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment, make consent classes mandatory for all incoming students, and report to the Higher Education Authority on their progress on the implementation of the Framework for Consent. In addition, I will be requesting a survey to be undertaken on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying of both staff and students in the higher education institutions. </p>  <p>  The Framework for Consent outlined that research be undertaken on student and staff experiences in this area, and I will keep this issue under review in the light of the work already underway, and the actions I am now taking.   </p></reply>

Due to reopening of FET institutions generally happening in advance of the reopening of higher education, delivery of devices to those settings is being prioritised.  Under the terms of the grant, devices must remain the property of the HEI/ETB, be offered to students under appropriate lending schemes, and also comply with certain conditions of sanction set down by the Office of Government Chief Information Officer in relation to security and appropriate usage.</p></reply>

The SFI Public Service Fellowship, which was launched in 2019, offers researchers a unique opportunity to be seconded to Government Departments, Agencies and the Oireachtas Library and Research Services, to work on specific research projects. The Fellowships awarded will foster innovation within the Public Sector by supporting the development and implementation of data-driven and evidence-based approaches. </p>  <p>  The projects are due to commence in the coming weeks. The projects offered by the hosts include a wide range of topics &ndash; including the economic, social and ethical implications of technological innovation; data analytics for signals of emerging food safety risks;  the economic cost of discrimination and the benefits of diversity in the workplace, to name a few.</p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic it became very clear to me the essential input, expertise and service that the academic research community can provide to bolster colleagues in Government Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  Equally, placements within Government Departments and Agencies will expose academic researchers to the mechanics of public service and policy making which will contribute greatly to their career development.  The secondment model will also provide an opportunity for further dissemination of knowledge and learnings to a broader academic cohort on return of the Fellow to their academic institution.   Thus, the Public Service Fellowship pilot programme will help in increasing the linkages between the research and civil service systems.</p></reply>

They provide psychological counselling to students experiencing personal adjustment, developmental and/or psychological problems that require professional attention. They assist students in identifying and learning skills that will assist them to effectively meet their educational and life goals. They support and enhance the healthy growth and development of students through consultation and outreach to the campus community. I do not have information in the numbers of academic staff trained in suicide awareness, but the Counsellors provide psychological expertise and advice to HEI front-line staff in managing critical incidents and complex cross service student mental health presentations.</p>  <p>The vision of Connecting for Life: Ireland&rsquo;s National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015&ndash;2020   is to reduce lives lost by suicide and to empower communities and individuals to improve their mental health and well-being. Young adults are identified as a group who are at increased risk of mental health issues and suicide and the majority of third-level students fall within this group. While individual HEIs provide guidance, policies and procedures to support student success, not all HEIs have fully documented guidance on areas such as mental health policy.

Those places will be in areas such as ICT, Science, Engineering and Professional Construction.</p>  <p>  The provision of these places gives us scope to ease anxiety, reduce uncertainty and demonstrate the ability of the education system to respond to student concerns. While some options usually open to school leavers, such as travel and alternative experiences, will be more restricted than in the past there are more choices and options across the higher and further education system than ever before.</p></reply>

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p>  <p>  A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

The Agency does, however, operate an office in Sydney as part of it global footprint of 19 offices which includes a number of locations in the Asia-Pacific region. The IDA continues to review its presence overseas on an ongoing basis, in line with the strong emphasis it places on attracting FDI from different markets. </p>  <p>  The IDA has made significant progress in attracting first-time investors from the Asia-Pacific region. In recent years we have seen notable investments from Chinese, Indian and South Korean firms. This shows that the concerted effort that the IDA has made to target Asian investors is now producing results in terms of new jobs here on the ground in Ireland.</p>  <p>  While much has been accomplished in this context, the Government remains conscious of our need to continue attracting FDI from as many different countries as possible. To diversify investment here further, we need to build awareness of Ireland as a preferred investment destination in target countries, as well as improve competitiveness and consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths in terms of talent, productivity and ease of doing business. I am confident that this approach will help boost further the number of investors here from non-traditional markets and that we will continue to see greater geographic diversity across the IDA's client portfolio. The Agency's efforts in this context are already being reinforced and supported by the Global Ireland strategy, which will build and deepen Ireland's footprint all over the world in the period up to 2025.</p></reply>

I know that employers, employees and the self-employed in this sector want to get back to work as quickly as possible and I support them in that ambition.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, in recent weeks there have been multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 across workplaces, households and in sports clubs with the result that it has not yet been  possible for the  Government to relax the restrictions on the number of people who may gather at indoor events. Instead, the Government, in light of public health advice,  agreed to put in place a number of measures until September 13 in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Such action was necessary to protect the vulnerable in our communities, enable schools to reopen and support the resumption of health services.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the July Stimulus package was introduced to help businesses to open, to help those that are already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, there are new opportunities. These new measures are in addition to those already announced since the onset of the Global Pandemic.  Significantly to support viable businesses and jobs, including new hires, we have extended the wage subsidy scheme, which run until the end of March 2021 and will be open to firms that do not currently participate and open to workers like seasonal workers who were not previously included. We are also giving companies extra assistance to reopen and stay open through an enhanced Restart grant available to more firms and more generous. We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. We have also announced a six month reduction in the VAT, going down from 23% to 21%, together with a range of additional measures designed to stimulate domestic demand.  Businesses affected by Covid-19 will able e to delay payment of their PAYE and VAT debts in part of in full for a set period with no interest or penalties</p>  <p>  Further information on these, along with the full list of actions within the July Stimulus and how to avail of them, can be found at www.gov.ie/jobsstimulus.</p>  <p>  Representatives of the trade fair and events industry have submitted proposals to my colleague Minister of State Troy which outline how trade fairs and exhibitions could be conducted safely. These proposals have been shared with the Minister for Health and will be considered by the Government in the context of lifting restrictions into the future, as we seek to balance public health, economic and social aspects of living with COVID-19 in the short to medium term and try to bring some greater certainty so that society and business can plan forward.</p></reply>

The fee that producers pay for plastic packaging placed on the market, in 2020, is &euro;114.32 per tonne. Under the scheme responsibility is shared across the supply chain and different packaging materials are charged at individual rates, reflecting the level of subsidy required to ensure those material are recovered. Further details on the overall fee structure are available in Repak's annual report .</p><p>Fees paid by producers in other EU countries vary greatly from one country to another, depending on the EPR model in place. Different countries have different markets, funding models, collection and treatment infrastructure. Therefore, it is not entirely appropriate to compare fees.</p><p>I recently launched the 'Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy' which details a suite of measures to address the impact of plastics in our environment. This includes the introduction of a deposit and return scheme for plastic bottles and aluminium cans, a ban on certain single use plastics (SUPs) from July 2021, significantly reduce SUPs being placed on the market by 2026, all packaging reusable or recyclable by 2030. Other measures include mandatory EPR for all packaging producers before the 2024 EU deadline and new rules for EPR schemes to incentivise good practice in waste recycling and product design.</p></reply>

Given the complexity of this incident in terms of number of search resources and duration of the incident  the review is not yet to hand.</p><p>Valentia first became aware of the incident shortly after 10pm on 12<sup>th</sup>August and a full scale search and rescue mission was mounted. The Galway RNLI was the first resource to be tasked, followed by the Shannon based Coast Guard Helicopter and Aran Islands lifeboat. Coast Guard units based at Costelloe Bay and Doolin were also tasked that night. The Sligo based helicopter joined the search shortly before 3 AM, the Shannon Helicopter was subsequently re-tasked to be relieved by the Waterford based helicopter. From early morning 17 vessels of opportunity participated in the search and were coordinated by Valentia.</p><p>All  search equipment on the Coast Guard helicopters including Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) and Night Sun search light were fully operational. The search was hampered by poor visibility, squalls and heavy showers. The search planning tool used  by the Coast Guard automatically utilises wind and tide conditions and subsequent checks confirmed that information for the locality was accurately recorded. </p><p>Search planning had to be mindful of many potential changing scenarios in terms of the potential location of the casualties with regard to changing tides, local weather variations, the potential that the casualties  might have been individually separated or separated from the boards. The possibility that they might have paddled ashore or got access to  another stationary device had also to be considered.  In that context a number of reports of potential sightings were also considered, most of which were investigated.</p><p>The casualties were eventually located within the predicted search box, mindful that with the passage of time this box would have considerably expanded. At that time the focus of the search was moving to the South West of Galway Bay and the Aran Islands. Shortly after 11 Am on the 13<sup>th</sup>of August a member of the public on Inisheer alerted Valentia to a possible sighting South West of Inisheer. A number of resources were tasked to the area. This message was picked up by the vessel <i>Johhny O</i>, operated by the members of the Oliver family and they were requested by Valentia to also proceed to the area of interest. As is well documented the Oliver&rsquo;s were first on scene and successfully located and recovered the casualties.</p><p>The casualties displayed an immense level of mental and physical strength to have survived their ordeal and to their credit were wearing personal floatation devices. Of equal importance was the fact that the alert was raised when they had not returned at the anticipated time.</p><p>This is a an incident with a happy ending and as always the response and collaboration of the Search and Rescue resources supported by the maritime and local communities was of the highest standard.</p></reply>

The Exchequer allocates funding for the purposes of both capital and current expenditure from the Department's Vote to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for allocation to the transport operators for the provision of public transport services and infrastructure.  In Budget 2020, an overall allocation of &euro;1 billion was secured to fund public and sustainable transport projects this year.</p><p>Since 2010, the award of Public Service Obligation (PSO) funding falls under the independent statutory remit of the NTA.  The allocations to the companies are decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.</p><p>The sharp decline in passenger numbers since mid-March this year as a result of the Covid-19 health emergency has caused an unprecedented fall in fare revenues, thus creating a wide gap between the operators' costs and actual revenues. This has put acute pressure on the existing Public Service Obligation (PSO) budget.  In response to this situation, and in recognition of the role of public transport as an essential service and in facilitating the Government's <i>Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business, </i>on 4 June the Government decided to make a substantial increase to the 2020 total PSO allocation, in order to enable the continuation of PSO services for the full year.</p><p>In view of the above and the NTA's role in allocating transport funding to individual transport operators, I have referred the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply.Please inform my private office if you do you receive a reply within ten days.</p></reply>

It is a stand-alone measure to preserve the link between employee and employer and support firm viability through an unprecedented enterprise environment and it is based on clear, objective criteria that may be determined by the Revenue Commissioners.  </p>  <p>  The position in relation to the EWSS and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay, sick pay or pension schemes.</p>  <p>  In designing the scheme, concerns around manipulation of access to the EWSS have been addressed to the greatest extent possible. Subsection 2(6) of Section 2B of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Bill 2020 has safeguards in place. This section provides Revenue with significant powers to address the type of abuse the Deputy is referring to, i.e. if an employer &ldquo;has resorted to any contrivance by way of deferring, suspending increasing or decreasing the gross pay that would otherwise have been paid to the qualifying employee.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Anything beyond that would be expressly outside of the remit of the Revenue Commissioners, but there are a sufficient number of bodies that deal with employment disputes in Ireland and where there is a high amount of expertise including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Although these bodies fall under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, it is understood that there are already checks and balances in place to ensure fairness to employees and employers.</p>  <p>  Further, the proposed legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the EWSS must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances.  Following such review, if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer will meet the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, namely, at least a 30 per cent reduction in business turnover or customer orders in the period from 1 July to 31 December 2020 by reference to the corresponding 2019 period, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.</p>  <p>  Finally, the administration of the EWSS will be placed under the care and management of Revenue, as was done with its predecessor, the TWSS. While Revenue&rsquo;s focus on the EWSS in its early stages will no doubt be concentrated on getting the scheme up and running and ensuring that all employers who are eligible for subsidy payments receive the payments in a timely manner, I have no doubt but that Revenue will, in due course, undertake an appropriate employer compliance campaign relating to the EWSS.</p></reply>

It is temporary in nature, with the duration and scope limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. It was adopted at ECOFIN, and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 19 May 2020. </p>  <p>  Briefly, the Commission will borrow on financial markets to finance loans to Member States, allowing Member States benefit from the EU&rsquo;s strong credit rating (AAA) and low borrowing costs. Under the proposal, SURE will provide financial assistance to Member States of up to &euro;100bn in total. The loans are targeted to assist Member States to address sudden increases in public expenditure caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, in order to preserve employment (such as short-time work schemes and other similar measures put in place for the self-employed) and certain occupational health expenditure.  </p>  <p>  SURE would come with safeguards to ensure fair and equitable access to funding for MS, with no more than &euro;60 billion available to any three MS, under the proposal. The loans will be underpinned by a system of voluntary guarantees from Member States. For a lending volume of &euro;100bn under the SURE instrument, &euro;25bn in guarantee commitments are required from all Member States collectively. This guarantee mechanism ensures MS do not have to pay any money upfront.  The instrument would not become available until all Member States sign up to their guarantee amount, and these commitments would remain in place for the full term of the loans which they are underwriting. </p>  <p>  Each Member State contributes to the guarantee in proportion to its relative share in the total Gross National Income of the Union. For Ireland, this would be equivalent to &euro;483m (1.9% of EU-27 GNI).  </p>  <p>  On 24 and 25 August the EU Commission published plans to give &euro;87.3bn in loans to 16 Member States as part of the first tranche of SURE loans. Once the Council approves these applications, financial support will be provided in the form of loans making use of the EU Commission&rsquo;s low cost of borrowing. This funding will be made available over the course of the coming months. The remaining &euro;12.7bn is available for disbursement.  There will be more than one tranche of funding.</p>  <p>  A decision to make a formal application to the SURE loan scheme will be taken by Government in the coming weeks and the necessary information is being prepared at present.  It is likely that the expenditure on the (now ended) Temporary Wage Subsidy scheme will be largely eligible for the SURE instrument.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation.  </p>  <p>  The legislation governing the HTB scheme is set out in section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  In addition to requiring that the new property is occupied as the sole or main residence of a first time purchaser, the legislation also defines a &lsquo;qualifying residence&rsquo; for the purposes of the scheme.  The legislation is very specific as to the definition of a qualifying residence.  It must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling. Thus, for a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a home not having been previously been used as a home. Renovation or refurbishment of old houses to either upgrade or reinstate them for habitation does not qualify for the HTB incentive. </p>  <p>  As regards the specific case outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, given that the house has previously been lived in, Revenue advise me that it would not be considered a qualifying residence for the purposes of HTB, and HTB relief would not be available.</p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. The Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for affordable new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.

The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of <b>qualifying employees</b>on the payroll.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;203 and &euro;1,462 gross per week, the level of subsidy is &euro;203.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99 gross per week, the subsidy is &euro;151.50.  No subsidy is paid for employees paid less than &euro;151.50 or more than &euro;1,462 gross per week.  </p><p>Unlike the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, there is no restriction on the date by which a new hire must have been hired by a company to avail of the EWSS, provided such recruitments are undertaken for bona fide business purposes and not with the intention to maximise subsidy claims.  A subsidy can be claimed in respect of employees of an impacted business on the payroll and in receipt of gross wages between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462 subject to limited exceptions in relation to connected persons during the period of the scheme.  </p><p>Connected persons includes the husband, wife, civil partner or relative of the employer, and relative includes a lineal descendant, brother, sister, uncle aunt, nice or nephew.  I have been advised by Revenue that only connected persons on the payroll of the employer and paid at any time between 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020 are eligible for EWSS.  Thus newly hired connected persons are not considered eligible employees.  </p><p>In recognition of the exclusion from TWSS of new entities, seasonal employees and new hires, under EWSS eligible employers can back date a claim for the EWSS to 1 July 2020 where the employer was not eligible for TWSS or, where the employer had employees not eligible for TWSS. These cases will be dealt with as part of a &lsquo;sweepback&rsquo; with payment to employers made in September.  </p><p>Finally, I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the comprehensive information on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, including guidance for employers who wish to make a claim under the &lsquo;sweepback&rsquo; process which is available on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

The objective of the EWSS is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible, as well as enabling employers scale back up their business.</p>  <p>  The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  A sole-trader&rsquo;s business may be a qualifying employer for the purpose of the scheme, the same as is the case for any other employer.  As was the case under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), sole-traders are not eligible to claim the EWSS in respect of their own employment as they are not employees &ndash; and further, may not necessarily be paid via the payroll system unlike proprietary directors who are obliged to have PAYE operated on any payments made to them personally.</p>  <p>  The EWSS is a significant economy wide support for employers, but it is not the only measure that the Government have put in place to support businesses at this time, including those that are specifically targeted at sole-traders, such as the income tax loss relief measure that was announced in July as part of the Stimulus Package. This new once-off income tax relief is targeted at self-employed individuals carrying on a trade or profession who were profitable in 2019 but, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, incur losses in 2020. The measure allows such individuals to claim to have those losses (and certain unused capital allowances) carried back and deducted from their profits for the tax year 2019 providing a cash-flow boost of up to &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 as applicable.</p>  <p>  Further, there are a range of other business support measures available, such as Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

The average monthly cost is around &euro;500m which would be the expected cost per month if the measure was to be retained beyond the end date of 31 August.</p><p>Revenue published detailed statistical updates on the TWSS on a weekly basis for the duration of the scheme in order to provide as timely and transparent data on the utilisation and impact of the TWSS as possible. These statistics are available at: . </p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was legislated for in the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, replacing the TWSS from 1 September 2020 until March 2021. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.This adaptation from the TWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. </p><p>Revenue has confirmed that it has started to include information on the EWSS in their statistics, also located at the above link.  As of 7 September, over 30,000 employers have registered for the Scheme. The EWSS detail in the statistics, including the numbers of employees being supported, will be expanded in the coming weeks as the scheme progresses.</p><p>It is expected that the EWSS will support around 350,000 jobs into the beginning of 2021.  On this basis, it is estimated that the EWSS will cost &euro;2.25 billion (&euro;1.35 billion in 2020 inclusive of seasonal workers and &euro;0.9 billion in 2021).  All things remaining the same, a tentative estimate of the additional cost if the EWSS was to be extended for the full year 2021 would be in the region of &euro;3 billion.  The scheme is demand led and a significant surge in claims may require a policy review and re-evaluation of the terms of the scheme.  These cost predictions are therefore subject to review and for every additional 50,000 qualifying employments, the cost increases by &euro;0.25 billion.</p><p>Although many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020 because of the continued need to observe some requirements such as social distancing.  The Government is therefore committed to a wage subsidy scheme to maintain the link between the employee and employer insofar as is possible into 2021.</p></reply>

Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.

This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers.</p><p>Accordingly, there are no records available on the number of people availing of the scheme. </p><p>Tax expenditure reports prepared by my Department have estimated the cost in the full years referenced at &euro;4 million but have been clear that this figure was an estimate as separate returns are not required. </p><p>The Programme for Government- Our Shared Future recognises that &ldquo;<i>Necessary improvements in climate impact, quality of life, air quality and physical and mental health demand that every effort is made by the Government to make active travel and public transport better and more accessible</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>The Programme provides a commitment to widen the eligibility of the Bike to Work scheme and specifically to &ldquo;<i>provide an increased proportionate allowance for e-bikes and cargo bikes</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Section 9 of the Financial Provision (Covid-19)(No.2) Act 2020 provided for amendments to the Cycle to Work Scheme to increase the allowable expenditure from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 in respect of  e-bikes and &euro;1,250 in respect of bicycles and to amend the conditions to allow the purchase of a new bicycle every 4 years instead of 5.</p><p>Prior to this, the threshold had not been changed since the cycle to work scheme was introduced in 2009. It should also be noted that safety equipment such as cycle helmets, panniers and luggage carriers and locks can add significantly to the base cost of the bicycle.  As pedelecs (e-bikes) are more expensive than other bicycles a higher threshold was provided for them.</p></reply>

Table 3 on page 10 of the analysis for 2017 shows, in relation to each specified relief, the number of individuals subject to the Restriction who declared that they used the relief. It also includes the amount of the relief declared as used by those individuals. I expect that report for 2018 will be published shortly.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to assess the implications of the extension of the restriction to other reliefs, as such reliefs are not reported on HIIR returns filed by the relevant individuals. In any event, the purpose of the HIIR is to limit reliefs so that the relevant cohort of high earning taxpayers is paying a minimum effective rate. The HIIR analysis published by Revenue indicates that this outcome is already being achieved. The limiting of further reliefs in the manner suggested would therefore have no effect on the yield of the HIIR since the restriction only applies up to the point where an individual meets the minimum effective rate and not beyond that point.</p></reply>

It is not an income support for the individual so it is ultimately up to the employer to claim the subsidy, if they qualify.</p>  <p>  The EWSS was legislated for in the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  The eligibility criteria for EWSS state that an employer must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 July and 31 December 2020, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  A qualifying employer is allow to claim a flat-rate subsidy for any qualifying employees on the payroll.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;203 and &euro;1,462 gross per week, the level of subsidy is &euro;203.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99 gross per week, the subsidy is &euro;151.50.  No subsidy is paid for employees paid less than &euro;151.50 or more than &euro;1,462 gross per week.  An employer is not obliged to claim the subsidy for all their qualifying employees.</p>  <p>  From the details provided, it is assumed that the individual is an employee who also has caring responsibilities in their own home.</p>  <p>  As explained above, it is up to the employer to determine if they qualify for the EWSS and to make a claim, but I would like to assure the Deputy that there is no distinction made between full time and part time workers in the EWSS, and no minimum requirement of hours worked - provided the appropriate level of gross pay is paid by the eligible employer to the qualifying employee on the payroll, a subsidy may be claimed.</p></reply>

The most recent guidance issued by my Department on the matter is Circular 19/2019, which is available online at: .</p><p>Finally, I note that the question asks about pension increases in the &lsquo;public sector&rsquo;, which is generally understood as including the commercial semi State bodies. Under the various pension scheme rules operational to such bodies, in the first instance, it is matter for the Government Department under whose aegis responsibility for individual commercial semi State Bodies falls to consider and approve any pension increase sought, with the consent of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform. Obviously, as part of such decisions, account must also be taken of the overall funding position in the relevant pension funds prior to taking any decisions on pension increases. The impact of pension increases on the sustainability of pension funds is an important overall consideration.</p></reply>

The CFRAM Programme culminated with the launch on 3<sup>rd</sup>May, 2018 of 29 flood risk management plans which identified 118 new outline flood relief works on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the OPW.  These projects are being funded under the Government's 10-year flood risk investment programme of almost &euro;1 billion under the <i>National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027</i>.  The key conclusion of the Flood Risk Management Plans is that 95% of properties assessed through CFRAM can be protected through continued investment in flood relief schemes. </p><p>The implementation of the Government's whole of Government approach to flood risk has delivered many sector led initiatives, including the 2009 statutory planning guidelines and the emergency response structures in preparing for and responding to a flood event. The Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group, which I chair, is developing a range of non-structural policy options to help mitigate flood risk for those properties where a flood relief scheme is not viable. In that regard a priority is the establishment of the national Flood Forecasting Service that is being developed by Met &Eacute;ireann and overseen by the OPW.  The service will deal with flood forecasting from both fluvial (river) and coastal sources. When fully operational, it will involve the issuing of flood forecasts and general alerts. </p><p>The Group also co-ordinated the Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for Flood Risk Management in line with its requirements under the National Adaptation Framework. The Plan, approved by the Government in October, 2019, sets out the cross sectoral impacts of climate change on flood risk. The long-term goal adopted on climate adaptation for flooding and flood risk management and set out in the Plan is to promote sustainable communities and support our environment through the effective management of the potential impacts of climate change on flooding and flood risk.  To deliver on this goal, the Government has approved 21 actions across flood risk prevention, protection and preparedness, as well as further research and capacity building.</p><p>It also remains open to Local Authorities to apply to the OPW for funding of flood mitigation projects of up to &euro;750,000 under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects.  Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the Scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management.</p><p>Rising sea levels, increasing storm activity and coastal erosion, arising from climate change is expected to have a considerable impact on coastal areas.  The Government has recently established an Inter-Departmental Group on Managing Coastal Change to scope out an approach for the development of a national co-ordinated and integrated strategy to manage the projected impact of coastal change to our coastal communities, economies, heritage, culture and environment.  The Inter-Departmental Group is jointly chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the OPW and will bring forward options and recommendations for the Government to consider.</p></reply>

This is &euro;10,060 million (23.9%) ahead of the same period in 2019 and &euro;7,827million (17.7%) ahead of the profile for 2020. Of  this, gross voted current expenditure of &euro;47,946 million is &euro;9,293 million (24.0%) ahead on the same period last year and &euro;7,561 million (18.7%) ahead of profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;4,129 million is &euro;767 million (22.8%) ahead on the same period in 2019 and &euro;266 million (6.9%) ahead of profile. </p>  <p>  The profiles against which this spend is reported were published in February of this year, based on the overall gross voted amount of &euro;70.4 billion set out in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2020 published in December 2019,  and as such, they do not reflect additional spending in relation to Covid-19. Consequently, the Departmental overspends versus profile highlight the areas where additional Covid-19 related expenditure has been allocated.</p>  <p>  The most significant areas of overspend relate to payments of approximately &euro;6 billion in respect of Covid-19 by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, roughly broken down as &euro;3.3 billion in relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and &euro;2.7 billion in relation to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p>  <p>  Overall expenditure in the Department of Health is &euro;1.2 billion above profile for end-August. This is due to the drawdown of funds for the HSE in relation to Covid-19 including for PPE, Ventilators, the Private Hospital Agreement, and Testing and Tracing. Capital expenditure in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is &euro;556m ahead of profile. The main driver for this is the additional funding granted on the Enterprise Ireland programme and other Business Support Grants, allocated in light of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  From the beginning of the crisis to end-June, a wide range of supports were introduced. These include in particular the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, significant additional resources for our Health sector and a range of supports for businesses. In July, the Government launched the July Stimulus, a &euro;7.4 billion package of tax and expenditure measures, designed to support the economy as businesses and society reopen. The purpose of these measures is to provide additional targeted supports to stimulate activity across the economy, assist firms and support employment. As outlined at that time, these measures brought the overall increase in expenditure for 2020 to an estimated &euro;16.2 billion, relative to the overall spending estimate of &euro;70.4 billion set out in the REV 2020, also taking into account further spending that may be required to support key sectors as the year progresses.  </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to restate the 2020 Revised Estimates to take account of the additional spending arising from Covid-19 and also the impact of the Departmental transfers of functions. As part of the Budget process, the 2020 Estimates will be updated to reflect these additional resources as well as to reflect the impact of Transfers of Functions on Departmental expenditure ceilings, with the estimated outturn for the year also being published in the White Paper - Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure in advance of the Budget.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner / co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. The position on the minimum income requirement is a matter for consideration. </p>  <p>  The review of the Scheme is part of a significant body of work undertaken in the Department in relation to the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

The revised Regulations included the addition of investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies, as a permitted investment class for credit unions. Accordingly, since 1 March 2018, credit unions are permitted to provide funding, through a regulated investment vehicle, to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing.  </p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department referred the Credit Union representative bodies to the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) with a view to both sectors sharing, as far as practical, the benefits of their respective work in this area, including the work undertaken by the ICSH on the development of special purpose vehicles for social housing financing purposes. The work of the ICSH was supported by grant funding from my Department. </p>  <p>  The ICSH, along with six Tier 3 AHBs, have worked with specialist financial advisors to establish a funding mechanism or vehicle which would identify suitable sources of non-state finance to fund the delivery of social housing by AHBs, based on best value for money. Market testing undertaken revealed good interest in lending to the AHB sector from various lenders including banks, institutional investors and the Credit Union sector. So far, one AHB has set up an SPV and several AHBs have sourced finance from private institutions. As such, the work in this area is ongoing and has led to individual AHBs establishing SPVs for financing social housing.</p>  <p>  Separately, I was pleased to welcome a recent announcement by Initiative Ireland and CUDA, the Credit Union Development Agency, of their plan to launch a new social and affordable housing fund supported by the Credit Unions of Ireland.  The new fund will enable Credit Unions to avail of the regulatory changes which enable them to lend to AHBs through a regulated fund.  Indeed I met with Initiative Ireland and CUDA about this particular initiative on the occasion of the announcement.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union sector is one potential funder whose terms are assessed as part of the process of market testing to establish best value for money and optimum terms and conditions from lenders.  While my Department will continue to be available to provide any clarifications that may be required in relation to the delivery of social and affordable housing, it falls to the relevant parties, i.e. the AHBs, on the one hand, and potential investors on the other, as in the cases outlined above, to agree a workable and mutually acceptable approach in order to bring potential investment possibilities to a successful conclusion.</p></reply>

This was an important first step in the Government's assessment as to the impact of the Eurostat decision. The Department of Finance undertook an analysis of the implications for General Government Expenditure and General Government Debt and concluded that there are no direct Exchequer implications and the projections do not present any particular issue in the context of the fiscal rules.</p><p>In addition, my Department engaged with AHB sector representative bodies (namely, the Irish Council for Social Housing and the Housing Alliance) to examine proposals, including proposals which were presented by those bodies, as a possible means to achieve reclassification. The proposals are complex as they cut across a wide range of social housing policy issues and require extensive analysis. </p><p>An important part of this exercise is to examine the feasibility of measures which can be taken to develop the AHB sector in such as way so that it could be reclassified as being 'off-balance sheet', without undermining the foundations of social housing policy. In this context, it must be accepted that this will more likely be a more longer term objective.  </p><p>Constructive discussions took place with AHB representative bodies on a number of occasions and these informed a pathway for dealing with the issues involved. It was agreed that a working group would be established to consider these issues further. </p><p>The first meeting of the AHB Classification Working Group took place on 24 June 2020. The group comprises representatives from:</p><p>- My Department;</p><p>- Department of Finance;</p><p>- The Housing Agency;</p><p>- The Housing Finance Agency;</p><p>- Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH); and</p><p>- The Housing Alliance</p><p>The group is tasked with examining and making recommendations in relation to the following:</p><p>- Clarify the impact of the CSO&rsquo;s classification decision on General Government Debt and General Government Expenditure;</p><p>- Assess the impact of the classification decision on the AHB sector (administrative, reporting, Tiers of AHBs, etc.) and assess the impact on delivery of housing under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan; and</p><p>- Examine the detailed sectoral proposals to achieve reclassification in the context of social housing policy more generally.</p><p>The group is committed to working constructively to address this complex issue, in line with the commitment set out in the<i>Programme for Government Our Shared Future. </i></p><p>Notwithstanding the decision by Eurostat, the Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to the delivery of social housing. It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that momentum is maintained towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target. This statistical classification will not affect these ambitious plans.</p></reply>

Subsequent to this, and commencing in February 2019, there has been an ongoing series of engagements to work towards the development of a stable structural and operational framework for the future to replace the existing system of Service Level Agreements between Irish Water and each of the 31 local authorities, although progress to date has been slow.</p>  <p>  Consistent with the Programme for Government and building on the work that has been undertaken to date through the WRC, I am planning to bring forward a clear set of policy recommendations setting out my own and the Government&rsquo;s expectations.  To this end, I look forward to communicating directly with the parties involved.</p>  <p>  I recognise the challenges arising, and the concerns which all parties have, notably the workers.  The proposed changes also give rise to significant challenges for the local government sector in Ireland. Any process of transformation needs to be cognisant of the potential impacts on the wider local government system.</p>  <p>  On this basis I have met recently with representatives of ICTU and the relevant affiliated unions (F&oacute;rsa, UNITE, SIPTU and Connect) to outline my proposed course of action, and to hear their views, which have been further communicated to me in writing since the meeting.</p></reply>

Our sympathies go to the families who have lost loved ones in this way and indeed to the dedicated service providers that have also suffered the loss. </p>  <p>  Supporting households experiencing homelessness is a priority for this Government. The Programme for Government recognises that many households experiencing homelessness have additional support needs and includes specific measures to address these needs.  These include measures to help rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of Housing First, with a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bed homes, and, importantly, ensuring that necessary health and mental health supports are provided to assist homeless people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  Ultimately the key to resolving homelessness is to increase the supply of housing, particularly for those on the lowest incomes. To this end, the Programme for Government commits to the increased supply of public, social and affordable homes.  In particular, we will increase the social housing stock by more than 50,000 with an emphasis on new builds.</p></reply>

Ireland contributes humanitarian assistance to alleviate the worst of the suffering in the Gaza Strip, including through our support for UNRWA, totalling &euro;7 million this year, which is a key provider of public services, health and education in Gaza.  Recently, my Department allocated additional funding to support the medical response to the pandemic in Gaza, including &euro;125,000 allocated to Oxfam, and &euro;1.2 million in support of social protection measures.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the agreement announced on 31 August to de-escalate the situation in and around Gaza. This should now be fully respected by all parties, including the reopening of the Kerem Shalom border crossing, allowing fuel deliveries to Gaza&rsquo;s electricity plant, and the restoration of Gaza&rsquo;s fishing zone.</p>  <p>  The roots of the problem in Gaza are political and cannot be solved by funding alone. I have consistently called for the lifting of the blockade, so that normal life and normal economic activity can resume, and I will continue to make every effort to ensure that the situation in Gaza remains high on the international agenda, particularly as we prepare to take up our seat on the UN Security Council in January 2021.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-09a.334.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020090900072#WRG05600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 146 together.</p>  <p>  I have given a high priority to the Middle East Peace Process since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2017, and I continue to do so as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence in the current Government. I have made four working visits to Israel and Palestine, most recently in December 2019. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that the Government will &ldquo;continue to work with other Member States to give leadership within the EU to oppose any annexation or plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over territory in the West Bank, which is part of the occupied Palestinian territory. The Government would regard any such moves as a breach of international law and would consider an appropriate response to them at both national and international level.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Israel&rsquo;s announcement that it will suspend plans to annex parts of the occupied Palestinian territory is welcome. High Representative / Vice President Josep Borrell also welcomed the announcement on behalf of the EU in a Declaration on 15 August. I have noted with concern, however, subsequent Israeli statements that annexation plans remain on the table and call for any such plans to be permanently withdrawn.</p>  <p>  The unilateral annexation by Israel of any part of the occupied Palestinian territory would be a clear violation of international law. It would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland, or by the international community more generally, and would be deeply damaging to the two-state solution.</p>  <p>  I have been forthright in my public statements on the issue of annexation. I have also raised this matter directly and clearly with Israeli leaders in person, including during my visit to the region last December and in telephone and VC conversations with Israeli FM Gabi Ashkenazi in recent months. I have also outlined my concerns about possible annexation in discussions with US representatives.</p>  <p>  I have engaged extensively with European partners, with a view to encouraging strong EU messages, public and private, against such an action. When this was discussed at the 15 May video conference meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, there was broad agreement that the EU and its Member States should convey our concerns directly to the new Israeli Government. That outreach continued throughout the summer. Most recently, EU Foreign Ministers participated in a discussion with the Israeli Foreign Minister during an informal session of the Foreign Affairs Council on 27 August. The EU&rsquo;s firm commitment to a Two State solution to the conflict was conveyed to the Israeli Foreign Minister, in addition to the EU&rsquo;s welcoming of Israel&rsquo;s suspension of annexation plans.  </p>  <p>  Ireland remains ready to support any peace initiative that respects the international parameters for a Two State solution and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, and provides a basis to meet the aspirations of both peoples. I will continue to work to keep this issue high on the international agenda and to prioritise the Middle East Peace Process, amongst other issues, as we prepare to take up our seat on the UN Security Council in January 2021.</p></reply>

This is an issue where there could be benefits to moving in step with EU partners, and it is a matter that I discuss regularly with EU colleagues.</p>  <p>  However, recognition by Ireland outside the context of an overall peace agreement would also undoubtedly affect Ireland&rsquo;s influence on the Israel-Palestine conflict at EU and international level. Timing and context would affect whether this loss of influence would be matched by delivering a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people and a positive impact on the peace process. I am continuing to monitor the situation closely.</p></reply>

Ireland recognises that the pandemic and its associated economic and social impacts magnifies the vulnerabilities of the refugee population, whilst also threatening the broader stability of the region.</p>  <p>  To date in 2020, Ireland has disbursed &euro;6 million in funding to UNRWA, comprising &euro;5 million in core funding to UNRWA&rsquo;s Programme Budget, of which &euro;1 million was earmarked for use in Lebanon, and a further &euro;1 million in support of UNRWA&rsquo;s Syria Regional Crisis Emergency Appeal. In addition to these amounts, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney TD, pledged a further &euro;1 million to the UNRWA Programme Budget at an extraordinary virtual Pledging Conference in June which will be disbursed shortly. Overall, this will bring Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to UNRWA in 2020 to &euro;7 million and &euro;33.5 million in the five years since 2016.</p>  <p>  As well as financial support, Ireland plays an active role within the Advisory Commission of UNRWA. Ireland's Representative Office in Ramallah engages with the agency on an ongoing basis, while the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney TD, has met UNRWA representatives and observed its work at first hand when visiting the region. </p>  <p>  Ireland recognises that the humanitarian crises that existed before COVID-19 have not gone away and  that Palestine Refugees will continue to require the support of the international community. Consequently we will continue to offer policy and financial support for UNRWA's important work in the period ahead.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the fire station is to provide a rapid response in the event of a fire at the Ammunition Depot, and also to respond to fire alarms and fire emergencies within the DFTC. </p>  <p>  Certain purchasing is carried out by the Defence Forces directly under delegation of financial responsibility which permits the Defence Forces to procure a wide range of goods and services directly, this includes the purchasing of fire appliances. I am advised by the military authorities that the DFTC fire station is adequately equipped with a Class B Fire Appliance which was delivered in 2018 following an open tender competition, as well as a reserve Fire Tender which was registered in 1999. There is currently no requirement for the acquisition of additional fire appliances for the DFTC.  </p>  <p>  The other military installation with a requirement for a fire service on island is Casement Aerodrome Baldonnel, where a fire and crash rescue service is required for airfield operations. This service has two Airport Firefighting Tenders which have been in service since 2007 and 2009 respectively. Planning is underway for the replacement of these two appliances in the next 18 months. In addition there is one small 4x4 Fire Tender, the registration year on this vehicle is 2001. </p>  <p>  A contract was placed in 2019 with High Precision Motor Products (HPMP) Ltd. Under an Office of Government Procurement (OGP) Framework Agreement for the supply of a Rapid Intervention Fire Tender (RIFT) at &euro;424,810.20 (incl. VAT). In 2019 &euro;332,100 (incl. VAT) was paid for the Compressed Air Foam System (CAFS) and gantry ladders associated with the fire tender. The remaining sum of &euro;92,710.20 (incl. VAT) will be paid on delivery of the RIFT in Oct 2020. The delivery into service of the RIFT vehicle will augment the existing capability of the Air Corps Fire and Rescue Service at Casement Aerodrome Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  A further contract was placed with HPMP in 2019, again under an OGP Framework Agreement, for the supply of a Class B Fire Tender at a cost of &euro;424,729 (incl. VAT) to replace the Fire Tender that is in service in UNIFIL with the Irish contingent in UNP 2-45 which has been in service since 2001. In 2019 &euro;149,998.50 (incl. VAT) was paid for the Compressed Air Foam System (CAFS), gantry ladders and winch system associated with the fire tender. The remaining sum of &euro;274,730.50 (incl. VAT) will be paid on delivery of the Fire Tender at the end of September 2020.</p>  <p>  The expected service life of these types of appliances is 15-20 years. I am satisfied that, with these new acquisitions and the planning for future procurements, the Defence Forces continue to have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

All of this information is reviewed by a specialist occupational health physician, including  the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when an individual suffers from more than one health condition.   </p>  <p>   The employee is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are general population risk, higher risk, and very high risk. This is in line with the approach being adopted in other areas of the public sector including the health sector. </p>  <p>  The outcome of the risk categorisation is in large measure governed by the HSE guidance.  However, the occupational healthcare service retains the discretion to place someone into the higher risk group if they feel they have more than one complaint and that their combination of risks warrants a higher categorisation. No individual is placed at a lower level of risk than that set out by the HSE standards. </p>  <p>   In general, where the education staff member is in the very high risk category, then the staff member will be provided with alternative working arrangements e.g. working from home.  Where the education staff member is in the general population risk or higher risk category, current HSE guidelines are that this employee could attend the workplace with appropriate social distancing and hygiene measures. Where social distancing is problematic, for example due to the nature of the role, working closely with others is possible providing that adequate controls (e.g. screens, face coverings, PPE) are effective in managing the risk. In this context, the school will discuss with the employee the School Covid-19 Response Plan, as this contains the risk assessment of the school and the measures that are being put in place to mitigate the risk posed by Covid-19.</p>  <p>   Where an individual feels that they have been placed  in an incorrect risk category a review process has been put in place by the occupational healthcare provider. This review will be undertaken by a team of four specialist occupational physicians who re-evaluate the medical evidence and deliver a consensus opinion on the risk categorisation.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the employer, there is an obligation on the school to go through the Covid response plan with the employee and ensure that all appropriate risk mitigation measures are in place for the protection of staff in the school.</p></reply>

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p><p>The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The schools referred to by the Deputy were unsuccessful in their appeals to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p><p>The Roadmap for Full Return to School set outs the plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of our schools.

The supports are comprehensive across a range of areas and involve funding for measures such as PPE, hand sanitisation, enhanced cleaning and hygiene, physical distancing, management supports and substitution provision. It is also recognised that schools may require some reconfiguration works and this is supported by a once off enhanced minor works grant of &euro;75 million to prepare their buildings and classrooms for reopening including an uplift for schools with SEN pupils.</p><p>The public health guidance recognises that the ability to achieve 1m physical distancing for junior infants to 2<sup>nd</sup>classes is not a prerequisite for facilitating a full return of all pupils.  While there is the requirement for 1m physical distancing for the senior classes (3<sup>rd</sup>class to 6<sup>th</sup>class), schools also have the flexibility to organise their classes into bubbles and pods. The requirement in the public health guidance is for each pod to be 1m apart as distinct from each pupil in the pods.</p><p>My Department has published practical guidance for schools to help achieve physical distancing in line with public health advice and include:</p><p>- Reconfiguring classroom accommodation through the removal of unnecessary items of furniture, shelving etc.</p><p>- Using the largest classrooms for the senior classes</p><p>- Reviewing the size of each class so that there is a more even spread of pupils between each class</p><p>- Maximising available space within the footprint of the school</p><p>- If necessary, look at opportunities for sourcing any nearby accommodation for a large class e.g. parish hall, sports facilities etc.  The Department supports same through the minor works grant and additional funding can be provided where necessary.</p><p>The public health advice recognises that the implementation of physical distancing will look different across the various ages and stages of learning and that a balanced and common sense approach should be applied in the implementation of measures, allowing for some flexibility when needed whilst noting that it must be applied in a practical way, recognising that the learning environment cannot be dominated by a potentially counterproductive focus on this issue.</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,953 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.</p></reply>

This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. </p>  <p>  The immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p></reply>

However, my Department has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as flooding under the humanitarian assistance scheme.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the humanitarian assistance scheme is to provide income-tested financial support to people whose homes are damaged and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair. </p>  <p>  The scheme is available to provide support to householders following the recent flooding event in Clifden.   The Community Welfare Service officer is currently engaging with 8 families who have been forced to leave their homes by the recent flooding.  Payments have been made to meet immediate needs, such as clothing and cost of home heating oil to dry out the properties. </p>  <p>  Emergency income support payments to cover essential items such as food, clothing and personal items are issued quickly in the immediate aftermath of the weather event.  Supports towards the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items may take longer as it is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes becomes known.  The longer term supports can cover remedial works such as plastering, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting and it can take several months before this stage of the response is completed.</p>  <p>  If any person who has been affected has not already come forward, they should contact the Community Welfare Service at the Intreo Centre in Clifden. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main focus of the BTEA is to assist qualifying applicants to improve their educational qualifications and improve their prospects of gaining employment. </p>  <p>  Ordinarily a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for at least nine months before being eligible to apply for the BTEA when pursuing a 3rd level qualification.  As announced as part of the July Stimulus, this nine month condition is being waived for recipients of the pandemic unemployment payment wishing to return to education.  Someone in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment is required to transfer their claim to a jobseekers payment to access the BTEA. </p>  <p>  The conditions under which the BTEA operate are designed to ensure that they address the objective of supporting longer term social welfare customers into employment.  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Further and Higher Education represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  </p>  <p>  Applications for the 2020/21 academic year are currently being processed by my Department.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 977,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2020 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  Providing an estimate of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to all children aged under 18 and to those in higher level education is very difficult as the cost is determined by the usage of the extra passes provided and not by the increased number.  The fact that many operators have reduced fares for children and higher education students and that in some cases children under five years of age can travel for free would also have to be taken into account. </p>  <p>  The objective of the free travel scheme is to ensure older people and people with disabilities remain active within their community.  Extending the eligibility of the free travel scheme to the cohort of people the Deputy has suggested would change this objective, and radically change the nature of the scheme.  Any such scheme would also require a fundamental expansion to the administrative set up and operation of the free travel scheme, as it would have to grant and withdraw potentially hundreds of thousands of passes each year, using information which would have to be provided by all the colleges in the State in the case of higher education students.  Any proposals in this regard would have to be considered in the context of priorities for the free travel scheme and the budgetary implications of same. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I want to assure the Deputy that the purpose of the emergency measure, which relates to redundancy entitlements following temporary periods of lay-off and short-time work due to Covid-19, is to ensure that employees have a continued link to their job, have a pathway to return to their employment and also to mitigate the serious risks to businesses and jobs.</p><p>The existing provisions of Section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 (as amended) were not considered adequate to deal with the current Covid-19 emergency situation. As a result of Covid-19, there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-offs and short-time work.  Under the existing timelines set out in Section 12 of the Act this could have resulted in a large number of redundancies over a very short period of time.  Employers are obliged to pay redundancy entitlements to employees who have been temporarily laid off after the periods of time currently provided for in Section 12.  This would have serious unintended and detrimental financial impacts on businesses and employees and would have an adverse impact on the potential for a business to recover which could result in insolvency situations.This would only exacerbate the risk of further permanent job losses.</p><p>For these reasons emergency legislation was enacted which temporarily suspended the provisions of section 12 for the emergency period.  The suspension was considered vital to ensure the future viability of businesses which in turn will help prevent further permanent job losses.  In light of the on-going emergency situation the end date of the emergency measure was extended to 17th September so that businesses can continue to recover and plan their future staffing requirements.</p><p>It is important to note that an employee&rsquo;s right to claim redundancy after a temporary period of lay-off or short-time has not been removed; rather, it has been deferred for a temporary period in this unprecedented emergency situation.</p><p>All other provisions of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 remain unchanged. In situations where an employer has not placed an employee on temporary lay-off but has in fact permanently let them go, the employer is obliged to comply with existing provisions of the Act such as notice of redundancy and the payment of a statutory lump sum payment to eligible employees. </p><p>In the event of a dispute, the employee can seek a determination from the Workplace Relations Commission. The Workplace Relations Commission is the organisation mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation and it remains fully operational.  If employees have concerns or complaints regarding their employment rights they should contact the WRC directly on their telephone helpline at 1890 808090.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State Pension (Transition).  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  The legislation provided for increases to the State pension age - to 67 in 2021 and further to 68 in 2028.  </p>  <p>  This Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State&rsquo;s finances.  However, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case.</p>  <p>  The public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.  Therefore, a Commission on Pensions will be established to examine a range of issues including contributions, calculation methods, sustainability, eligibility and intergenerational fairness.  The Terms of Reference for the Commission on Pensions are currently being developed and options for its membership are being considered.  Proposals will be brought to Government in that regard as soon as possible.  Once it has concluded its deliberations, the Commission will report to Government by June of next year.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Programme for Government also sets out how the planned increase in the State pension age next year will be deferred and it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Commission on Pensions.  I will introduce legislation later this year to do that.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The 2020 revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;4.15 billion.</p>  <p>  Both jobseekers schemes are based on a day of employment or unemployment as the case may be.  A person can work up to 3 days per week but they must be unemployed for 4 in 7 consecutive days. Jobseeker's Benefit is a social insurance scheme paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid. Jobseeker's allowance is a means tested social assistance scheme.  </p>  <p>  Short-time work arrangements in Ireland operate under the Systematic Short-Time (SST) programme, as part of the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit /Jobseekers Allowance schemes.  The programme is designed for use in situations where an employee&rsquo;s working hours are reduced by their employer on a temporary basis. This presents an opportunity for employers to retain skilled labour, in a reduced capacity, thus avoiding the need to recruit once the economic situation improves. </p>  <p>  In a period where we expect demand to recover in many sectors but still remain lower than it was immediately before the pandemic there is scope for a  short-time work support scheme to help employers re-hire staff that were temporarily laid-off rather than to make them redundant.</p>  <p>  In the July Stimulus package, I secured an additional &euro;100 million in funding for a significant ramping up in the delivery of employment services to workers. As part of this initiative, my Department will work with the Department of Finance to develop and implement a new short-time working scheme, using the wage subsidy model, and taking into account international practice (including the scheme referenced by the Deputy), to support job retention and help workers and employers in situations where demand for a firm&rsquo;s services or products is reduced for an extended period of time. In the meantime, the existing Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme and Short-time Work Support schemes will continue to operate. Any proposed changes or expansions to the existing scheme(s) would need to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position at this time.</p></reply>

In situations where an employer has not placed an employee on temporary lay-off but has in fact permanently let them go, the employer is obliged to comply with existing provisions of the Act such as notice of redundancy and the payment of a statutory lump sum payment to eligible employees.</p>  <p>  The matter of a further extension beyond 17th September is currently under consideration.

The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with COVID-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of COVID-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of COVID-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with COVID-19.  It is due to end on 31 March 2021.  People who are awaiting results from a COVID-19 test who meet the medical and eligibility criteria for the enhanced Illness Benefit are entitled to it until they receive a negative test result or, in the case of those diagnosed with the illness, for up to 10 weeks, depending on ongoing medical certification of incapacity for work.</p>  <p>  People who are considered high risk under the HSE guidelines in relation to COVID-19 are not entitled to the enhanced Illness Benefit payment for any period unless they have been diagnosed with or informed that they are a probable source of infection of COVID-19.  Standard Illness Benefit payment may be payable subject to normal certification and eligibility criteria, where a medical practitioner provides a certificate of incapacity stating that a person is incapable of work due to the medical condition.  Standard illness benefit is paid at a maximum weekly personal rate of &euro;203.  Increases may also be paid for qualifying adults and children.  This may be paid for an extended period, depending on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Standard illness benefit is the primary statutory income support payment for insured contributors who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type, apart from the short-term payment in respect of COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  Employees who self-isolate without a medical certificate may approach their employer in relation to taking annual or other paid leave - this is at the discretion of the employer.  Many employers can, and do, agree leave arrangements with staff who need to take short periods of time off.  These include arrangements to enable employees to work remotely from home, to work-up time taken, or to bring forward annual leave entitlements from future work periods.  The government has encouraged employers to support workers with leave requests at this difficult time and those with underlying health conditions should be facilitated where possible.</p>  <p>  The Return to Work Safely Protocol provides that if an at-risk or vulnerable worker cannot work from home and must be in the workplace, employers must make sure that they are preferentially supported to maintain a physical distance of 2 metres.  However, employers should enable vulnerable workers to work from home where possible.</p>  <p>  In general, if people have additional expenses related to their illness or they are struggling financially, they can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance which is a means-tested payment. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

Within this group there is likely to be a considerable diversity of applicants, many of whom may be catered for through different pathways  - for example, those who deferred a place last year, those applying as mature students, those applying through access pathways and those with FET qualifications. </p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years.</p>  <p>  For the 2020 CAO system to proceed to pave the way for entry to higher education for the majority of applicants within the current timelines, and in a manner than can be properly upheld, 2020 results and the results of leaving certificate examinations from previous years must be treated equally in the CAO system.  To complete the CAO system in any other way could serve to wholly undermine it.</p>  <p>  In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system, I have announced the creation of an additional 1,250 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places are provided in order to help ease anxiety and reduce uncertainty among students awaiting a CAO offer. Active engagement is currently underway with a view to providing further additional places in light of issues such as those the Deputy raises.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there will be fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year, which will depend on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more uncertainty than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  The first indication regarding movements of CAO points will not be clear until the completion of the first round process on Friday 11 September. My Department will continue to monitor development in collaboration with the higher education sector and the Department of Education.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p>  <p>  For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  Where an applicant or a party to a student grant application is in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or the Temporary wage Subsidy Scheme, the awarding authority SUSI will assess each case on its own merits and determine whether a change has occurred that satisfies the scheme. Following such a review under the change in circumstances provision, an applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF).</p>  <p>  The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

Students pay a student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum which can be paid in instalments.  </p>  <p>  The state pays the contribution in full or part for an estimated 44 per cent of all students eligible for free fees funding through SUSI. The estimated cost was in the order of &euro;180million for 2019/2020. </p>  <p>  Student contribution funded by the state is in addition to over &euro;340million paid for student tuition fees in 2019/20 through our free fees initiative.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to develop a long-term sustainable funding model for higher level education.  In addition I intend to specifically examine student supports to ensure all students have access to educational opportunities and supports that will help them to fulfil their potential. </p>  <p>  While the balance of costs and benefits of Higher Education will be considered as part of the broader strategic reform of higher education funding, the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on students and families has been the subject of immediate attention.  </p>  <p>  In July I announced &euro;168 million in funding to support the sector and students including a &euro;15million fund for technology supports, a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund and &euro;5 million for mental health supports.</p>  <p>  The pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on younger workers and those in lower paid occupations. In the July Stimulus Package we provided &euro;100m in funding for the tertiary education and training sector to help support upskilling and reskilling, which will fund over 35,000 places in 2020. </p>  <p>  Covid-19 requirements mean that the delivery of third level education costs more, not less. As a consequence the Government has provided a major increase in funding to meet those costs but also to significantly enhance the range of supports available to students particularly those with the least financial  resources.</p></reply>

However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. </p>  <p>  However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme.  The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. SUSI also requires confirmation that the change is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant. The applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing support@susi.ie.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes, the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate Higher Education students with students paying the student contribution.</p>  <p>  The student contribution fee is currently set at &euro;3,000 per annum and can be paid in instalments. In 2019/20 nearly 62,000 students had all of part of their student contribution paid by the Exchequer through SUSI.  I have acknowledged that the current rate is too high and a reduction of the rate will be considered over the lifetime of the Government. The potential amendments will be considered as part of the strategic reform of higher education funding and in view of the objective of ensuring access to and continued participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds and from families who have been disproportionately impacted by Covid. Examination of the student contribution will focus on how best to alleviate this cost to ensure that the critical role of higher education in ensuring all students achieving their potential is maximised.</p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund, which assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the difficulties being experienced by students and their families as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting students and families who are putting their children through further and higher education.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.  </p>  <p>  For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  In relation to payment of student grants, to ensure students receive their first payment as soon as possible, SUSI will make weekly payments from October 9. For the academic year 2020-21, the first payment will be made sooner after colleges commence than in previous years. </p>  <p>  In order for students to receive the necessary supports when they return to education this autumn, four scheduled maintenance payments will be made before the end of December, with two payments scheduled to be made in October. </p>  <p>  Students in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) are not eligible for maintenance support under the Student Grant Scheme, as this would result in a duplication of income support payments. However, students in receipt of BTEA may be considered for SUSI fee supports up to a maximum of &euro;6,270.</p>  <p>  Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP). Further enquiries in respect of the BTEA should be referred to DEASP. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie. </p></reply>

The funding for higher and further education and training to address this situation amounts to &euro;100m and will fund over 35,000 additional student places in the current year.</p>  <p>  The Further Education Strategy 2020-24 is a good example of where the engagement between relevant stakeholders, such as industry, has fed into the development of the SOLAS Further Education Strategy to cover the next 5 years. At the Higher Education level, a key tenet of Technological Universities, (TU&rsquo;s) is their research-informed teaching and learning based on interactions with industry and relationships forged with local and regional enterprise stakeholders. TU&rsquo;s also play a pivotal role in facilitating access and progression particularly through relationships with the further education  sector. The presence of a technological university in a region, with a specific mandate for promoting regional development, will have a transformative effect on local and regional communities.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to design and develop education programmes and qualifications that reflect what is required in the workplace. We will continue working with all stakeholders to address current needs and looking beyond the current world of work prepare individuals to succeed in the existing and future labour market and avail of future job opportunities.</p></reply>

The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation as a destination for a successful research career. Equally, increased participation in higher education has resulted in significant contributions to society and has played a critical role in enriching our cultural life. Our next generation of researchers and innovators require the best possible foundation from our higher education system.</p><p>Postgraduate education delivered by the higher education institutions is critical to our research system. In addition to contributing to knowledge, postgraduate researcher education drives participants to develop their own research skills that can be applied in a range of environments, in academia or industry, at home or abroad. </p><p>Every year, approximately 10,000 research students are enrolled across all institutions, and they form a key element in the transformation of Institutes of Technology into Technological Universities and are  a continuing critical feature of our universities. </p><p>The Irish Research Council funds graduates across all disciplines, and are an important component in the wider national strategic pursuit of strong talent pipeline of research graduates coming through Ireland&rsquo;s higher education system.

These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands.</p>  <p>  Structures such as the National Skills Council, the Regional Skills Fora, the National Training Fund Advisory Group and the Apprenticeship Council help identify and respond to skills needs and ensure that we have a national and regional labour force equipped with the skills that will attract international jobs to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Human Capital Initiative (HCI) provides additional capacity across the Higher Education Sector to meet priority skill needs for enterprise, representing an additional investment of &euro;300m (&euro;60m per annum from 2020 to 2024) from the surplus in the NTF in line with recommendations contained in the independent review of the NTF on the use of the surplus and the development of labour market skills. Pillar 2 provides for the provision of 3,000 new places in key areas of enterprise skills needs including, but not limited to, Science, Engineering, ICT and Professional Construction. 1,415 of these places will be made available for the 2020 academic year.</p>  <p>  The July Stimulus package is a programme of immediate investment in upskilling, reskilling and refreshing of skills needs to be supported throughout working lives.  The funding for higher and further education and training to address this situation amounts to &euro;100m and will fund over 35,000 additional student places in the current year.</p>  <p>  The Further Education Strategy 2020-24 is a good example of where the engagement between relevant stakeholders, such as industry, has fed into the development of the SOLAS Further Education Strategy to cover the next 5 years. At the Higher Education level, a key tenet of Technological Universities, (TU&rsquo;s) is their research-informed teaching and learning based on interactions with industry and relationships forged with local and regional enterprise stakeholders. TU&rsquo;s also play a pivotal role in facilitating access and progression particularly through relationships with the further education  sector. The presence of a technological university in a region, with a specific mandate for promoting regional development, will have a transformative effect on local and regional communities.</p>  <p>  Springboard+ complements the core State-funded education and training system and provides free or 90% funded upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills needs. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to design and develop education programmes and qualifications that reflect what is required in the workplace. We will continue working with all stakeholders to address current needs and looking beyond the current world of work prepare individuals to succeed in the existing and future labour market and avail of future job opportunities.</p></reply>

Its successor strategy, which will be developed by my Department, will set out a renewed vision for research and innovation in Ireland. The new strategy will be developed in consultation with all other relevant Government departments and agencies and will reaffirm the need for sustained and increased public and private investment in research, development and innovation (RDI). </p><p>A number of areas of key importance to the next strategy have already emerged in early discussions, including key thematic challenges such as climate change, digitalisation and public health and the many cross-cutting issues that are essential for a well- functioning, fit for purpose RDI system. Climate change in particular has emerged as a key challenge which the R&amp;amp;I ecosystem can play a significant role in addressing.</p><p>The challenges posed by and the impact of COVID-19 on our society and our economy has demonstrated the importance of scientific research, expertise and the ability to innovate to adapt to an ever changing world. It is clear that now, more than ever, that we need investment in research, development and innovation in order to find solutions to our key societal and economic challenges, not only with regard to COVID-19 but also the other challenges I have already mentioned. </p></reply>

This dedicated funding is additional to the &euro;31 million in Exchequer funding invested in TU development and progression to date.</p><p>Under the statutory framework provided in the Technological Universities Act 2018, two or more IoTs may jointly seek TU designation through a prescribed legislative process. Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by two or more applicant institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU subject to their jointly meeting specified eligibility criteria.  Section 38 of the 2018 Act provides that an applicant institute and an established technological university may apply to the Minister for an order. </p><p>As autonomous higher education institutes established under statute, it remains a matter for the governing body of an IoT to set the institute&rsquo;s  particular strategic direction within the higher education landscape, including whether or not to seek TU designation through the prescribed legal processes.</p><p>In June 2020, Dundalk Institute of Technology (DKIT) launched a new three-year strategic plan which articulates it&rsquo;s mission to be a leader for higher education and craft apprenticeships, and the engine for growth and social cohesion in North Leinster-South Ulster through the achievement of TU status and strengthened cross-border alliances. In this context the Department understands that DKIT has been in discussions with a number of TU development consortia.</p><p>The HEA is currently involved in a process with eligible higher education institutions to ascertain funding requirements under the new TU Transformation Fund towards 2023. In this context the HEA has indicated its willingness to work with and support DKIT to facilitate a process to place the institute on a trajectory in line with their stated ambition to pursue TU status.  Formal submissions under the fund were made to the HEA at the end of August 2020. The HEA is currently reviewing these and considering future funding allocations, with a view to making allocations in October.</p></reply>

Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p>  <p>  My Department chairs an Interdepartmental Working Group on Student Accommodation. This group contains representatives from Higher Education Institutions, the Union of Students in Ireland and a number of government departments. It is intended to convene a meeting of this group shortly to discuss the accommodation issues faced by students due to COVID-19. This meeting with help determine any actions necessary in relation to student accommodation, including in relation to engagement with private accommodation providers.</p>  <p>  I have asked our higher education institutions, where they have accommodation, to try to show flexibility in terms of its use. Several of them are doing so, while others are constrained by students having already booked accommodation. I would wish for private providers to show the same flexibility, however it is not within my remit to issue instruction in relation to the private rental market.</p></reply>

The amount of ASC charged to apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time spent in the institution during the academic year. In cases where training is delivered in an Education and Training Board there is no contribution made by the apprentice. </p>  <p>  For craft apprenticeships, the ASC charged is pro-rated to the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT/TU Dublin.  Craft apprentices typically spend two blocks of time (Phase 4 &amp;amp; 6) in a HEI. In the case of the new consortia led apprenticeships the contribution varies for each programme as their off-the-job training has a more flexible structure.   </p>  <p>  The removal of the ASC for apprentices in full would result in an estimated cost of &euro;4.8 million per annum to the State.  A 50% reduction in the ASC for apprentices would cost an estimated &euro;2.4 million and a 20% reduction in the ASC for apprentices would cost an estimated &euro;960,000.</p></reply>

All cancelled appointments were rescheduled and an additional 1,000 appointments issued through July and August. It is planned to significantly increase capacity over the coming months. </p><p>My Department is aware that there have been issues in the past around the securing of registration appointments and a set of software fixes were introduced in late 2018, designed to prevent such abuses of the system. The new measures have been successful to date in preventing the block booking of appointments by third party agents. However, there are some third party agents providing appointment booking services in return for payment on the basis that the person provides them with their personal details in advance. The Immigration Service Delivery function of my Department have strongly advised against this practice of providing sensitive and personal data to unregulated and unknown third parties.</p></reply>

Currently there are approximately 21,000 applications on hand, at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received by the Citizenship Division to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony. </p>  <p>  All applicants 18 years and older must attend at a citizenship ceremony in order to make a declaration of fidelity to the State, administered by a Presiding Officer, normally a retired member of the Judiciary.  As a result of these restrictions, the Citizenship Division have experienced significant disruption in delivering its core functions.  Working within these restrictions, public safety and the wellbeing of staff are of course both urgent priorities.</p>  <p>  The pilot virtual Citizenship Ceremony that took place on 10 July 2020, involved 21 applicants.  As I indicated at that time, a review was underway and consideration of that review is now in its final stages.  </p>  <p>  As I have said previously, a critical consideration is the protection of the welfare and safety of the participants and the general public.  It is also essential that any arrangements put in place ensure that the event is held with an appropriate degree of dignity and solemnity, as befits an event of such importance in the lives of our newest citizens.  At this same time, it is not desirable for extended delays to become a feature of the system, while having regard to the practical aspects of the citizenship process. As a consequence, a critical aspect of the review concerns the ability to provide a scalable solution. The ceremony model will need to be able to meet the requirements of applicants and my Department for an as yet indeterminate period of time.  My intention is to make a decision as to how to proceed shortly. </p>  <p>  It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow.</p></reply>

While we are examining their application, all applicants are offered accommodation and other supports such as healthcare, education for children and a weekly payment for personal expenditure. The provision of accommodation is demand-led, based on the number of applicants arriving to claim international protection and requiring accommodation.</p>  <p>  My Department maintains statistics of the number of residents housed in each centre on a weekly basis.  However, the configuration of each centre and the room makeup is constantly changing as new applicants are placed in accommodation; people with a status or permission to remain move to accommodation in the community; and transfers take place between accommodation centres. </p>  <p>  Therefore, my Department does not maintain statistics on the room configuration of the accommodation centres.  It has not been possible in the time available to compile the data requested and to do so would require significant diversion of resources.  However, I can provide the following information in respect of occupancy of our accommodation centres, including emergency accommodation as of 12 August 2020.  At that time, there were 709 rooms containing two unrelated people sharing and 131 rooms containing 3 unrelated people sharing in our accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  We have ensured at this time that no more than three unrelated people are sharing a room in any of our centres and that will remain our policy when the COVID-19 crisis is over.  </p>  <p>  In general, the criteria for the allocation of single occupancy rooms would be a medical requirement and/or a disability or a particular vulnerability.  In addition, during the current pandemic, persons self-isolating or cocooning would be allocated single occupancy rooms if they are not part of a family group.</p></reply>

The scoping exercise will gather and assess information relating to the ongoing challenges and needs experienced by communities in Drogheda, and identify opportunities to connect, support and strengthen services, including those for young people, in the area. </p>  <p>  Mr Geiran will look at the areas of community safety, policing, the impact of substance abuse, and drug-debt intimidation, but also at community development needs, the existing service landscape, including facilities for families and children&rsquo;s services, the physical environment, and education and employment opportunities. </p>  <p>  I met with Mr Geiran last week to discuss his work and to assure him of my absolute support and commitment to this project. Mr Geiran has now commenced work which will take between six and ten weeks to complete, during which time Mr Geiran will be gathering information and assessing the scale and nature of the problem there in order to map the services available and identify any gaps. </p>  <p>  Mr Geiran will engage with residents, service providers including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, businesses and other members of the community and draw on their local knowledge and understanding of the problems to identify key opportunities for action. </p>  <p>  The issues in Drogheda have on occasion spilled over into neighbouring areas and where relevant to the scoping exercise, they will be taken into account.</p>  <p>  I can assure you that this scoping exercise will be the foundation for a comprehensive response to the issues in Drogheda, and I will await its results with interest.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country. </p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. To date, 29 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;689,000. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>However in all cases, grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.  </p><p>In relation to the applications from Cork referred to by the Deputy, I am advised by my officials that my Department has to date received no applications from this area. Therefore there have been no applications approved nor are there any on hand awaiting approval. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.</p></reply>

It is essential that clinical placements can now re-commence for all healthcare students in line with the requirements of their courses and to ensure the continuation of a sustainable workforce into the future. </p>  <p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that guidance on the resumption of clinical placements  was recently issued by the Chief Clinical Officer of the HSE to all Higher Education Institutes and copied to healthcare providers. This guidance included a revised version ( dated 17 August, 2020) of the HSE's document - Infection Prevention and Control Requirements for Clinical Placements in HSE facilities in the context of COVID-19. This document, among other things, sets out the requirement for Infection Prevention and Control Training for all students. It also underlines that clinical placements are an essential part of students' education and training, ensuring that they will continue to receive the breath of clinical experience that they require.</p>  <p>  According to this guidance, students can move from a placement in one setting to a placement in another without an interval of time, provided they complete a COVID-19 Healthcare Worker Relocation Self Risk Assessment prior to commencing in a different location. Similarly, if a student continues part-time work in a healthcare setting during the same period as attending clinical placements, they are required to complete this self-assessment on an ongoing basis so that any need for testing may be identified. The guidance makes it clear that students should not present on clinical placement if they have any symptoms of acute infection. Overall, the guidance facilitates students in completing their education and training and in doing so it does not preclude them from working part time so long as they adhere to the infection prevention and control requirements. In terms of financial supports there is a travel/accommodation allowance which amounts to &euro;50.79 a week to support those students to access the clinical placements they require.</p></reply>

This freed up resources at Tallaght to support the adult service there in responding to the demands of COVID. This temporary change allowed for some CHI staff on a voluntary basis to work in the adult services supporting their colleagues including in ICU during this very challenging period for the health services.</p>  <p>  This was a temporary measure, and paediatric services at Tallaght have now resumed. CHI advises this began with the return of outpatients in July. A 24/7 emergency care unit, medical inpatient care and day case surgery, medicine and x-ray resumed on site from 3 September.</p>  <p>  Tallaght will now take on increased day surgeries instead of resuming in-patient surgeries, which will create theatre capacity in Temple St and Crumlin for surgeries that can only be undertaken in those hospitals. Additionally, critically ill and critically injured children will be directed to the CHI Emergency Departments at Crumlin and Temple Street. </p>  <p>  Patient safety is central to CHI&rsquo;s decision making, both in the provision and development of services. This approach is designed to ensure that resources across all CHI sites at Tallaght, Crumlin, Temple Street and Connolly are utilised as effectively as possible to maximise the level of service provided and ensure the delivery of safe, high quality services.  This is crucial in the context of what is expected to be a challenging winter for paediatric services. </p></reply>

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. </p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and a Rare Disease Office.  Building on this progress to date, themes for inclusion in a roadmap for the coming period have been agreed with the Rare Disease Task Force, which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland, the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI).  The Rare Disease Plan is now firmly embedded in the work of the HSE Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office. This programme is under the governance of the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. </p>  <p>  Meetings, to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the continuing work ongoing in relation to Rare Diseases take place at regular intervals with the Rare Disease Task Force, the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Rare Disease Office. </p>  <p>  A number of key themes have now been identified for progression in the coming period, including: Patient Awareness; European Reference Networks; Research &amp;amp; Registries; Access to Services; Access to Medicines; Diagnosis; Education &amp;amp; Training and Legislation &amp;amp; Policy. This will form the basis for work in this area in the time ahead.</p></reply>

The Government is finalising decisions on the associated funding for this measure and the implementation date for the commencement of this provision.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 also provides for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under. The initial stage of this phased expansion will be the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing access to GP care without charges for children, an important healthcare measure that will remove a potentially prohibitive cost barrier to accessing GP care and will help to improve children&rsquo;s health as they develop.</p>  <p>  The appropriate date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and in anticipation of the usual increase in demand for healthcare services over the winter period. This date will be determined in consultation with the IMO. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

All of those in the at-risk groups aged from 6 months up, including healthcare workers, will be able to access the vaccination without charges.  All children aged from 2 to 12 years inclusive will also have access to vaccination without charges.</p>  <p>  The total influenza vaccination programme in 2020 is expected to cost approximately &euro;77 million, with approximately &euro;61.5 million of that cost associated with the expansion of the programme. It is not possible to estimate the cost of expanding the influenza program to provide vaccine administration without charge to the entire population, as the calculation would depend on too many variables such as the type and quantity of vaccine to be procured as well as the rate of vaccine uptake.</p>  <p>  The HSE has placed orders for 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine will be made available to all persons in an at-risk group from 6 months up, other than children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive. The HSE has also ordered 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine, which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and will be made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  The total quantity of vaccine ordered for the upcoming winter season is a substantial increase on the 1.15 million doses of Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine which was contracted for purchase for the 2019/2020 winter season. It is difficult to accurately estimate the rate of vaccine uptake for the upcoming winter season, although a higher demand for the influenza vaccine than in previous years is anticipated due to the emergence of COVID-19. The quantities of vaccine ordered are expected to be sufficient to meet even this increased level of demand.</p></reply>

This Act provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under. The initial stage of this phased expansion will be the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8. </p>  <p>  Funding in respect of the expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8, as well as other measures provided under the Act, was provided for within the Budget 2020 package of family friendly measures, which amounted to &euro;45m in total.  </p>  <p>  Introduction of the expansion of GP care without fees will be the subject of negotiation with the IMO, representing general practitioners, in regard to the scope of services to be provided under the expansion and the fees payable to GPs; the exact cost will depend on the outcome of those negotiations. For this reason, it is not possible to estimate the cost of expanding GP care without charges to all children under 18, as such an expansion would also be subject to negotiations with the IMO and the cost would depend on the outcome of those negotiations. </p>  <p>  The appropriate date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and in anticipation of the usual increase in demand for healthcare services over the winter period. This date will be determined in consultation with the IMO. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s natural protection as an island and recognition of both its pest free status and, as a special protected zone under EU plant law, has helped to ensure so far, that this beetle and many others have been kept out of the country. However, experience continues to demonstrate that bark beetles can be found even under a very small piece of bark on a log in a consignment of any size which is why we need to be vigilant.</p>  <p>  Regarding the import requirements, debarking is not an acceptable import standard and it should not be confused with the &ldquo;bark-free&rdquo; requirement. The &ldquo;bark-free&rdquo; requirement means exactly what it states &ndash; that is the logs must be 100% free of bark.</p>  <p>Bark-free wood is Wood from which all bark  , except ingrown bark around knots and bark pockets between rings of annual growth, has been removed [ISPM 15, 2002; revised CPM, 2008]</p>  <p>  Any prospective importer is reminded to engage fully with the Department for guidance on import requirements and for Departmental inspection arrangements. </p>  <p>  It is entirely the importer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure the import meets the standards required and the Department will closely inspect consignments on arrival at quayside to verify these standards are satisfied. Because of the potential risk involved, meticulous inspection of consignments is required and non-compliant loads i.e. loads that include any logs with any bark, will not be allowed to discharge. Importers should give this careful consideration when planning and costing a proposed import of logs declared as bark-free.</p></reply>
