For example it outlines that by 2030:</p><p>- Renewable Energy will be 5 times its existing capacity.</p><p>- Retrofitting of homes will be 10 times its present level</p><p>- Non-recyclable plastics will have been eliminated.</p><p>On the other hand it also highlights:</p><p>- the ending of the use of peat and coal in electricity generation</p><p>- the end of new sales of combustion engine cars</p><p>- the need to retrofit 500,000 homes to B2 standard.</p><p>All of these represent economic and social challenges to adapt, to change habits, to mobilise capital and to build new infrastructures. These challenges are reflected in both the recent budget and the National Development Plan.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan clearly recognises that reducing our greenhouse gas emissions has the potential to have a disproportionate impact on different groups in society. It is essential that the burdens borne across groups are seen to be equitable, and that everyone is making an appropriate and fair level of effort. Enabling a just transition to a climate resilient and low carbon society, while protecting the most vulnerable in this process, is at the heart of the Climate Action Plan.</p><p>In the recent budget a decision was made to gradually raise carbon price to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030 and to ensure that all of that money be used to support those least equipped to make the transition, to provide a just transition for those most exposed and to empower communities to make important changes. These include:</p><p>- An increase in fuel allowance</p><p>- doubling investment in retrofitting for low income families</p><p>- a package of just transition focused immediately on the midlands</p><p>- new support to accelerate the uptake of retrofitting, switch to electric and alternative transport modes.</p><p>The Plan sets out an ongoing programme of work to assess the economic and employment implications of the transition to a low-carbon economy and tasks the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) with establishing a Just Transition Review Group to identify specific transition needs among cohorts of workers, communities and specific groups of people. NESC will also prepare periodic strategic advice to Government on the Just Transition. The first such report is to be prepared by the end of 2020.</p></reply>

A wide a varied range of responses were received to the consultation, from members of the public, NGOs, industry and government agencies. These responses were published on 27 June 2019 and form a vital input into the development of the Bill. Furthermore, a thematic analysis of the submissions identifying key themes and issues was published on 25 July 2019.</p>  <p>  This Bill will set a clear expectation for online platforms to take robust steps to ensure the safety of the users of their service and will provide for the appointment of an Online Safety Commissioner as part of the regulatory structure overseeing the new system. It will also provide for the implementation of the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive in Ireland, which sets out new EU rules for Video Sharing Platform Services.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently pursuing an extensive programme of policy analysis to inform decision making around preparatory drafts of heads of the Bill. I intend to bring the draft heads to Government by end-2019.</p>  <p>  While it would be impossible to protect people from every danger online, this Bill will ensure, for the first time, that robust regulation is in place and end the era of self-regulation by online platforms.</p></reply>

Providing a warmer, more comfortable home that is cheaper to run will protect these homeowners in the long term.</p><p>In addition we shall be working with DHLG to deliver an aggregated area based model of retrofitting in the midlands. &euro;20m will also be dedicated to the creation of a new energy efficiency scheme as committed to in the Climate Action Plan.

The scheme, which is funded by my Department and operated by the SEAI, closed for applications on 19 July. The total budget for the scheme this year is &euro;10 million &ndash; double the amount spent on the scheme last year. Almost &euro;2 million has been paid in grants under the scheme so far this year. All applications received in advance of the July 19 deadline are being evaluated and honoured in line with the scheme terms and conditions.</p>  <p>  While the Deep Retrofit Pilot is now closed to new applications, a number of other grants for energy efficiency works remain available. Information on these grants is available from the SEAI website. Since 2000, over 400,000 homeowners have received direct support under these schemes to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. This year &euro;100 million has been allocated to these schemes.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan sets an ambitious target of 500,000 energy efficiency retrofits by 2030. Achievement of this target will be supported by the Project Ireland 2040 allocation of &euro;3.7 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the Plan.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has allocated &euro;146 million for retrofitting homes and businesses. This will support the upgrade of 24,000 properties in 2020. This record level of investment is an important step towards realising the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan targets for building retrofits. </p></reply>

The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable. Immediate action was needed to ensure the survival of An Post and the post office network. </p>  <p>  As a result of the actions taken by Government, An Post has been able to construct and begin implementing a strategic plan for a sustainable future. Government remains fully committed to a sustainable post office network which is a key piece of economic and social infrastructure for both rural and urban areas. Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, a &euro;30 million loan was provided by the Government to An Post to support the required transformation programme.</p>  <p>  The An Post strategic plan includes measures such as investing &euro;50 million in growing and modernising the post office network; splitting the company into two distinct business units, namely, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail; relaunching its parcel business following a breakthrough labour agreement; and diversifying and growing its financial service products.</p>  <p>  Decisions relating to the Post Office Network, including plans for individual post offices, are an operational matter for the Board and management of An Post and I have no statutory function in relation to these issues. </p>  <p>  An Post has been diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products; local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products.</p>  <p>  An Post recently launched two new dedicated sub-brands:</p>  <p>  An Post Money offers an expanded range of financial services including credit cards, personal loans, current account (debit card) and multi-currency FX card across its network and through the website.</p>  <p>  An Post Commerce provides expert e-commerce, mails and mail media solutions for domestic and international businesses.</p>  <p>  Government business is the backbone of the post office network. In April 2018 the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments at post offices. </p>  <p>  As part of its consideration of the financial position of An Post, the Government agreed that further opportunities for Government business through the Post Office Network, including the payment of motor tax, should be explored. </p></reply>

A comprehensive set of actions (Actions 16 to 24) have been published for delivery by a range of agencies and include ensuring that ESB Networks and EirGrid plan the network and deliver on connecting renewable energy sources to meet the 2030 70% RES-E target. Specifically, the facilitation of additional hybrid connections operating in the electricity market to increase our RES-E penetration is required. In addition, delivery of a fit for purpose renewables connection policy is critical to deliver on renewable energy targets with annual reporting on the timelines of grid connection. </p>  <p>  Subsidy free renewable energy through corporate power purchase agreements provide a route to market for developers in the shorter term providing them with a real opportunity to boost Ireland's renewable energy capacity in advance of the commencement of RESS. The Climate Plan commits to a 15% target for the renewable industry to develop projects through power purchase agreements. It is critical that the industry takes early action to meet this target in contributing to both our 2020 and 2030 targets at minimum cost to consumers. </p></reply>

By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps. Currently over 99% of our vehicle fleet is powered by fossil fuels. By 2030, nearly a million fully electric or hybrid vehicles (35%-40%) will be on our roads. These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants. </p>  <p>  Extending the ban on the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas. </p>  <p>  The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to our major cities. </p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. </p>  <p>  Regarding the proposed national extension of the smoky coal ban, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban. </p>  <p>  This is particularly disappointing, given the impact poor air quality can have on human health and the environment and the emphasis the Government is putting on transitioning to a low carbon society. </p>  <p>  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these products produce similar levels of pollution. The legal threat is not only to take down any new nationwide ban, but to remove the existing ban which is currently in place in cities and many towns around the country. </p>  <p>  The Attorney General has provided legal advice on this matter. I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan, which will improve air quality by reducing air pollution, without jeopardising the existing ban. </p>  <p>  I also intend to publish a Clean Air Strategy, which will set out a number of policies to improve air quality nationwide in the coming months. </p>  <p>  My Department is also funding the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s roll-out of the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), which will greatly improve the data available on air pollution in Ireland, facilitating the design and targeting of appropriate policy measures to tackle it.</p></reply>

In addition, &euro;4 million was provided to support the installation of home chargers (including chargers in apartment blocks from early 2020) and &euro;2 million to support the rollout of on-street chargers across the country via Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  There is a the wide range of supports already available to incentivise the uptake of electric vehicles including purchase grants, tax reliefs, home charger grants, accelerated capital allowances for businesses, low motor tax and discounted tolls. Budget 2020 extended the benefit-in-kind tax relief for battery electric vehicles to 2022 and the vehicle registration tax relief of up to &euro;2,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to 2020. </p>  <p>  In August, I announced funding to support the rollout of up to 1,000 on-street public charge points for electric vehicles over the next 5 years. With the additional funding provided in Budget 2020, support is available for up to 400 on-street chargers in 2020. All Local Authorities can now apply for funding to the SEAI for this support to develop on-street charging infrastructure. </p>  <p>  In addition, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB ecars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. This project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models. This is a multi-annual project that will see investment across the country and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. </p>  <p>  Businesses, including service stations, can already avail of accelerated capital allowances for the purchase and installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This enables businesses to invest in energy efficient equipment, including electric charging infrastructure, and write down the cost of such equipment in the year of purchase rather than over 8 years. </p>  <p>  Home charging is the primary method of charging for the majority of electric vehicles both internationally and in Ireland. Charging at home at night is the most cost-effective and eco-friendly way to charge an electric vehicle. With a high proportion of homes, both in rural and urban areas, with driveways and dedicated parking spaces, Ireland has greater capacity for home charging than many other countries. A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers. </p></reply>

It will also help us to move towards 70% renewable electricity. A resilient and well connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic wellbeing and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>  <p>  As I understand the situation in Northern Ireland, in January 2018 full planning permission was granted for the section of the line that lies there. Legal proceedings were taken against the planning permission and in February 2019 the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland asked the High Court to quash the planning permission given so the planning application could be re-determined under new legislation introduced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in November 2018. On 24 July SONI/EirGrid submitted an addendum to the Environmental Statement to the Department for Infrastructure. That Department subsequently carried out a consultation process in Northern Ireland to provide members of the public with the opportunity to review and comment on the addendum and is now reviewing the submissions received. </p>  <p>  Since the suspension of Stormont the office of the Minister for the Economy is vacant.

Government has committed to delivering a whole of Government approach, and to working with local stakeholders, to ensuring that a just transition is provided to those impacted by the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>  <p>  Further details of this comprehensive whole of Government response to support the region through the transition will be announced shortly. Budget 2020 includes a number of measures that form part of this response. These include:</p>  <p>  - &euro;6 million for a Just Transition Fund;</p>  <p>  - &euro;5 million for bog restoration and rehabilitation; and</p>  <p>  - &euro;20 million to deliver a new model to group housing upgrades. </p>  <p>  The Just Transition Fund will be initially targeted at the Midlands and will support retraining and reskilling workers and assist local communities and businesses in the Midlands to adjust to the low carbon transition. There will be further engagement with local stakeholders, including the Midlands Transition Team, on the application of the funding. </p>  <p>  The bog restoration and rehabilitation fund will support the National Parks and Wildlife Service to restore to their natural habitat 1,800 hectares of bog. This restoration will return these bogs to carbon sinks once more, which, over the next 5 years, will result in 28 million tonnes of carbon being stored. 70 jobs will be created in Year One, rising to 100 as the programme develops. </p>  <p>  The delivery of a new model to group housing upgrades together is set out in the Climate Action Plan. the &euro;20m allocated in the budget will be targeted at the Midlands and will support an estimated 400 jobs directly and indirectly, as well as significantly upgrading the social housing stock in the region during 2020. </p>  <p>  I have also announced that a Just Transition Commissioner will be appointed. This Commissioner will engage with all relevant stakeholders in the Midlands, including Bord na M&oacute;na, the Midland Regional Transition Team, Trade Unions as well as the National Economic and Social Council (NESC). This appointment will be part of the Government&rsquo;s Just Transition Plan, which is currently being led by the Department of An Taoiseach. Further details on this role will be provided as part of an announcement on the All-of-Government response to support the Midlands region through the transition. </p></reply>

This was preceded on Saturday, 21 September, by the Youth Climate Summit which I attended along with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Ireland&rsquo;s national statement to the Climate Action Summit, delivered by the Taoiseach, confirmed that the Government would accept and act upon the advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council in relation to the future of oil and natural gas offshore exploration and recovery. In this regard, it was accepted that the exploration for, and the recovery of, new offshore oil reserves is not compatible with a low carbon transition, and that the exploration for, and extraction of new offshore gas reserves, can be consistent with this transition. I will shortly bring proposals to Government to set out the next steps in terms of how this advice is to be implemented.</p><p>Ireland also announced that all new revenue raised from the carbon tax will be ring-fenced to fund additional climate action, with a particular emphasis on protecting the vulnerable and ensuring a just transition, including protecting those most exposed to higher fuel and energy costs, and providing alternative opportunities for displaced workers. Specific details on how the additional carbon tax revenue will be used, and the specific schemes identified, were announced by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in the Budget.</p><p>As part of the preparation for the summit on Youth Engagement and Public Mobilisation, Ireland and the Marshall Irelands jointly sponsored the preparation of the 'Kwon Gesh' (or &quot;Solemn Duty&quot;) climate pledge, which invites its signatories to give the younger generation a greater voice in creating climate policy. </p><p>Parties to the summit were invited to make new commitments under a number of different themes, include climate mitigation; resilience and adaptation; climate finance and carbon pricing; social and political drivers; energy transition; nature-based solutions; infrastructure, cities and local government; industry; and youth engagement and public mobilisation. Ireland has confirmed support for a number of initiatives under following themes set out as follows.</p><p>1. Mitigation Strategy Coalition</p><p>Ireland was included on a list of countries and non-Party stakeholders that demonstrated genuine leadership either by having developed plans to achieve net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, by having identified this target as a long-term national goal or by advancing consultations on a long-term strategy for climate-neutrality in line with the Paris Agreement. </p><p>2.

In this regard, I instructed my officials to enquire from the EU Commission at the PCI selection process High Level Decision Making Body meeting in Brussels on 4 October whether the implications of importing LNG to the European Union, from conventional and unconventional fracked sources, have been examined in terms of a sustainable, secure and competitive European energy policy. The Commission advised that it had launched a study on methane emissions and agreed with the need to link gas imports to the objective of a climate neutral economy.</p>  <p>  The Government has a fundamental duty to protect Ireland&rsquo;s energy security. As we move towards the target set out in the Climate Action Plan of 70% renewable electricity by 2030, natural gas will continue to be an important fuel in the transition away from coal, peat and oil to more sustainable sources of energy. </p>  <p>  I have initiated a comprehensive energy security review that will consider the electricity generation mix including the role for gas powered back up generation, battery storage and interconnection (both gas and electricity), and other ways to back up our power supply. The review will also consider, in a scientific way, how and from where fossil fuels are sourced during the transition to a carbon neutral economy once completed, I will publish the review and would welcome the consideration of the Dail and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action.</p></reply>

These include:</p>  <p>  - The provision of an annual waste enforcement grant of &euro;7.4 million to support the recruitment and retention of 150 local authority waste enforcement personnel across the country;</p>  <p>  - The establishment of Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities to support and co-ordinate local authority action at a cost of &euro;1 million per annum;</p>  <p>  - The establishment of a National Waste Enforcement Steering Committee, which facilitates the deployment of co-ordinated multi agency responses to illegal waste activity across the regions.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has developed the Anti-Dumping Initiative to encourage local authorities to work in partnership with community organisations to identify high-risk or problem areas, develop appropriate enforcement responses and carry out necessary clean-up operations. Since 2017, funding of &euro;3.3 million has been made available which has supported more than 400 projects across all 31 local authority areas, remediating blackspots, while equipping local authority waste enforcement officers with the latest technologies available to tackle this problem.</p>  <p>  I allocated a further &euro;3 million for the 2019 Anti-Dumping Initiative, an increase of 50% on last year, in order to continue to support communities around the country in their efforts. This funding is supporting over 280 projects, many of an innovative nature. Funds will be distributed to local authorities shortly and details of this year's allocations and the projects funded during 2017 and 2018 can be accessed on my Department's website at: www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/topics/waste/enforcement/anti-dumping-initiative/Pages/AntiDumpingInitiative.aspx.</p></reply>

This award is subject to contract close. The finalisation of financial closure and legal requirements are progressing towards contract award before the end of year.</p><p>The Bidder has indicated that the rollout of the NBP network will take an estimated 7 years to complete. The Bidder will publish a deployment plan after the contract is signed. </p><p>In the first year of roll out, approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) will be deployed across all counties and between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p><p>The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by the end of the second year, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p><p>With reference to County Donegal specifically, the following table indicates the most up to date statistics for the county (Q2 2019):<table><tr><th>County Name</th><th>Premises within the NBP Intervention Area </th><th>Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area </th><th>Premises within eir planned rural deployment</th></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>34,180 (33.48%)</td><td>66,800 (65.44%)</td><td>1,085 (1.06%)</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy refers to premises in Donegal that are in proximity to eir&rsquo;s high speed broadband deployment and that cannot avail of a service.

People want the devolved power-sharing institutions up and running again to represent their interests and deal with the issues and challenges that Northern Ireland faces at present, not least the issues raised by the UK exit from the European Union, however this proceeds. </p>  <p>  The functioning of the North South Ministerial Council is also urgently required, to bring together the Executive and the Government to oversee and develop co-operation on the island, and as a vital part of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  In this context, the political parties, in particular the two largest parties, must live up to their responsibilities and be open to fair and workable compromises on the small number of outstanding issues, to secure the overall interests of people in Northern Ireland and to protect and operate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement again.</p>  <p>  This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Government will continue to do everything possible to support continuing engagement and progress in discussions between the political parties, working with the UK Government in any scenario, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

From 1 May 2020 the MOT rate for MGO will be &euro;117.78 per 1,000 litres, arising from the increase of the carbon component from &euro;54.92 to &euro;70.42; the non-carbon component will not change from its current level of &euro;47.36 per 1,000 litres.  </p>  <p>  When carbon tax was increased in Budget 2012, provision was made for a tax relief for farmers to compensate them for the increase. The statutory basis for the tax relief is section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. It is available to individuals and companies that carry on a trade of farming and are entitled to claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction in respect of farm diesel.  Section 664A provides that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel) and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline). </p></reply>

Based on data provided by credit unions on the June 2019 Prudential Return credit unions hold c.&euro;13 billion in deposits and investments with c. &euro;1.8 billion held in UK credit institutions. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that under the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 (the 2016 Regulations), credit unions are permitted to invest in a prescribed list of investments including accounts in credit institutions and bank bonds issued by credit institutions (defined as a person authorised as same pursuant to Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD IV)).</p>  <p>  Based on data reported by credit unions, the Central Bank is aware that a proportion of credit union investments are held with UK entities passporting into Ireland under this Directive. Post-Brexit, the UK will become a third country (non-EU) for the purposes of the CRD IV. In the event that passporting rights no longer apply to UK credit institutions as a direct consequence of the UK withdrawing from the European Union, credit union investments with those counterparties would no longer come within a permitted class of investment under the 2016 Regulations. Under such a scenario breaches of the 2016 Regulations arising would be as a result of circumstances beyond the control of individual credit unions.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank issued a communication to credit unions on 16 October 2019 confirming that it is not expecting individual credit unions to take action on these investments now. The Central Bank proposes to put a transitional arrangement in place for such investments, if required, once it has clarity on the terms of a UK exit from the European Union.</p></reply>

The entire financial services landscape has changed utterly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.</p><p>New European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes. The capital requirements' regulation and directive, which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the setting of minimum liquidity requirements. </p><p>The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign. The overarching objective of the BRRD is to shift the cost of bank failure from taxpayers to shareholders and creditors of the institutions themselves. </p><p>The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks. The central piece of the SSM supervisory process is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under which ECB led joint supervisory teams inspect business models, internal governance, profitability and banking risks.</p><p>All of these new regulations and institutional arrangements have been designed to address the challenges of banking oversight and resolution at a European level and provide for a pro-active approach towards systemic and emergent risks at a European level.</p><p>Besides the introduction of new European and national regulations, the Central Bank too has increased its resources and has become more pro-active in addressing systemic risk.</p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations. Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted. Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted. These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders - </b></p><p>In relation to this proposal, I remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has advised in relation to the following recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal that:</p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners - </b></p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments. This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements - </b></p><p>This recommendation has been considered. These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission.

Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.   </p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its concessionary approach broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices. There were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand its scope to include products that should be standard rated, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover and reduce stress.</p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following the review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. The removal of the concession will only apply on a prospective basis and will not be applied retrospectively by Revenue.</p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. </p>  <p>  The public consultation ran from 18 April to 24 May 2019 and sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health. In total, 121 submissions were received. This included submissions from individuals, businesses, lobby groups and a political party. The results of the consultation were included in the recently published Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT. The options set out in the TSG paper are the only options available; either the standard rate is maintained, or the reduced rate is introduced. </p>  <p>  I will announce the rate of VAT for food supplements with the publication of the Finance Bill 2019.</p></reply>

The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle.</p>  <p>  A number of amendments were introduced to the REIT framework via Financial Resolution on Budget night. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the appropriate level of tax is being collected.</p>  <p>  One such amendment corrects an unintended anomaly in legislation, whereby a distribution comprised of the proceeds of a property disposal was not subject to dividend withholding tax. </p>  <p>  In addition, an existing provision whereby a deemed disposal and re-basing of property values occurs should a company cease to be a REIT has been limited to apply only where the REIT has been in operation for a minimum of 15 years.  This is in line with the original policy intention of encouraging stable long-term investment in the rental property market.</p>  <p>  In relation to the further details supplied, as the Deputy is aware, I am not at liberty, nor is it appropriate for me, to discuss the tax affairs of individual companies.</p></reply>

The shareholders of the target company are paid for the cancellation of their shares rather than for the shares themselves.  The usual stamp duty charge in respect of the sale or transfer of shares did not apply as this type of arrangement does not involve a conveyance or transfer on sale.  In contrast, a takeover of the target company by means of the direct purchase or transfer of its shares would attract a stamp duty charge at the 1% rate that applies to share sales or transfers.</p>  <p>  The new measure applies stamp duty at the rate of 1% on the value of shares that are cancelled as if an actual transfer of shares had taken place. It would not be appropriate to apply the stamp duty rate of 7.5%, which is the rate that applies to the sale or transfer of non-residential property, as the transaction is in substance the acquisition of a company&rsquo;s shares which attracts a stamp duty charge at the rate of 1%.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  Should the parents of the child, the subject of the Deputy's question, have specific concerns about his educational progress I would advise that they should, in the first instance, speak to the Principal of the school concerned, with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist for the appropriate individual intervention.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Danu Special School has now commenced the enrolment and transition process with a view to children starting in school after the mid-term break. </p><p>As the placements in the school come on stream over coming weeks, the NCSE will work closely with the School and keep in regular contact with the Parents of the children concerned.</p><p>The Home Tuition Grant is available to Parents in the interim. </p><p>I am anxious that the Principal, teachers, SNAs and other staff in the new school are appropriately supported during the challenging start-up terms. </p><p>My Department, through NEPS, the Inspectorate, the NCSE and in collaboration with the Middletown Centre for Autism developed a programme of professional support for the staff in this new special school. </p><p>This programme includes a period of intensive upskilling before the students commence school which has been delivered to the staff of Danu Special School. </p><p>This will be followed by ongoing mentoring, coaching and in-school support during throughout the school year.</p><p>The NCSE and National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) have committed to ensuring that provision is in place to support the new school throughout the school year.</p><p>NEPS psychologists take a holistic, developmental perspective which considers the broad context of the needs of the student.  NEPS has increased the time allocation for the psychologist assigned to Danu community special school to a level which is three times that which is normally afforded to a special school of a similar size.  Furthermore, the NEPS psychologist assigned to the school has a background in ASD and additional training in behavioural support.  The purpose of this increased level of support is intended to allow for a response to the initial need for individual casework and for systems level approaches to support the teachers in behaviour management, development and ongoing monitoring, and review of Student Support Plans and facilitating effective transition processes into the school.This work will take cognisance of and coordinate with support to be provided by the NCSE Support Services and any services available via the HSE. </p><p>In addition to the specific school based service, Danu is a school within the broad NEPS Dublin Region.  It will be offered opportunities to participate in NEPS regional support and development initiatives within the region.</p><p>The NCSE Regional Team will work with the teachers and school with the overall aim of building teacher and school confidence and capacity to work with the children in their care. Training and professional development are a key part of this role.  </p><p>NCSE Advisers will be available to provide professional help support and advice on an ongoing basis. </p><p>In addition, the NCSE will appoint a behavioural practitioner with a specific brief to work with DANU and other schools who are establishing special classes for students with autism.  Arrangements are being made for the appointment of the Behaviour Practitioner and it is expected that the position will be filled in late 2019. A Behavioural practitioner will have a primary qualification in at least one of following areas: teaching, nursing, psychology, social work, social care and a related post graduate qualification in the area of Special Education or Intellectual Disability or other relevant fields. </p><p>My Department does not appoint Behavioural Specialists to schools.  Instead, my Department is building school capacity through the provision of professional support by NEPS and the advisory and professional development programmes offered by the NCSE. Schools are advised to adopt a Continuum of Support which research findings indicate is an effective support model.</p><p>Speech and Language and Occupational Therapists are normally accessed through the HSE.</p></reply>

These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school.

In such schools, faith formation and preparation for religious sacraments takes place outside of school hours. </p>  <p>  Under the Constitution and the Education Act 1998 parents have a right to have their children opt out of any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student themself.  </p>  <p>  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt-out of any class including religion is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. The precise nature of the arrangements have to be considered by each school having regards to the particular circumstances  in question including factors such as the numbers of children involved, the ages of those children and the availability of staff and physical space in the school concerned.  </p>  <p>  The Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector (2012) acknowledged that denominational religious education, including faith formation and sacramental preparation are long-established features of the primary system. With regard to denominational religious education in primary schools, the Forum&rsquo;s Report did not recommend that it be removed from the school day.  </p>  <p>  However, the Advisory Group had concerns about the amount of time which can be devoted to sacramental preparation in some schools and they recommended that it should not be allowed to encroach on time allocated for the general curriculum.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is in the process of reviewing and redeveloping the Primary School Curriculum as a whole. As part of this process the allocation of time across the curriculum will be considered, which will include the time allocated to religious education.  The NCCA will publish a draft overview of a redeveloped primary curriculum in autumn 2019. </p>  <p>  The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector also recommended that the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children have the right to receive Education about Religion and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics.  ERB and Ethics is being considered as part of the review and redevelopment of the primary curriculum, and is intended to be suitable for all children regardless of their religious beliefs.  </p>  <p>  At post-primary level, the Religious Education curriculum designed by the NCCA is an optional examinable subject at Junior and Leaving Certificate. Schools are not required to include the NCCA-developed Religious Education syllabuses at Junior or Senior Cycle as mandatory subjects on their curriculum</p></reply>

It encouraged him to continue to engage with GSOC in order to progress the investigation of his complaint. </p>  <p>  For the sake of clarity,  I want to clearly state that the request for a section 109 inquiry did not result in a discontinuation of the GSOC investigation.

An inquiry under section 109 requires the Chief Justice to request a Judge of a Superior Court to conduct the inquiry.

The WEF Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) combines 103 indicators derived from both qualitative surveys and quantitative data to assess the drivers of productivity and long-term prosperity. The findings of the report serve as a critical reminder of the importance of competitiveness in laying the foundation for future prosperity.</p>  <p>  In the 2019 Global Competitiveness Index, Ireland is ranked 24th out of 141 countries. Over the 10-year period since 2010, Ireland&rsquo;s overall ranking has ranged from 29th (2010) to 23rd (2018). Ireland&rsquo;s 2019 score means that it is currently the 9th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 12th most competitive economy in the EU28, according to the WEF.</p>  <p>  Rankings can be useful, but they must be treated with caution, especially when examining year-on-year changes. The WEF&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Rankings is one of a number of international competitiveness indicators that my Department uses to assess Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance. Although Ireland&rsquo;s ranking fell by one place in the 2019 WEF Competitiveness Rankings, Ireland is ranked 7th in the 2019 IMD World Competitiveness Rankings which measures the performance of countries across four dimensions: Economic Performance; Government Efficiency; Business Efficiency; and Infrastructure. Moreover, 30% of the WEF&rsquo;s GCI score is derived from survey-based indicators which are subjective in nature, calculated using the WEF annual Executive Opinion Survey. </p>  <p>  International rankings should be understood in the much wider context of competitiveness. To assess Ireland&rsquo;s overall performance, my department looks at several aspects of competitiveness indicators, including those in the National Competitiveness Council's (NCC) annual Cost of Doing Business report, the NCC&rsquo;s Competitiveness Scorecard, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator, the CSO&rsquo;s nominal unit labour cost indicator, in addition to Ireland&rsquo;s performance in other competitiveness indicators. On this basis, the NCC has concluded that Ireland remains a competitive economy.</p>  <p>  Competitiveness rankings reflect the interaction of a range of factors that, combined, determine the ability of firms to compete successfully in international markets. Advanced economies, such as Ireland, at the upper end of competitiveness rankings, can find it harder to get high impact from the improvements being made as they are already near the top score. Nonetheless, enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness by investing in areas where deficiencies have been identified is crucial to bolster our resilience to shocks, especially in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  Improving our competitiveness and ensuring that Ireland is an attractive location to do business remains a key economic priority for this Government. We continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness and analyse its underlying factors. The NCC will issue recommendations in its forthcoming 2019 Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge report in this regard.</p>  <p>  My officials will establish the actions we can take to further improve our competitiveness, particularly in the areas where we are lagging competitors. </p></reply>

That is why my Department and its Agencies have been doing everything we can to increase the level of employment and investment in every county in Ireland. This has included placing a particular emphasis on boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) in regional areas. </p>  <p>  In 2018, Monaghan experienced an 8% increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) employment, with 12 jobs added by companies in the County. Similarly, Meath saw a 4.5% increase, with the creation of 67 new jobs. While there were no new FDI-supported jobs created in Cavan in 2018, it is encouraging to note last week's announcement by Liberty Insurance that it will create 120 new roles in the County over the next three years. That expansion is a great vote of confidence in what Cavan and the wider Border region has to offer to multinationals.</p>  <p>  With regard to site visits in 2019, data is only yet available for the first six months of this year. Counties Meath and Monaghan each hosted two site visits over that period. County Cavan hosted four site visits over those six months. While the IDA will continue to promote and showcase locations in these Counties to prospective investors, it is important to remember that the decision as to where to invest is always taken by the companies themselves. </p>  <p>  My Department and the IDA have taken a number of steps to attract further investment to these Counties. As part of Budget 2019, for example, I allocated an additional &euro;10 million for the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme (RPP). This includes plans for an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU) at Knockaconny, County Monaghan. I announced the appointment of a design and delivery team for this ATU earlier in 2019 with construction due to commence later this year. These facilities can help to encourage overseas investors to consider regional areas and I am confident that the ATU in Knockaconny, once complete, will lead to further investment and job creation. </p>  <p>  In addition to the RPP, the IDA targets further investment for the wider area through its office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. The Agency has also appointed a new Regional Business Development Manager for the North-East Region. As part of its strategy to promote the area, the IDA is focusing on specific sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The Agency's staff regularly engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. County Meath, meanwhile, is being actively marketed by the IDA as a location for second sites for multinationals in the Dublin region, with a focus on building clusters in existing sectors like high-value manufacturing and international services.</p>  <p>In addition to the work of the IDA, my Department&rsquo;s &euro;60 million Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) has supported five projects within the Meath, Cavan and Monaghan area, with a total investment of &euro;8.2 million. These include: the Boyne Valley Food Innovation District in Meath; a food centre of excellence in Ballybay; a networked digital and innovation hub in Cavan (with others located in Leitrim and Longford); an engineering business network across the North East region; and an investment of &euro;4.9 million in a nationally significant bioeconomy innovation centre located in Monaghan.</p></reply>

The Department of Health is committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals, including Model 3 hospitals such as Cavan Hospital, with the expansion of services delivered in these hospitals, especially in services such as day surgery; ambulatory care; medical services and diagnostics. </p>  <p>  Future investment in Cavan General Hospital will be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the hospital groups and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 provides &euro;10.9 billion for Health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care. Health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue.

As you are aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy contain commitments to expanding the role of community pharmacy in managing patient health in the community.</p>  <p>  Work has been done in recent years on wider healthcare roles for pharmacies, including the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland&rsquo;s Future Pharmacy report, on the expansion of professional pharmacy practice. It is clear from this and other work that there is potential to increase the range of both private and publicly funded health services delivered through community pharmacy. Important new services, such as influenza vaccination and emergency contraception, have already been introduced.</p>  <p>  To be funded by the taxpayer, new public health services in community pharmacy, as elsewhere, should improve health outcomes and provide value for money and benefits for patients. Any new or transferred services should be based on sound evidence, with matching improvements in governance and administration.</p>  <p>  I recently met with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) when these and other issues were discussed. My officials will be engaging with the IPU on new fee regulations before the end of the year and the intention is to broaden the discussions to contractual and service arrangements during 2020.</p></reply>

The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme is working closely with clinical genetics and cancer genetics services in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and St James&rsquo;s Hospital to develop the services to meet the growing need.  Under the strategy, investments have been made in genetic counsellor, consultant and support positions, as well as cancer genetic testing.</p>  <p>  The demand for genetic assessment and testing is growing rapidly, due primarily to an increased awareness among the public and among health care professionals.  A HSE Genetics and Genomics Programme is planned, with whom the National Cancer Control Programme will work closely to ensure the sustainable development of clinical and laboratory genetics and genomics services in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Many rare diseases are genetic in origin and, as such, effective genetic services can have an important role to play in relation to diagnosis. The medical genetics service in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin provides services for patients and families affected by, or at risk of, a genetic disorder.  It comprises three integrated units: a clinical genetics service; a cytogenetics laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory. </p>  <p>  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin provided additional resources last year to support the hospital&rsquo;s Department of Clinical Genetics.

The Pharmacy Act 2007 (No. 20 of 2007) and the Regulation of Retail Pharmacy Businesses Regulations 2008 (S.I.

The guidance covers the requirements set out above and, in addition, contains further restrictions which apply to the supply of codeine-based products.</p><p>These restrictions include a requirement that codeine-based products are not available to the public for self-selection and should only be supplied when a pharmacist deems such a supply to be necessary and only when a non-opioid analgesic, e.g. paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen, has not proven sufficient to relieve the patient's sysptoms. The guidance also states that codeine medicines should be used for the shortest time possible and for no longer than three days without medical supervision. Pharmacists must ensure that patients are advised of the importance of adhering to the recommended dosage and duration of use as well as the risks associated with overdose and or/prolonged use. Patients should also be counselled in respect of potential adverse reactions or side effects. </p><p>The full guidance document, along with information on current legislative requirements, is available on the PSI website: </p><p> </p></reply>

If the forest has been impacted by biotic and abiotic factors, it may struggle to grow as well as a forest that has not been subject to pest or disease outbreaks. Each individual forest is, therefore, different in terms of the amount of carbon it can capture and only ground verification of a mature forest can give an accurate figure of carbon capture. </p>  <p>  The most recent National Forest Inventory estimates that Ireland's forests have removed (sequestered) on average 3.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year (approximately 5 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year) from the atmosphere over the period 2007 to 2016 based on a total national forest estate of 770,020 ha.  This is an average figure and takes into account all different types of tree species and ages growing on a range of different soil types. </p>  <p>  In addition, the rate of sequestration changes over time as a forest develops and matures. The Department has funded a number of large scale research projects which have examined carbon stocks and stock changes in Irish forests. For example, the carbon stocks in a Sitka spruce forest and an ash forest at different ages have been measured and are available in published journal articles. This work found that, after forty-seven years, an ash forest has 177.8 and Sitka spruce forest 376.7 tonnes of carbon per hectare. However, these figures are specific to the forests and soils examined and should not be used to reflect all forests of these species.</p></reply>

The Government's Contingency Action Plan update published in July 2019 highlights the intensive work which has taken place across Government, including by the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine.</p><p>I have introduced a number of supports to assist the agriculture sector in preparing to address the challenges posed by Brexit.  These include: </p><p>- the &euro;150 million Low-Cost Loan Scheme;</p><p>- the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme;</p><p>- the &euro;300 million Future Growth Loan Scheme; and  </p><p>- the &euro;100 million Beef Exceptional Aid Measure.</p><p>In addition to the above supports, I have introduced a range of other measures over the last number budgets to assist the agri-food sector in preparing to address the challenges posed by Brexit.  These include: </p><p>- Direct aid to farmers;</p><p>- Capital funding for the food industry;</p><p>- Supports for Bord Bia and Teagasc to assist food companies prepare for Brexit including through market diversification and innovation.</p><p>I have led an intensified series of trade missions to develop and grow new markets to increase the sector's global footprint across the world, and to reduce our dependence on the UK market.  I have appointed Attaches throughout the globe to further develop and deepen market access.</p><p>In Budget 2020, the Government announced that it will provide a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; contingency fund to support our most vulnerable sectors, with up to &euro;650 million available overall, to be activated in tranches as the full impacts of Brexit emerge.  &euro;110 million will be made available for the agri-food sector in the first tranche, to be supplemented by any exceptional aid provided by the EU.</p><p>The provision of immediate supports for our beef sector will be a first priority, as will support for our fishing fleet. We also want to support food companies to re-orient towards new products and markets, and to support other sectors to improve their competitiveness.</p><p>While supports cannot fully address the negative effects of a no-deal Brexit for the agri-food and fisheries sectors, this first tranche of supports will be used to ameliorate the immediate impact on farmers and fishermen, as the full impact of a no-deal Brexit crystallises, and to make some of the adjustments needed to improve resilience for businesses in the face of new market realities.</p></reply>

This is particularly relevant in larger conurbations. The report in question indicated that areas around certain heavily trafficked roads in the Dublin area may have higher levels of air pollution than previously indicated. These higher levels are due primarily to traffic and some locations are at risk of exceeding the statutory EU limit for the pollutant Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2).</p>  <p>  People with asthma, as well as children and the elderly are generally at greater risk for the health effects of NO2. Because of these health effects, NO2 is a controlled pollutant under the Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive, (2008/50/EC), which sets limits on NO2 levels in the ambient air. An annual average limit value of 40 micrograms per cubic metre is in place to protect against the health effects of long term exposure, and an hourly limit value of 200 micrograms per cubic metre protects against acute exposure.</p>  <p>  In the event of an exceedance of these limits, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011 provide that the relevant local authority or authorities shall prepare a clear, comprehensible and accessible air quality plan, or review and revise an existing plan, to ensure compliance with the limit value or values within the time limit specified for the relevant pollutant or pollutants. Such an air quality plan must be submitted within two years of the end of the year in which the exceedance was observed.</p>  <p>  The report also underlines the need to implement the Climate Action Plan, which was published in June this year. The Plan includes a number of actions which will have a significant impact on reducing emissions and improving air quality, including:</p>  <p>  - Putting 180,000 electric vehicles on our roads by 2025 and almost 1m by 2030</p>  <p>  - Ensuring the EV charging network underpins public confidence</p>  <p>  - Creating an early public procurement framework for EVs</p>  <p>  - Accelerating steps to decarbonise the public transport fleet</p>  <p>  - Establishing a Cycling Project Office, develop a 5 year cycling strategy and roll out 200km of new cycle lanes through bus connects</p>  <p>  - Developing a new Park and Ride Strategy, to reduce congestion and lower journey times</p>  <p>  - Developing a regulatory framework on low emission zones and parking pricing policies, and provide local authorities with the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or a town to zero emission vehicles only</p>  <p>  - Legislating for no new fossil fuel vehicles to be sold from 2030</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are establishing a working group, bringing relevant organisations together to ensure early action is taken to improve the air quality in Dublin. This process will include the two Departments, the four Dublin Local Authorities, the EPA ,and other relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  This work will complement the work already underway in developing an all of government Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national priorities, EU and other international policy considerations. The Clean Air Strategy will address a range of harmful air pollutants in Ireland, including those arising from the agricultural, transport and residential heating sectors, in an integrated manner. I intend to publish the Strategy in the coming months.</p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel that they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator. </p>  <p>  Since its inception in July 2016, the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, has been a driving force for improving access to telecommunication services throughout Ireland. The Taskforce has addressed over 70 targeted actions and worked to alleviate connectivity barriers, and continues to focus on issues that are negatively impacting upon the rollout of essential telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas, including in County Donegal. </p>  <p>  Various measures to address mobile coverage deficits, particularly in rural areas include:</p>  <p>  - Work undertaken by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development to achieve a greater consensus on site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - A report published on my Department&rsquo;s website in August 2018 based on the work of a focus group established to provide guidance on the categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority, to influence mobile operators in their work to reduce blackspots.</p>  <p>  - A working group investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly owned assets for deploying telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - A composite national outdoor coverage map published by ComReg, together with the Regulator&rsquo;s work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allowing people across Ireland to optimise services available to them. </p>  <p>  - A licensing exemption scheme developed by ComReg to enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises for immediate coverage improvement. </p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in areas currently experiencing a low level of service, including county Donegal.</p>  <p>  With respect to the quality of mobile telephony service in other countries, comparisons between Member States and within regions can be problematic for many reasons, including the fact that the technical characteristics of mobile phone networks that determine coverage and capacity will vary between operators and locations. Other factors would include the characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc.</p></reply>

The Plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </p>  <p>  Under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC (ESD), which put in place binding annual emissions targets for each year between 2013 and 2020 for sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading System, Ireland must achieve a reduction of 20% relative to 2005 levels of emissions. Under the latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published earlier this year by the EPA, emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could remain between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>  <p>  The ESD allows Member States to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. Ireland has already acquired a portion of the additional allowances that will be required for compliance. However, I am advised that Ireland will need to purchase additional allowances to meet projected shortfalls in 2019 and 2020. My Department currently estimates the cost of this requirement to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required. The EPA will release provisional greenhouse gas emission inventory data for 2018 on 23 October 2019 and this will further inform the likely purchasing requirement.</p>  <p>  As a successor to the ESD, the EU Effort Sharing Regulation (2018/842) has set binding annual emissions targets for the non-ETS sectors of each Member State for each year between 2021 and 2030. For the year 2030 itself, Ireland must achieve a reduction of 30% relative to 2005 levels of emissions.</p></reply>

Parts of Clonfert Co. Kildare are in the Blue area where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  Information on categories of specific premises can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.broadband.gov.ie, by entering the relevant Eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map. </p>  <p>  The State intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. </p>  <p>  Since the Government decision in May 2019 to appoint NBI as the Preferred Bidder for the National Broadband Plan contract, work has continued on the due diligence necessary to conclude the contract. This process is progressing towards contract award, which is expected before the end of the year. The network deployment will commence shortly after that. </p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the network rollout will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment. A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  In parallel to the work of finalising the contract, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report, which was published recently. I will bring my deliberations of the report to Government in due course.</p>  <p>  My Department has also recently undertaken a mapping consultation to ensure that the State Intervention Area is up to date and reflects operators&rsquo; plans and the responses from householders and businesses with the outcome of this consultation informing the State Aid notification to the European Commission in relation to the NBP.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that AIM - the Access and Inclusion Model - provides both universal and targeted supports for the meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE pre-school programme. AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the preschool service. It offers tailored, practical supports based on need and does not require a formal diagnosis.</p>  <p>  The third year of AIM's operation has just ended, and work on a 3-year evaluation of AIM has begun. The Government made a commitment in First 5 to consider enhancements to, or extension of, AIM to other groups of children. Such an extension might involve younger children (such as under-3s) or children attending school-age childcare services, or it might involve children with additional needs other than a disability. However, any decisions on extension or reform of AIM will depend on the findings of the 3-year evaluation, other relevant developments, and the securing of necessary resources.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that on 21st May I launched a public consultation on the future regulation and quality standards for school-age childcare, and this consultation ended on the 5th of July. The consultation included an open call for submissions, an online survey, a focus group session with school-age service providers, and an Open Policy Debate with a wide range of stakeholders. The consultation has provided rich information for consideration by my Department, and the findings may provide additional input into consideration of future supports for accessing school-age childcare.  A comprehensive report of the findings from the public consultation is currently being compiled. </p></reply>

In performing its regulatory function, its actions include responding to breaches of regulations while respecting fair procedures and natural justice. </p>  <p>  Tusla has provided my Department with the following information. The Early Years Inspectorate conducted an inspection of the service in question - which catered for both pre-school and school-age children - in line with the requirements of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 on 19 June 2019. During this inspection it was observed that the service, which was approved for a specific number of children, was operating outside its registration status, with a substantial number of additional children observed in attendance. Tusla advised the service to revert immediately to its approved registration status, and to take immediate remedial action to address the risk posed to children on the premises due to inadequate insurance. Tusla also referred the service to the local Chief Fire Officer and to the Planning and Enforcement Section of the local Council. </p>  <p>  Tusla carried out a follow-up inspection of the service in September 2019, and found that more than the approved number of children were attending the service. Tusla again instructed the service to revert to its approved registration status.  </p>  <p>  Tusla also received an application from the registered provider for registration of a school-age service which highlighted that the service has been operating in contravention of its planning permission, which states that the number of children to be accommodated at the facility must not exceed a set number.  This has resulted in the regrettable situation described. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the independent statutory regulator, carried out some 2,513 inspections in 2018. As per standard procedure, if this case had proceeded to a deregistration notice then Tusla would have informed the Department at that point. In such cases, that information then triggers suspension by the Department of funding, and referral to the local City/County Childcare Committee to work with parents and local services to help accommodate children who may lose their place in the service. This situation did not arise in this case.</p>  <p>  Tusla continues to engage with the registered provider to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible. </p></reply>

In 2017, a nationwide re-cast RAPID programme was launched.  All areas of the country were eligible for funding, and the funding was administered by Local Community Development Committees. </p>  <p>  In early 2018, my Department completed a review of the re-cast RAPID programme and the Community Facilities Scheme (CFS).  On foot of this review, I launched the new Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) in May 2018.  It  replaces and builds on RAPID and the CFS.  Combining these schemes makes for a more flexible, streamlined and targeted approach to providing funding to those communities most in need, while reducing the level of administration involved.</p>  <p>  I allocated &euro;4.5 million (of capital funding) nationally to the CEP in 2019, with &euro;212,306 allocated to the Dublin City Council area.  Funding for the 2020 CEP will be finalised through the Revised Estimates process later this year. The amount to be provided to the Dublin City Council area will then be decided prior to the launch of the 2020 programme.</p>  <p>  Separately, my Department allocated &euro;6.5 million in 2019 to the Dublin North East Inner City area towards the implementation of recommendations in the Mulvey Report, supporting the social and economic regeneration of an area at the heart of our capital city.  Again, funding for 2020 will be finalised through the Revised Estimates process later this year.</p></reply>

Illness Benefit is a payment made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness and who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions.  To qualify for Illness Benefit a person must be unable to work due to illness, under the pensionable age and satisfy contribution conditions.</p><p>2. Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and is not means tested.  To qualify for award of Invalidity Pension a claimant must satisfy both PRSI contribution and medical conditions.</p><p>Subject to certain conditions persons in receipt of IB and IP may apply for Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB).  IB and IP are the only primary income support payments from which a person may request to move to a PCB payment.</p><p>The PCB scheme seeks to extend the welfare system by responding to individual situations where a person in receipt of IB or IP retains some capacity for, and wishes to, undertake some work in the open labour market, while also continuing to require income support from the State.  The objective of the scheme is therefore to support such persons to return to the workplace without fear of the loss of their income support.  The level of income support provided where a person moves on to PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction, regarding their capacity for work.</p><p>It is important to note in relation to PCB that:</p><p>- participation is voluntary.</p><p>- a person who participates on the PCB scheme may return to an Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment if, for example, the employment ceases or if the person cannot continue to work.</p><p>- a person on the PCB scheme, with an underlying entitlement to Invalidity Pension, will retain their Free Travel Pass for a period of five years.</p><p>- there is no requirement that a person must undertake work that is of a &lsquo;rehabilitative or therapeutic&rsquo; nature.</p><p>- there is no restriction on the number of hours worked. </p><p>- there is no restriction on earnings.</p><p>PCB has therefore been designed to support persons in receipt of IB or IP to return to work while also continuing to provide them with income support through the social welfare system.  PCB is not designed to provide income support while a person is undertaking an education or training course.  People in receipt of IB and IP (subject to some conditionality) may be permitted to undertake/participate on training or educational programmes; however, they must seek prior written approval from the Department before commencing any such programme.  In addition, (also subject to some conditionality), persons in receipt of IB and IP are eligible for back to education allowance (BTEA).</p><p>Courses available through the springboard initiative are open to persons in employment, persons who are unemployed and &lsquo;returners&rsquo;.  The springboard initiative is delivered by the HEA (see <i></i>) with eligibility for the courses determined by the HEA and the individual universities and other providers delivering the courses available under the initiative.  Persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a related payment, and subject to some conditionality (for example &ndash; a person who is unemployed must be in receipt of a payment for nine of the previous 12 months if they wish to participate on the one-year full-time ICT Skills Conversion courses), can access all springboard courses.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This enables the separation of Front Office customer facing functions and Back Office processing of claims and decision making which can now be undertaken via a back office that can utilise resources from across the country.</p>  <p>  The new operating model was successfully piloted in late 2017 and early 2018 and the model has been approved for national implementation. It has now been implemented across the Department's Branch Office network and in eight Intreo Centres with rollout across the remainder of the Intreo network planned to complete in mid 2020. </p>  <p>  There has been full and ongoing consultation with staff and unions in the development,</p>  <p>  piloting and implementation of the new model.

Commercial Rates, at approximately &euro;1.5bn per annum, make up roughly a third of local government current (revenue) income. </p>  <p>  Recognising the critical importance of commercial rates I prioritised the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 and it was enacted earlier this year. The Act modernises the rates system for both ratepayers and local authorities.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are required by legislation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  </p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The ARV is then applied to each property&rsquo;s valuation to obtain the amount payable in rates. </p>  <p>  The independent Commissioner for Valuation is currently conducting a national programme of revaluation to provide consistent, up-to-date valuations so that rates are equitably distributed. Revaluation results in a redistribution of the commercial rates liability between ratepayers. While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the local authority. It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the commercial rates collected. </p>  <p>  After a revaluation of a local authority area the Minister is required to make a Rates Limitation Order (RLO) to ensure that the overall rates collected in that area for the following year, does not increase beyond normal inflation and buoyancy to take account of new valuations.  RLOs have been made for each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and will be made in the coming weeks in respect of the eight local authorities where revaluations have concluded this year.</p>  <p>  To date, revaluations have been fully completed in 16 local authorities, a further eight were completed in 2019 and the final tranche should be completed by 2021. At all stages of the process, ratepayers are consulted and informed and can bring relevant information to bear on the valuation. Ultimately ratepayers have a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal. In terms of revaluations to date, I understand that the trend is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have experienced a decrease.</p>  <p>  Local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulties with the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities may facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options. The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 will further facilitate such flexible approaches, provided ratepayers engage with the local authority concerned. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the Act also provides for new rates vacancy abatement and rates alleviation schemes, to be decided by local authority members in order to promote national and/or local policy objectives.  My Department is currently preparing supporting regulations and working with local authorities on implementation with a view to commencing these provisions.  These new provisions will add to the suite of options already available to local authorities to support local businesses and ratepayers.</p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016 and provides for the sale of existing local authority houses only. The 2015 Regulations governing the Scheme provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living. The exclusion of these property types ensures the continued availability within the social housing stock of properties that are in short supply. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p></reply>

On a like-for-like basis local authorities will be in receipt of &euro;23 million more in funding in 2020 when compared to 2019. The extra &euro;23 million represents an increase of 27% in exchequer support for local authorities to meet additional pay and pension costs arising from national pay agreements.</p>  <p>  While there is a headline reduction on the 2019 budget allocation of &euro;185m, this is due to a reduction in the exchequer supports required by local authorities in 2020. The realignment of support for Local Government in 2020 is largely as a result of the valuation of Irish Water as a global utility liable for commercial rates from 2020. As a consequence of this, there is no longer a requirement for general water rates compensation in 2020. The Department is actively monitoring the financial impact of this transition on individual local authorities in the context of their overall financial position.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the LGF will make Local Property Tax (LPT) allocations of &euro;516.8m in 2020 (up from &euro;503m in 2019). The increase in LPT allocations is accounted for, in the most part, by the decisions of 19 local authorities to increase their LPT rates above the basic rate for 2020. </p></reply>

The Expert Panel has made recommendations to my Department on the suitability of schemes and projects for funding based on objective criteria which are set out in the framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals. </p>  <p>  Earlier this week, on 14 October, and based on the recommendations of the Expert Panel I announced approval of projects and schemes under the multi-annual programme. Local authorities were informed of the details on the same date.</p>  <p>  Work is also at an advanced stage of development for 2 new schemes to replace existing schemes which assist householders, in certain circumstances, in the provision of on-site domestic water supplies and waste water treatment systems. I expect that the process will be completed shortly when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place. This will enable a circular letter, terms and conditions, guidance and the application form to issue to local authorities shortly thereafter. </p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The ARV is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates.</p>  <p>  Local authorities also work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulties with the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities may facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019, enacted earlier this year, modernises the legislation governing commercial rates.  The Act will further facilitate such flexible approaches, provided ratepayers engage with the local authority concerned. Importantly, the act also provides for new rates vacancy abatement and rates alleviation schemes, to be decided by local authority members in order to promote national and/or local policy objectives.  My Department is currently preparing supporting regulations and working with local authorities on implementation with a view to commencing these provisions.  These new provisions will add to the suite of options already available to local authorities to support local businesses and ratepayers.</p></reply>

This has included the establishment of the Peatlands Council, intensive and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters.</p>  <p>  The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme was established in 2011 for active turf cutters arising from the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation and was extended in 2014 to include natural heritage areas. It is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with a once-off legal agreement payment of &euro;500. </p>  <p>  While applicants are waiting for relocation sites to be investigated, prepared and developed, they may, on an interim basis, opt for the annual payment or opt to receive an annual supply of up to 15 tonnes of cut turf delivered to their homes. </p>  <p>   From 2012 to date, 18,506 annual payments and 1,150 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of applications received under the scheme for raised bog special areas of conservation at a cost of just under &euro;29.4m. In addition, 1,837 once-off legal agreement payments have been made costing &euro;938,500. </p>  <p>  Resulting from a recommendation of the report of the Peatlands Forum held in 2012, the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022 was approved by the Government and published in 2017.  The Plan sets out a framework for the conservation, management and restoration of the raised bog network whilst addressing the needs of turf cutters and other stakeholders. The cost of the development of the National Management Plan (including scientific studies on the conservation and restoration of the raised bogs), the National Peatlands Strategy 2015 and the 2014 review of the Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network was approximately &euro;1.923m.</p>  <p>  Operational costs for the Peatlands Council to date stand at &euro;0.040m.</p>  <p>  The framework for the restoration programme for Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation is contained within the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022. Work on the restoration programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4m project &lsquo;The Living Bog&rsquo; which is co-funded under the EU LIFE 2014-2020 programme. The Department is managing this project and is contributing &euro;1.352m as well as expert ecological resources and know-how, with the European Commission providing &euro;4.056m. </p>  <p>  In tandem with the LIFE project, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department is undertaking restoration works on State owned lands within the protected raised bog network. Costs to date for these works, including project management of the works, is &euro;0.542m.  </p>  <p>  I was pleased to recently announce that &euro;7m is being provided in the budget for 2020 for the restoration and conservation of peatlands.</p></reply>

So far, of the 26 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, 16 plans have been approved to date.

Unfortunately, in the absence of a North-South Ministerial Council, it has not been possible to allocate additional monies to this programme in 2020.  That said, my Department makes every effort, where possible, to allocate funding direct to Foras na Gaeilge's lead organisations to support the services they provide to Irish-speaking communities.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has been framed in the context of an imminent Brexit.

This has included the establishment of the Peatlands Council, intensive and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters. The aim is to address the needs of turf cutters as part of an overall raised bog designated sites network solution, as set out in the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022. This involves a balance of protecting traditional rights, providing compensation where these rights are curtailed, and seeking to facilitate feasible alternatives, where possible, while working to ensure that Ireland meets its legal obligations.</p>  <p>  In the region of 2,000 applicants have qualified for payment under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme from 48 of the 53 raised bog special area of conservation sites. There are particular reasons as to there being no qualifying applicants under the scheme for the remaining 5 sites, for example, the lack of turf cutting on these sites during the qualifying period. </p>  <p>  For 11 raised bog special areas of conservation, relocation sites within non-designated bogs have been identified and developed. Some of these relocation sites have been operational since 2013/14 with domestic turf cutting scheduled to begin in the 2020 season in the most recently developed sites. Relocation sites for a further 8 special areas of conservation have been identified by the Department and are at various stages of development. The Department is still investigating suitable relocation sites for 7 raised bog special areas of conservation.</p>  <p>  For a number of the special area of conservation sites, the non-designated site identified may not be suitable or may not have the capacity to cater for the number of turf cutters who may wish to relocate there. In such cases and within the framework of the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, the Department, in consultation with turf cutter representatives, is considering the available options in terms of relocation and the provisions of the Habitats Directive to provide for turf cutting with certain areas of the raised bog special areas of conservation. 14 sites are under consideration for the possible application of article 6 of the Directive.</p></reply>
