Counsious of the risk of poverty those fleeing Domestic Violence face, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to investigate the provision of paid leave and social protection provision to victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  The issue of domestic violence leave has been researched by officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. This research has included consideration of domestic violence leave at international level, identifying best practice and developing a suitable model for roll-out in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department has engaged in a targeted consultation process with relevant stakeholders and social partners to examine how a scheme of leave should operate to address the needs of victims most effectively. This has included consulting with the monitoring committee of the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, employers' groups and trade unions. Stakeholders of the National Equality Strategy Committees have also been consulted.</p>  <p>  I have met with a number of employer representative bodies in relation to the domestic violence leave, as well as the upcoming Work Life Balance Bill, including IBEC, Chambers Ireland and ICTU. Some of the issues that have arrisen with the groups has been the need for support for employers implementing such leave, as well as the need for flexibility in terms of people taking up the leave, and the documentation that would be required to support and application for domestic violence leave. </p>  <p>  A report is being prepared based on this work, which will be brought to Government shortly. The report will include recommendations on how best to support employees experiencing domestic abuse, including proposals for the introduction of domestic violence leave. I intend to progress this leave as part of the Work Life Balance Bill. </p></reply>

One that is affordable for parents, provides quality care and education to children, and pays staff well. </p>  <p>  We all recognise that childcare fees should not be a burden. We want every parent to be able to access childcare without worrying about what it will cost. That's why I am moving forward with far-ranging reforms in the Early Years sector, informed by the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model that will see much greater State management of the sector, whilst delivering cost reductions for parents. </p>  <p>  Core Funding marks a new departure in State funding of the sector in order to deliver early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families, and sustainability and a stable income for services. </p>  <p>  Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;221 million in a full year. It will require a commitment not to increase fees from September 2021 rates. This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  This is particularly important because from September 2022, universal NCS subsidies will be extended to children of all ages up to 15. </p>  <p>  A Transition Fund is now available to providers between May until August ahead of the introduction of Core Funding. The Transition Fund invests in services, subject to their agreement not to increase parents' fees from September 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that, so far, 92% of services have signed up for the Transition Fund and the associated fee control.</p>  <p>  I hope to see a similarly high take up rate for Core Funding, to allow the maximum number of parents to benefit from continued fee control and existing and new investment in the NCS and ECCE Programme. </p>  <p>  As mentioned, the reforms I am implementing will for the first time provide Government with the means to meaningfully reduce the cost of early learning and childcare for parents. With these reforms in place, preparations are now underway in my Department to seek significant investment into the National Childcare Scheme in the context of the forthcoming budget that will lead to a substantial reduction in fees for parents without adversely affecting the sustainability and availability of services. </p></reply>

The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain charitable organisations.</p><p>In response to recent concerns raised around access to the scheme and the relevant qualifying criteria,  my colleague, Minister of Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D committed to undertaking a comprehensive review of the scheme.</p><p>Following engagement with Minister Donohoe last year, it was decided to use the Transport Working Group, which was established in 2020 to advance Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to assist with the review of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme. However, actual legislative and budgetary responsibility for the Scheme continues to lie with the Department of Finance, which will be able to address granular queries in relation to the Scheme.</p><p>The objective of the Transport Working Group is to coordinate action on transport provision for people with disabilities across Government. Action 104 of the NDIS commits that a review will be conducted of existing transport schemes, and a coordinated plan will be developed to enhance the options for transport to work or employment for people with disabilities.</p><p>The Transport Working Group met at the end of January, chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State for Disability, Anne Rabbitte T.D.. The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme was discussed at this meeting. The work of the Transport Group was also discussed at the April meeting of the Steering Group for the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.</p><p>The current focus of the Group's work is on scoping the provision of transport supports across government departments and public bodies, with a view to assessing gaps or anomalies in provision.</p><p>Further meetings of the Transport Working Group will be scheduled shortly. </p></reply>

The package of measures I announced in Budget 2022 is designed to ensure that fees to parents do not increase and that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme are felt without being absorbed in fee increases.</p>  <p>  The Transition Fund starts this process and will be in place between May and August 2022. This is a temporary, once-off scheme, to support providers transition from the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) to the new Core Funding Scheme in September.</p>  <p>  The main contractual requirement for the Transition Fund is that fees remain at or below September 2021 levels for the period of the scheme. This requirement will apply to all services who contract into for the Transition Fund. Participation is optional but I am very pleased that approximately 93% of providers have now signed-up and thereby have agreed to maintain their fees at or below September 2021 rates.  </p>  <p>  Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;221 million in a full year. It will also require a commitment not to increase fees from September 2021 rates. This will ensure that parents feel the full benefits of investment into the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  This is particularly important because from September 2022, universal NCS subsidies will be extended to children of all ages up to 15. </p>  <p>  As part of providers coming into contract for Core Funding, detailed data on their income and costs has been required.  Analysis of this data will assist my Department to develop its approaches to fee management in future years, in line with recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good, the report of the Expert Group for a new funding model for this sector. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-02a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022060200058#WRA01900"><p>Ensuring the availability of high-quality early learning and childcare that is affordable and accessible is a key priority for me.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, significant increases in State investment in early learning and childcare has given rise to a substantial growth in the numbers of children participating in these services. Every year, more than 100,000 children participate on the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidises up to 80,000 children. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Transition Fund operating from May-August this year and the new Core Funding Scheme to roll out from September include a fee freeze condition, which will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the ECCE programme and the NCS, including the enhancements to the NCS, which I announced as part of Budget 2022.  </p>  <p>  The reforms I am implementing will for the first time provide Government with the means to meaningfully reduce the cost of early learning and childcare for parents. With these reforms in place, preparations are now underway in my Department to seek significant investment into the National Childcare Scheme in the context of the forthcoming budget that will lead to a substantial reduction in fees for parents without adversely affecting the sustainability and availability of services. </p>  <p>  I am also taking a range of steps to address issues of under supply. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, I have committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan. </p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, City/County Childcare Committees have been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need.  </p></reply>

Accommodation in a Reception and Integration Centres will be own-door for families and own-room for single people, with specific tailoring for people with identified vulnerabilities. These centres will be newly built and be operated by not-for-profit organisations on behalf of the State. </p>  <p>  Residents will remain in the centres for a maximum of four months - where they will undergo a programme of orientation, support and integration. Once the four month programme is complete, if the applicant has not received a positive first-instance decision on their application, or is undergoing an appeals process, they will transition from a Reception and Integration Centre to a house, apartment or own room in the community. This new approach will end congregated and institutional living and will focus on supporting integration from day one.</p>  <p>  In the interim, a request for tender has been issued by my Department seeking additional accommodation for applicants for international protection which enables families to be accommodated in independent living options.  This tender is a key plank in the strategy to end the current reliance on emergency accommodation. The aim is to ensure that all families in the international protection process are accommodated in independent living options once they have completed the initial reception process. The compliance check process was due to begin on 28 February but was delayed due to the Ukrainian refugee situation. However, the compliance check has now recommenced and the aim is to contract shortly any properties which meet the requirements of the tender.</p></reply>

The General Scheme of the proposed Bill, which is published on my Department's website, has been referred to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme has also been referred to the Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>  <p>  I have invited ICTU as representatives of trade unions, and Chambers Ireland, Ibec, and ISME representing employer's interests to meet with me to discuss the draft General Scheme of the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill and to hear their views on its content and potential impact. They have also been consulted as to how it can be implemented so to maximise the potential benefits for employees and mitigate any potentially negative impact on employers.

On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.    </p>  <p>  The Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 will robustly fulfill the vast majority of the report's recommendations, specifically addressing recommendations 1- 14 inclusive.  In terms of the status of this Bill, it was passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 27th April 2022 and is currently at Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann. My hope is that it will be enacted this summer, with some elements of the legislation having immediate effect and others being commenced in the autumn.    </p>  <p>  In relation to recommendation 16 regarding a payment towards legal costs associated with, for example, a declaration of parentage - I have previously signalled my intention to establish a payment scheme to make once-off payments of &euro;3,000 to the individuals affected by confirmed illegal birth registration. The development of this scheme is at an advanced stage with a view to implementation as soon as possible in 2022.   </p>  <p>  In relation to recommendation 17 that a State inquiry into illegal adoptions should be established on a non-statutory basis, this must be considered in the context of the overall Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions and, specifically, in the context of the recently announced proposals for a National Centre for Research and Remembrance. The Centre will comprise a number of distinct, yet interrelated, areas, including a museum and exhibition space, the development of which will be led by the National Museum of Ireland; and a place for reflection and remembrance.    </p>  <p>  In addition, it will contain a research centre and central repository of records related to institutional trauma in the 20th century, which will form part of the National Archives. One unique aspect of the central repository will be the intended inclusion of the personal testimonies of survivors; allowing the lived experiences of survivors- in their own words- to be formally acknowledged as part of the official record and preserved for posterity.    </p>  <p>  This important initiative, therefore, addresses the issue of access to records which is so crucial for any further analysis or inquiry, as well as fulfilling one of the key objectives of any truth commission, namely giving voice and providing official recognition to the lived experience of people affected by the legacy of these institutions and historical adoption practices. </p></reply>

This plan is informed by an assessment of need carried out prior to the young person leaving care.</p><p>The plan sets out the assistance that may be provided by Tusla to the eligible person from the age of 18.  Specifically the Act states that any assessment of need shall include an assessment by Tusla of the needs (if any) of the person being assessed in relation to: education, financing and budgeting matters, training and employment, health and wellbeing, personal and social development, accommodation and family support.</p><p>There are a number of supports available to care leavers as follows:</p><p>Tusla provides financial support to eligible care leavers who are engaged in a qualifying educational course or training programme. The &lsquo;aftercare allowance&rsquo; amounts to &euro;300 per week and is available to care leavers up to the age of 23.</p><p>In addition, care leavers may also be entitled to a number of additional financial supports in respect of education which include the SUSI Grant (which is payable at the higher rate for care leavers) and the Tusla Dormant Accounts funded Bursary Scheme.Care leavers not engaged in education and not in employment are eligible for full Jobseekers Allowance (&euro;203.00) rather than the reduced rate (&euro;112.70), provided that they were in the care of Tusla for 12 months prior to their 18<sup>th</sup>birthday.</p><p>All eligible care leavers are supported through aftercare services. Care Leavers, depending on need, may be allocated an aftercare worker, and all care leavers, without exception or age limit, can attend drop-in centres organised by the Tusla aftercare service.Eligible care leavers are also entitled to an aftercare grant. This is a once off payment paid to the eligible adult when they leave a placement and is to assist with rent/ deposit and startup costs associated with initial moving home expenses. </p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query on allocation of aftercare workers, Tusla has advised that they began to collate the metric in relation to young people/ young adults and allocation of an aftercare worker in 2018, with the introduction of the new Aftercare Policy, and accordingly the data provided does not include 2017 as requested by the Deputy.</p><p>The below table provides the number of young people in receipt of aftercare services who were assessed as needing an aftercare worker, and of these the number with/without an aftercare worker at year end for the year 2018 &ndash; 2021 and at the end Q1 2022. These are the latest figures available. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th># Assessed</th>       <th>#with Worker</th>       <th>%with worker</th>       <th># awaiting</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>1805</td>       <td>1669</td>       <td>92%</td>       <td>136</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2099</td>       <td>1889</td>       <td>90%</td>       <td>210</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2238</td>       <td>2051</td>       <td>92%</td>       <td>187</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>2203</td>       <td>2080</td>       <td>94%</td>       <td>123</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Q1 2022</td>       <td>2,351</td>       <td>2,129</td>       <td>91%</td>       <td>222</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Tusla&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2022 committed to improving the availability and quality of aftercare services for young people and includes a commitment to a 10% increase in the number of young people 18 years and over who have an allocated aftercare worker where their aftercare plan determines this as a need.</p></reply>

This survey was undertaken as part of the Action Plan put in place by my Department to respond to the early learning and childcare needs of Ukrainian children and their families. This survey was followed in May by the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal. Approximately 83% of providers have already participated.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data revealed an undersupply of early learning and childcare places for very young children.</p><p>Lower demand for early learning and childcare owing to Covid-19 gave rise to unprecedented vacancy rates &ndash; an overall vacancy rate of 21% and vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years of 20% and 10% respectively.</p><p>Preliminary analysis of the latest data captured by CCC and Pobal reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13% and the vacancy rates for children under 1 and children aged 1-2 years 14% and 6% respectively.</p><p>The network of 30 CCC across the country are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. CCC are also proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of undersupply. I have already referred to the National Development Plan and work underway to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines, both of which will also help to address issues of undersupply.</p><p>In addition, the new Core Funding Scheme, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery. This means higher levels of funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher. I am hopefully this new approach to funding will encourage services to operate baby and toddler rooms, where demand exists.  </p></reply>

Article 9 of the UNCRPD requires signatories to take measures to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal access to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public. </p>  <p>  In addition to the overarching obligations that flow from the UNCRPD, domestic legislation, in the form of the Disability Act 2005, obliges public bodies to ensure that public buildings, heritage sites, and services are accessible to people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the central importance of accessibility in creating a more inclusive society. DCEDIY is responsible for coordinating two whole-of-government strategies which aim  to support implementation of Ireland's obligations under the UNCRPD and the Disability Act 2005, including in relation to accessibility. These are the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) (2017-2022) and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (2015-2024).</p>  <p>  A number of NDIS actions specifically identify and seek to address a range of accessibility issues, including in relation to the provision of information, transport, assistive technologies, public buildings, ICT and procurement. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the NDIS is monitored via NDIS Steering Group meetings through a reporting system which requires Government Departments and Agencies to detail their progress biannually. The group is supported by independent analysis and advice from the National Disability Authority (NDA).</p>  <p>  Two working groups have also been established to address specific actions under the NDIS with important accessibility dimensions. The objective of the Action 104 Transport Working Group is to review all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities in order to work towards ensuring more accessible transport options.</p>  <p>  An ad-hoc Working Group on Assistive Technology has also been established to make progress on relevant actions related to accessibility and assistive technology. </p>  <p>  The Government's approach to accessibility is informed by developments at EU level. Ireland has taken steps to implement the EU Web Accessibility Directive, which requires all public sector websites and mobile applications to be accessible to people with disabilities. My Department is also working to transpose the European Accessibility Act, which will introduce minimum accessibility requirements for certain products and services across the EU. </p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority (NDA), which is funded and supported by my Department, plays a key role in supporting my Department in the coordination of disability policy, including in relation to accessibility. The Disability Act 2005 established a Centre for Excellence in Universal Design (CEUD) in the NDA. The CEUD is dedicated to promoting universal design, promoting the design of environments that can be accessed regardless of a person's age, size, ability or disability. The NDA is also responsible for monitoring implementation of the EU Web Accessibility Directive. The first report on implementation of the Directive was published in December 2021.</p></reply>

and</p><p>28% families were working more because of NCS, with 8% reporting that they would not be in work without it. </p><p>I recognise however that the fee burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability.</p><p>The package of measures I announced in Budget 2022 will allow further progress to be made.</p><p>Since August 2020, early learning and childcare services had been able to access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) without having to demonstrate a reduction in turnover. This continued to be available until the end of April. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years, as demonstrated in the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Report 2020/21.</p><p>Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of a new Core Funding Scheme, I put in place a Transition Fund. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. I am delighted to report that so far 93% of services have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into contract for the Transition Fund. </p><p>A central condition of the Core Funding Scheme, which will commence in September, will be that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time. </p><p>Budget 2022 also extended universal NCS subsidies for children of all ages up to 15, and changed how &lsquo;wraparound hours&rsquo; for NCS subsidies are determined. </p><p>Ensuring no fee increase, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for parents.  </p></reply>

Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here. To date, more than 32,000 people have arrived in Ireland and just in excess of 23,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.</p>  <p>  My Department has contracted approximately 17,800 beds currently in hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;Bs, hostels, self-catering accommodation and certain other repurposed settings with additional capacity also being pursued through accommodation pledged by the general public, state-owned or private properties which may be suitable for short-term accommodation, accommodation belonging to voluntary bodies, student accommodation, holiday homes, religious order properties and Local Authority facilities. </p>  <p>  Within my Department, a dedicated Ukraine Response Division has been newly established. The team includes more than 80 staff. The majority of these staff have moved from within the Department with consequent impacts on ongoing work priorities. The Division also includes new staff and those seconded from other Departments and Agencies.</p>  <p>  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging. Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation. While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation. Numbers seeking international protection have also increased adding to accommodation capacity issues.</p>  <p>  I want to recognise the hard work and commitment of Department staff in providing accommodation for so many people in such a short period, as well as maintaining work progress in other key areas. Many staff have volunteered their own time, at night and on weekends, to work in the welcome centre in Citywest to provide that immediate welcome to people fleeing Ukraine as they arrive here. The Department and its staff will continue in their efforts to assist those arriving as best they can. </p></reply>

This Strategy was developed in consultation with stakeholders, and the process included consultation with civil society and with the public. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment that the Government will develop and implement a new National Strategy for Women and Girls. I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over the term of the outgoing Strategy, and consider how we can bring forth the next iterations of the suite of national equality strategies and ensure they are even more robust and effective. In this regard, my Department has commissioned a study to evaluate the processes for implementation of three equality strategies, which includes the National Strategy for Women and Girls as well as the Migrant Integration Strategy and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy. Consultations in regard to the successor strategy will commence during 2022. In the interim, the principles and priorities of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 continue to guide my Department's work to advance gender equality and women's rights.</p>  <p>  The gender pay gap in Ireland, which was 14.4% in 2017, fell to 11.3% in 2018, the most recent year for which statistics are currently available. Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is a key commitment in the outgoing Strategy. Employers and their representative organisations have contributed to the public consultation undertaken on the matter in autumn 2017 and to the symposium that followed in January 2018. Tackling this issue contributes to equality and makes good business sense, as firms that can report a low or non-existent gender pay gap will have an advantage in recruiting and retaining employees. Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can also be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.</p>  <p>  Consultations have taken place with unions and employer representative organisations about the gender pay gap, especially in the context of the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021. The aim of the Act is to provide transparency on the gender pay gap and incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. Regulations have been made under the Act. Under these Regulations, organisations are asked to select a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; date in the month of June, and those organisations having not less than 250 employees on that date will then have six months to prepare their calculations before reporting six months later, during December. My Department has issued guidance to employers on calculating their gender pay gaps. It is also continuing to engage with trade union and employer representative bodies on the implementation of the legislation.</p></reply>

This new funding model is now beginning to be implemented to improve quality, affordability, sustainability and accessibility of services.</p>  <p>  The package of measures for the sector announced in Budget 2022 was informed by the Expert Group recommendations. The package includes a new Core Funding stream valued at up to &euro;221 million in a full year. Making early learning and childcare more affordable to parents and improving services' sustainability are central objectives of Core Funding, along with improving quality including through better terms and conditions for the workforce. </p>  <p>  A central condition of Core Funding will be that providers agree not to increase fees above those which were charged last year. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to NCS subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. The approach to fee management will be developed further over time. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also extended universal NCS subsidies for children of all ages up to 15, and changed how &lsquo;wraparound hours&rsquo; for NCS subsidies are determined. The Expert Group report also recommended increasing the NCS rates and this will also be implemented for future years.  </p>  <p>  Ensuring no fee increase, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for parents.  </p>  <p>  Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. A number of safeguards have been put in place to ensure no unintended outcomes of Core Funding including a funding guarantee and a Sustainability Fund which is open to services.</p>  <p>  In order to contribute to services' stability and sustainability, Core Funding will be allocated based largely on capacity. Higher levels of funding will be available for capacity for younger children, to support the higher operating costs for these children arising from the higher staff ratio requirements. </p>  <p>  Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance.  </p>  <p>  Since August 2020, early learning and childcare services had been able to access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) without having to demonstrate a reduction in turnover. This continued to be available until the end of April. This significant level of funding to the sector has ensured that fees have remained largely static for the last two years and that providers have continued to be sustainable.</p>  <p>  Following the tapering of EWSS and prior to the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund is available to providers. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund will be an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. I am delighted to report that so far 93% of services have agreed to operate a freeze on parental fees by coming into contract for the Transition Fund. </p>  <p>  The Fund is designed to support the stability and sustainability of services in the interim period between the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and ahead of the introduction of the new Core Funding Scheme in September 2022.</p>  <p>  As you can see, I am committed to putting in place a strong foundation to improve affordability for parents and sustainability for services, as well as improved quality of provision, including pay and conditions for the workforce. This foundation will allow for further developments in future years.</p></reply>

My Department continues to monitor the issue. </p>  <p>  According to the Annual Early Years Sector Profile, the annual staff turnover rate across the sector was 19% in 2021, which was down from 23% in 2019 but remains high. While at least 28% of these moved to another service in the sector, others left the sector.</p>  <p>  In 2021, while 57% of services reported no staff turnover, when the size of service is taken into account, as much as 70% of small services retained all their staff, compared to 39% of medium-sized services and 27% of large services.</p>  <p>  In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover, and recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to pay and conditions, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021.</p>  <p>  However, as the State does not employ early years educators or school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p>  <p>  In December last, I published Nurturing Skills, the Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022 to 2028. Actions in Nurturing Skills to develop career pathways and promote careers in the sector will complement efforts to improve pay and conditions of employment, to make the sector more attractive to potential workers.</p>  <p>  A key enabler for Nurturing Skills will be the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services. I began a process in December 2020, which examined the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee, which began meeting in December 2021. The Joint Labour Committee continues to meet.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced a new &euro;221m Core Funding stream which, among other objectives, will support service providers to meet new higher minimum rates of pay that may be negotiated through the Joint Labour Committee.</p></reply>

The Action Plan for Online Safety 2018 &ndash; 2019, which was launched by the then Taoiseach in July 2018, set out the range of actions and activities which were underway across six key Government Departments ((the then named) Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business, Enterprise and Innovation) to keep children and adults safe online. While the lifespan of this Action Plan has ended, I remain committed to working with my colleagues in a co-ordinated Government response to address issues arising.   </p>  <p>  The Children First legislation and guidance, which is under the remit of my Department, operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety, in January 2019, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs published an addendum to the Children First National Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the preparation of statutory risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements. In addition, Tusla revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.   </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to three national youth organisations that provide online safety resources for the youth sector. The National Youth Council of Ireland provides the Web Safety in Youth Work Resource, SpunOut has developed an Online Safety Hub which provides guidelines for young people on online safety and For&oacute;ige has rolled-out an online safety programme, which enables young people to engage online with safe and creative digital learning experiences.   </p>  <p>  The 2020 Programme for Government contains significant commitments relating to online safety. These relate to the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner.    </p>  <p>  The Online Safety and Media Regulation (OSMR) Bill provides for the appointment of an Online Safety Commissioner, as part of a wider Media Commission, to oversee a new regulatory framework for online safety. The Commissioner will govern this new framework through binding online safety codes and robust compliance, enforcement and sanction powers. The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media published the OSMR Bill 2022 in January 2022 and it was initiated in the Seanad later that month. The OSMR Bill sets out defined categories of harmful online content (e.g. cyberbullying material and material promoting eating disorders), a definition of &lsquo;age-inappropriate online content&rsquo; and the process by which additional categories of harmful online content may be specified.    </p>  <p>  The Online Safety Commissioner will also have a role in promoting positive digital citizenship among children and young people, in conjunction with Webwise and other educational partners, schools as well as the Ombudsman for Children. The Webwise programme, funded by the Department of Education, is a key educational resource in the promotion of online safety, providing information and advice to children and young people, teachers and parents.   </p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Education has also brought forward significant policy initiatives in this area this year including the publication of the new Digital Strategy for Schools in April, which focusses on further embedding the use of digital technologies in all teaching, learning and assessment activities and includes building awareness and knowledge around online safety. The Department of Education is also currently reviewing the Action Plan on Bullying and the Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools. The review will take account of the significant developments and relevant research since the Action Plan and Anti-Bullying Procedures were first published in 2013 and it will specifically consider cyberbullying, among other areas. My Department is represented on the Steering Committee established to carry out the review and to develop a new Action Plan.</p></reply>

Initial information about the scheme was made available as part of the Budget FAQ: at <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/b3e97-budget-2022-overview-and-faqs-for-early-learning-and-care-elc-and-school-age-childcare-sac-providers-and-parents/</i>.</p><p>This was followed in December with the publication of the report of an Expert Group, Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare. The report sets out extensive detail for the rationale for the introduction of Core Funding along with specific recommendations for implementation which have been accepted by Government.  The report is available here: <i>first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/report/</i>.</p><p>Extensive information was communicated to the sector on 7th March, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services. A Ready Reckoner was also launched to assist providers in estimating the potential value of Core Funding for their individual service, as well as to test different scenarios.  A detailed FAQ was published at this time which is available here: <i>earlyyearshive.ncs.gov.ie/how-to-guides/faqs/faq-rr/DCEDIY-FAQ-for-Ready-Reckoner.pdf</i><i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>In response to a number of queries received by my Department, officials have produced public information relating to Core Funding for the whole sector. This includes presentations and case studies to help providers understand the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their services. This information, first published on 14th April and kept up to date at <i>www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding/</i>, addresses many of the frequently asked questions around Core Funding and the New Funding Model. </p><p>City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have also received extensive briefing and training on Core Funding so they can provide support and guidance to individual services or parents with any queries relating to Core Funding.  CCCs are offering workshops and one-to-one sessions to providers to support them.</p><p>The Core Funding contract will be published in June so applicants can review what they will later be asked to sign in August. The details of the Core Funding application form will also be available in June along with a new FAQ. Payments to providers will commence at the end of August. </p><p>Core Funding is a very significant development and a new departure in how funding is administered in the sector.  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall.</p><p>The new funding model is an extensive project requiring multi-annual investment. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. </p><p>Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number of providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.</p><p>83% of services have now responded to Sector Profile survey, which is a first step in applying for the</p><p>new Core Funding scheme. 93% of providers have signed-up to the Transition Fund, which introduces fee control measures to be continued under Core Funding. I am encouraged by this high uptake and that providers have shown a real willingness and openness to work in partnership with the State towards the shared goal of delivering high quality and affordable ELC and SAC for families, for the public good. </p></reply>

These are own door apartments providing accommodation for 60 families. Own door emergency accommodation opened recently in Wicklow, with 9 families  provided with own door accommodation with more families to  move there in the coming weeks. In addition, there are currently around 400 people being accommodated in Travelodge Townsend Street, Dublin. All singles are in their own rooms there.  </p>  <p>  On the whole, across commercial and State-owned International Protection Accommodation Centres - not including emergency centres, reception centres, Emergency Reception Orientation Centres (EROCs) or centres recently taken on to accommodate Ukrainian arrivals - 81% of residents have access to independent living facilities. Residents can cook and shop for themselves, families have access to private living room spaces, and residents have access to social spaces. Added to this, 33% have access to own-door unit settings. This means that residents live in a self-contained unit such as an apartment which has a private kitchen and living space. </p>  <p>  In addition, a request for tender (RFT) has been issued by my Department early this year seeking additional accommodation for applicants for international protection which enables families to be accommodated in independent living options. This tender is a key plank in the strategy to end the current reliance on emergency accommodation. The aim is to ensure that all families in the international protection process are accommodated in independent living options once they have completed the initial reception process.  </p>  <p>  The compliance check process was due to begin on 28 February but was delayed due to the Ukrainian refugee situation. However, the compliance check has now recommenced and properties which fulfill the requirements of the tender will be contracted as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In the fourteen months since its publication my department has placed a significant focus on delivering the new model of accommodation and supports for International Protection applicants. The progress made has included:</p><p>Establishment of a dedicated transition team to drive implementation of the programme. </p><p>Development of a detailed implementation plan including inputs from other key stakeholders who have a responsibility for delivering services to International Protection applicants. </p><p>Governance structures established to oversee transition to the new model in the form of a Programme Board and an External Advisory Committee. The membership of the Programme Board includes a representative with lived experience of International Protection and representatives of non-governmental organisations. The Board has met regularly over the past twelve months to review progress. The board most recently met on the 28th April and are due to meet again on the 16th June to review project timelines in light of the Ukraine Crisis. As part of the Programme Board governance framework it has appointed a Risk Committee to oversee the management of risks. </p><p>Significant progress has been made on putting in place the new accommodation model.  This work has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy, an ownership model and a funding model. Proposals in relation to the ownership model were brought to the Programme Board in November and approved by myself in January 2022. Work is also ongoing to develop a funding model for Approved Housing Bodies to support them in building a pipeline of Phase Two accommodation. The funding model will be launched in the coming months. </p><p>The County and City Management Association has developed and approved a Local Authority allocation key. The key allows for a distribution of applicants across the country according to population criteria.  DCEDIY and the Housing Agency are using the allocation key to identify suitable properties for purchase for Phase Two accommodation. </p><p>The Housing Agency has proceeded to source a range of properties for Phase Two accommodation and has acquired an initial number to date. Work to source and acquire properties will continue for the remainder of 2022.</p><p>Work is also moving ahead on developing the system of income support that applicants will receive when moving into Phase Two accommodation. A policy paper has been developed and work is now proceeding to design the operational structures for the payment. </p><p>The Transition Team is also developing an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out in the White Paper. In collaboration with the Local Authorities there has been a focus on designing the supports that will be required at a local level. The proposal is to expand the current model of interagency working groups and resettlement and intercultural workers that is in place for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  The aim is to establish a permanent integration system at local level that will provide support both to programme refugees and to applicants for international protection. Work is being finalised to determine the respective roles of Local Authorities and NGOs in delivering the new integration model;</p><p>Work is ongoing to launch an integration fund in the coming months which will fund civil society organisations to support the integration of International Protection applicants;</p><p>A number of stakeholders meetings were held in the early part of 2022 including a briefing of the NGO sector which I was delighted to attend. Over 30 organisations were in attendance and were provided with a comprehensive update on how the implementation of the White Paper is progressing. Further briefings with the NGO sector will be held periodically.</p><p>Development of a Communication strategy including in February 2022 the launch of a dedicated webpage where all members of the Public can find updates on the progress being made in implementing the White Paper. Work will continue in 2022 to develop further, other avenues to ensure communities are fully briefed on implementation of the White Paper.</p><p>As deputies will appreciate the war in Ukraine has had an unavoidable impact on timelines for implementation of the White Paper, as staff in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth were temporarily diverted to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations including members of the White Paper Transition Team. Upwards of 33,000 Ukrainian refugees have come to Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive, and over 23,000 have been accommodated by the State. </p><p>Over the coming weeks, a review will be undertaken of project timelines with a view to presenting a revised implementation plan to the Programme Board.  This will take account of the delays that have arisen as a consequence of the Ukraine crisis and will consider its impacts on project implementation.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the impact of the Ukraine crisis, the implementation of the new model is and will continue to be a key priority for my department.  <b></b></p></reply>

A recent review of the NCS showed that:</p><p>38% of families reported that half or more of their early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS;</p><p>56% reported that they had more money to spend; and</p><p>28% reported that they were working more (with 8% reporting they would not be in work without the NCS). </p><p>I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability.</p><p>The recommendations of an Expert Group to develop a new funding model for early learning and childcare were adopted by Government in December. This new funding model marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p><p>An essential and top priority for the Funding Model Expert Group was to make recommendations for a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for early learning and childcare.</p><p>There are four specific recommendations on fee management, including the introduction of a fee freeze in the first instance, improvements to price comparability, and developments to the fee management system further to the assessment of cost data. </p><p>Fee management will start with a requirement of providers not to increase fees on September 2021 levels. The fee management system will be further developed in subsequent years, informed by income and cost data analysis.</p><p>The Expert Group made a further three specific recommendations on affordability, including amendments to the NCS and further development of subsidies linked to household income and expenditure or other criteria.</p><p>The Expert Group report informed the transformative package of measures for the sector committed to in Budget 2022, including the new &euro;221 million Core Funding stream. Core Funding will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability. </p><p>Core Funding will have a contractual requirement that fees between September 2022 and August 2023 are not greater than September 2021 levels. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the NCS and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  </p><p>Significant investment is being made by my Department to address affordability for parents through the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). I announced a number of changes to the Scheme as part of Budget 2022. These changes will be of significant benefit to many parents.</p><p>For instance, from 2 May, the NCS no longer deducts hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours &ndash; benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.</p><p>In September 2022, the NCS Universal subsidy will be extended to all children under 15 years of age &ndash; benefitting up to 40,000 children.</p><p>Both of these changes will result in more parents getting additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare.</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, my Department has ensured the sustainability of services and prevented the additional costs from public health measures being passed on to parents. ELC and SAC employers continued to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) until April 2022. </p><p>In advance of the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund is available to providers, contingent on an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. This fund will operate from the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme until the introduction of Core Funding (May-August 2022). </p><p>So far 93% of services have signed up to the Transition Fund. I am delighted that in return for this investment, the vast majority of parents will benefit from the operation of a fee freeze. Parents should feel confident and reassured knowing that in services participating in the Transition Fund, their ELC and SAC fees will not increase. This is the beginning of fee management that will now make it possible for substantial future investment to reduce parental fees over time. </p><p>Government has approved the recommendations of the Expert Group. Core Funding and the changes to NCS introduced in Budget 2022 begin the implementation of many of these wide ranging recommendations. Implementation will be further progressed in the coming years as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process. </p><p>The fee management system, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for families.</p></reply>

These notably included, in 2019, the introduction of two weeks paid Parent's Leave and Benefit for each parent in the first year of a child's life, extended in 2021 to five weeks to be taken within the first two years. Provision has been made in Budget 2022 to increase the number of weeks of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit available to eligible parents from five weeks to seven weeks from July 2022. Practical arrangements for the payment of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit are being finalised with the Department of Social Protection and a date for the commencement of the extension will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  The rates at which Maternity Benefit, Paternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit and Parent's Benefit are paid are matters for the Minister for Social Protection in the first instance. As a result of measures in Budget 2022, the rates of Maternity Benefit, Paternity Benefit, Adoptive Benefit and Parent's Benefit were increased by &euro;5 to &euro;250 a week, effective from January 2022. New parents are also eligible for Child Benefit which is paid at &euro;140 per month for each child. Any changes to the rate of Maternity Benefit would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  Family leave entitlements are kept under review to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of parents and children.  However, there are no plans at present to amend the maternity leave entitlements currently provided for under the Maternity Protection Acts.</p></reply>

Implementation of the NDIS is monitored by the NDIS Steering Group, which I chair.</p>  <p>  In addition, a Transport Working Group was established in 2020 to drive Action 104 of the NDIS but its work was paused to prioritise initial responses to the pandemic, while the work of the main NDIS Steering Group continued. </p>  <p>  Action 104 of the NDIS commits that &lsquo;we will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rsquo; </p>  <p>  The Transport Working Group's membership is made up of relevant Government Departments and state agencies including the National Disability Authority and the National Transport Authority. </p>  <p>  Following engagement from my colleague the Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe T.D. last year, it was decided to use the Transport Working Group to assist with the review of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme. Legislative and budgetary responsibility for the Scheme continues to lie with the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  The Transport Working Group met at the end of January this year at a meeting which I chaired. An update on the work of the group was also given to the Steering Group of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy in April. The current focus of the groups work is a stock taking exercise to scope and map the provision of transport supports across a range of government departments and state bodies. </p>  <p>  While delays have occurred in scheduling committees because officials have been temporarily diverted to the work to accommodate Ukrainian refugees, further meetings of the NDIS Steering Group and the Transport Working Group will be scheduled over the coming period. </p></reply>

It calls on Member States to guarantee for children in need, free access to early childhood education and care; education (including school-based activities); and healthcare; and to ensure effective access healthy nutrition, a healthy meal each school day and adequate housing.</p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s proposal emphasises that a Child Guarantee will only be effective if it triggers national investments and a &lsquo;supportive enabling policy framework&rsquo;.  The design of national action plans for its implementation is crucial to its success. The consultation process in relation to the National Action Plan for the implementation of the European Child Guarantee involved close engagement with the National Advisory Council for Children and Young People; input from key Departments and agencies across government; and online consultation resulting in twenty-one submissions from various organisations in January of this year. </p><p>The Child Guarantee will help Ireland to sharpen its response and frameworks towards the goal that all children can grow up with the same opportunities, and access to quality support services that will allow them to thrive in society and in a post pandemic world.As part of the obligations for Ireland under the European Child Guarantee, my Department has developed a National Action Plan for the implementation of the European Child Guarantee. </p><p>I am happy to report that I brought the National Action Plan for the European Child Guarantee to Government on 31st of May 2022.

Two extensions have been provided to Aramark, until the 9 November 2022. A new RFT process will be established for state owned centres this year. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Ukrainian Crisis specifically, Aramark was engaged by the Department on an emergency basis and at short notice to provide catering to Ukrainian Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection (BOTPs) from Ukraine at: </p>  <p>  The Green Glens Arena, Millstreet, Co.

Rather, the Department formed the view that in view of such urgency and in furtherance of the Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2022/382 of 4 March 2022 that it was open to my Department to rely on the exception under the applicable EU procurement Directive 2014/24 to negotiate directly without prior publication to put in place a number of short service contracts.</p>  <p>  Two separate communications from the European Commission of 8 and 23 March 2022 which states that &ldquo;Member States that need to ramp up reception capacity to provide shelter, supplies and services can make use of the rules foreseen for urgent public procurement, as was the case during the migration crisis of 2015-16 and the COVID-19 pandemic&rdquo; copper fastened my Department&rsquo;s view in this matter.</p>  <p>  At this stage of the emergency response to the Ukraine Crisis, it is not clear, and it is difficult to predict, as to whether or not this need will continue to be required after six months. An RFT for catering services is intended to be conducted prior to a six-month period from the service commencement date should the catering needs for Millstreet and Ballyogan continue beyond this timeframe.</p>  <p>  Separately, but related, my Department is being offered use of buildings and premises from religious orders, such as the Christian Brothers, and from various voluntary bodies that can be used for the accommodation of refugees. These buildings and premises require a third party facilities management service provider to be appointed to run them on the Department's behalf.  Aramark are one of a number of service providers that are being utilised, under Article 32 of the Directive, to provide full facilities management service.</p></reply>

It is wholly appropriate that it remains a prominent issue for discussion and warrants our attention. </p>  <p>  As you know the response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence is a cross-Departmental and multi-agency issue. With input from the Taoiseach, Minister McEntee and I have worked intensively with our officials on the Audit of the segmentation of Government&rsquo;s response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence and how the results of that audit fits with the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence.</p>  <p>  As a result of those discussions and in response to the Audit, we have agreed that the Department of Justice will become the lead Department with responsibility for responding to Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, and that responsibility for policy, accommodation and services will also sit within the Department of Justice. In the meantime, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, will continue to have responsibility for accommodation and services while the new administrative arrangements are put in place.</p>  <p>  In February 2022, the Minister for Justice and I jointly submitted a memorandum to the Government on the publication of Tusla's Accommodation Review. We requested the Government to note that the Programme for Government commits to implement a plan for future refuge space and recommends an approach to address this with immediate, medium and long term actions. We jointly issued a statement on the publication of the review.</p>  <p>  The ultimate goal is that everyone who needs a refuge space will get one, and we are all working with partners in the sector and across Government and its agencies to achieve that.</p>  <p>  A High Level Interdepartmental Group, as recommended by the Review, has been established to explore issues around refuge provision, service expansion and to identify changes that can be made to the system to deliver additional spaces as effectively as possible. As we progress this work we will be engaging with local authorities, government departments and State agencies across the country to source refuge provision. </p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Group is chaired by the Department of Justice, with members from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Department of Taoiseach and Tusla. I understand that the high level      Inter-Departmental Group, has met on a      number of occasions, and is due to report by the end of June.</p>  <p>  Timelines for delivery of additional places, as well as further targets for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation, will be outlined in the Department of Justice's Third National Strategy and further detail will be contained in the associated action plan.</p>  <p>  I strongly urge any group seeking to develop a refuge, notify Tusla in the first instance of their plans so they can be helped to progress them as appropriate.</p></reply>

Of the 22 actions, 7 have already been completed while another 13 are currently in progress. Work is ongoing in all thematic areas to advance measures in accordance with the published Action Plan. My Department and other state authorities are working to ensure survivors see tangible results as early as possible.</p>  <p>  In addition to an annual progress report, which will be laid before the Houses, my Department continues to prepare quarterly progress updates. On 31 May, the second of these updates was issued directly to every person who has provided their contact information to my Department's dedicated mailing list. The update was also published on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  Key achievements in implementing Government's Action Plan include:</p>  <p>  Firstly, dedicated professional counselling support continues to be available nationwide with services being prioritised for survivors. </p>  <p>  A centre-piece of the Government&rsquo;s response is the development of a scheme to provide eligible applicants with financial payments and a form of enhanced medical card.  The draft Heads of a Mother and Baby Institutions Payment  Scheme  Bill were published on 29 March. They were referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for pre-legislative scrutiny, requesting the Committee's assistance in meeting the urgent need to deliver this Scheme for survivors as soon as possible. In April, the Joint Oireachtas Committee undertook a public consultation process on the draft legislation. Hearings on the Heads of Bill have now commenced and my Department has engaged with the Committee.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the legislative process, my Department is working on the administrative arrangements needed to operate the Scheme and deal with applications.    </p>  <p>  My Department has also published two substantial pieces of legislation this year.    </p>  <p>The Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 was published on 12 January. The Bill has passed all stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is scheduled for Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on Wednesday the 1st June. This legislation will provide a full and clear right of access to birth certificates, birth and early life information for all persons who were adopted, boarded out, the subject of an illegal birth registration or who otherwise have questions in relation to their origins. </p>  <p>  The Institutional Burials Bill 2022 was published on 22 February. The Bill completed D&aacute;il Second Stage on 3 March and D&aacute;il Committee Stage on 3 May. Report Stage in the D&aacute;il is to be held on 15 June. The children in Tuam deserve an appropriate burial and I am determined to deliver legislation which achieves this dignity for them and their families and provides a clear legal basis should such intervention be necessary at other locations.   </p>  <p>  I established a dedicated Information Management Unit, with a professional archivist, to manage the Commission&rsquo;s archive of records and provide access for individuals to their personal information. So far, we have received 627 Subject Access Requests for information from the archive, and we have issued replies to 559 of these requests, with the remainder in progress. </p>  <p>  On 10 March 2022, the Minister for Health signed the new Data Protection Act 2018 (Access Modifications) (Health) Regulations 2022.  These Regulations remove the mandatory requirement to consult an individual&rsquo;s health practitioner before releasing their health data to them as part of a response to a Subject Access Request. My Department is now reviewing all Subject Access Request responses where information was previously withheld and working to provide health data to individuals as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, established a working group to develop central guidance which will assist local authorities in facilitating local memorialisation in line with the wishes of survivors. Consultation with survivors is integral to the operation of this working group. A consultative process, led by independent facilitators, will start in the coming weeks and survivor advocacy/representative groups have been invited to participate. In addition, the Minister is preparing a circular which will issue to all planning authorities advising them of the precautionary approach they should take to safeguarding possible burial sites in their area from potentially harmful development.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the urgency and sensitivity of this work and it is an absolute priority for myself and the Government.</p></reply>

Some 23,000 people have been referred for accommodation from my Department to date. </p><p>Offers of pledged accommodation from the general public are greatly appreciated. They are one means of assisting with the present challenge of finding suitable accommodation for those fleeing Ukraine.</p><p>Pledges of accommodation are taking place via the Irish Red Cross Portal as well as privately between parties.</p><p>The Government recently agreed to introduce a Recognition Payment Scheme of a monthly flat rate payment of &euro;400 per property in respect of individual properties (shared or vacant) that are pledged.</p><p>It is not assumed that the payment reflects actual costs incurred by the host family. It is a financial contribution that recognises the valued contribution of those who host. It will be available to those who have made private arrangements to host people, as well as pledges made through the Irish Red Cross.</p><p>Legislative proposals to underpin the scheme payments will be coordinated by the Department of Justice. It is expected to take 2 months to put in place, but payments will be backdated.</p><p>The administration of the Scheme will be carried out by the Department of Social Protection as an appropriate payment agent on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The payment will be conditional on a minimum time commitment for hosting (6 months), with payments continuing for hosting arrangements beyond this timeframe. </p><p>The application process will be based on principles of self-declaration/self-assessment with a requirement to provide PPSN and other details for the Ukrainians being hosted. Penalties will apply in the case of any false declarations made. </p><p>In recognition that some of those pledging their homes do not want financial recognition, the need to apply or make a claim for payment provides an important opt-out option for individuals owners who do not wish to access this State support. However, the generosity of these owners merits recognition.</p></reply>

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p><p>On 7th March, I announced the rates and values for the Core Funding, and launched the online Ready Reckoner tool. The Ready Reckoner is accessible to all and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics. It also allows different scenarios of provision to be tested. This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so.</p><p>My officials have engaged extensively with provider representatives and providers of all types and continue to do so, via various fora. </p><p>For example, on 12th April, senior officials in my Department met with a group of provider representatives to discuss issues regarding Core Funding. </p><p>In addition, on 4th May I, along with officials, met with a delegation from the Federation of Early Childhood Providers (FECP) to discuss their position in relation to the new Core Funding stream following a survey of their members. The FECP shared extremely detailed materials at this meeting, including case studies and extensive data on provider costs. My officials have examined these materials and issued a comprehensive response to the FECP and are awaiting further information by means of follow up. </p><p>While I accept that Core Funding is a new way of providing funding for the sector, and there is a lot of detailed material to be absorbed, I do not believe that there is a solid foundation in evidence for the concerns expressed by some that Core Funding will compromise services' viability.</p><p>In examining all of the data available to the Department, including that provided by the FECP following our meeting on 4<sup>th</sup>May, there is no evidence about a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding. </p><p>The sectoral information on income and costs does not show signs of financial unviability for ECCE-only services. In fact, the evidence suggests that ECCE-only services see the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring more stability of income for services, and that is one of the key objectives of Core Funding.  </p><p>The vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and around 1% of service will see no change. No service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be in place. This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.  This will be open to both private and community providers.</p><p>The Government is committed increasing investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare. As part of this, the new Core Funding package amounts to &euro;221 million in full year costs (&euro;173 million of which is new investment). </p><p>Every year a number of services close and others open. Current data on service closures and openings are not markedly different to the trend in previous years. This data also shows that services close for a wide range of reasons including retirement of owners or other personal circumstances and only a small minority relate to sustainability issues. </p><p>The &euro;221 million Core Funding budget is distributed to services in a fair and proportionate manner, based primarily on the features that determine services&rsquo; operating costs.  </p><p>Importantly, Core Funding and this significant increase in investment is the vehicle through which the Government will deliver improved pay and conditions for staff through supporting the drawing up of Employment Regulation Order for different roles of the sector by the Joint Labour Committee and through introduction new mechanisms to control parental fees. </p><p>It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that there is significant material relating to Core Funding available at <i>www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/Core-Funding/</i>. This public material was prepared in response to a number of queries received by my Department.</p><p>The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, educators and practitioners, and society overall.</p><p>This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding.</p><p>It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.</p><p>I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.</p></reply>

Activities by youth services and clubs are generally by their nature inclusive, and this is no exception. </p>  <p>  These activities often come within the eligibility requirements of funding for youth organisations and services. A communication confirming eligibility and coordination requirements for UBU Your Place Your Space was issued to ETBs.</p>  <p>  Ukrainian young people are being supported across a wide range of public services, including social protection, education, training, access to employment and access to language acquisition. Youth organisation and clubs are responding where it is appropriate. </p>  <p>  The coordination of local actions is important and the Community Response Forum in each of the local authority areas plays a vital role here.

In relation to accommodation, I wish to acknowledge the willingness of youth organisations to make available facilities normally used for residential or other services. Some examples of actions supported by my Department include:</p>  <p>  LGBT Ireland has been approved for &euro;68,000 to support the coordination of efforts by the LGBTI+ NGO sector to meet the needs of Ukrainian refugees, including young people, who are  LGBTI+. </p>  <p>  For&oacute;ige was approved to realign an existing grant to recruit a dedicated youth officer to consult and prepare a clear response to the identified needs of Ukrainian young people.</p>  <p>  The European Year of Youth micro grants scheme managed by Leargas, some &euro;200,000 in total, includes a priority for projects supporting youth people from Ukraine and to examine topics with young people such as democracy, solidarity or preventing disinformation.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in a significant effort to provide accommodation for Ukrainian refugees, initially on an emergency basis.

On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 17 of the report by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection was that a State inquiry into illegal adoptions (broadly defined) should be established on a non-statutory basis. </p>  <p>  The question of creating an effective non-statutory inquiry is a sensitive, complex and challenging one.  The Special Rapporteur acknowledges this and, in particular, notes the challenges associated with access to records for a non-statutory inquiry.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to delivering on the comprehensive suite of actions set out in the Government Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions. These actions respond to the priority needs and wishes of survivors, their families and advocates, and some actions achieve objectives of a Truth Commission as proposed by the Special Rapporteur. In March of this year, Government approved high-level proposals for a National Centre for Research and Remembrance.  The National Centre will stand as a site of conscience and will be designed to be an enduring and educational memorial to honour all those who were resident in Industrial Schools, Mother and Baby Homes, Magdalen Laundries and related institutions. The National Centre will be located on the site of the former Magdalen Laundry in Sean MacDermott Street in Dublin city centre and will have an inclusive, national and global reach.</p>  <p>  The Centre will comprise a number of distinct, yet interrelated, areas, including a museum and exhibition space, the development of which will be led by the National Museum of Ireland; and a place for reflection and remembrance. In addition, it will contain a research centre and central repository of records related to institutional trauma in the 20th century, which will form part of the National Archives. It is anticipated that the central repository will sit at the heart of the Centre and will ultimately be underpinned by legislation. One unique aspect of the central repository will be the intended inclusion of the personal testimonies of survivors; allowing the lived experiences of survivors to be formally accepted as part of the official record. Inclusion of the personal testimonies of survivors will ensure that the lived experiences of survivors will be captured in their own words, for publication and archiving for posterity in the National Centre.  </p>  <p>  The Government Action Plan also contains important measures which are focused on access to records.  </p>  <p>  In setting out this comprehensive suite of commitments, the Government recognises the potential for a future centralised archive of institutional records and personal testimony to support further analysis and research on these important matters.   </p>  <p>  As a consequence of all of this ongoing work, the Government will need to give further consideration to the specific recommendation on the Truth Commission. In the coming months, my priority will be to implement the Action Plan and deliver Birth Information and Tracing legislation, which will provide full, unredacted access to birth and early life information for people affected by illegal birth registration, adopted people, and anyone with questions as to their origins. </p></reply>

The discussions that have been held on this issue have been primarily at the level of officials.  </p>  <p>  The National Housing Strategy for Disabled People 2022 &ndash; 2027 sets out the Government&rsquo;s vision for delivering housing and related supports for disabled people. The overarching vision of the Strategy is to facilitate people with disabilities to live independently and to have their housing needs met in the community. Officials in my Department provided input into the Strategy. The Strategy was a joint publication between my Department, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Health. Responsibility for coordination of the Strategy lies with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  In terms of the more general involvement of my Department in the promotion of accessible housing for people with disabilities, the National Disability Authority (NDA), which is funded and supported by my Department, operates a Centre for Excellence in Universal Design (CEUD).

Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at Irish ports, including airports.   </p>  <p>  Tusla has a significant role, as part of the State&rsquo;s overall response, to support individuals, particularly women and children, displaced from Ukraine, as a result of the war and coming into Ireland. Tusla is committed to balancing the needs of families in a humanitarian crisis, with its child protection responsibilities, and requirement to support families and promote the welfare of children. </p>  <p>  SCSIP who arrive at ports of entry to Ireland are referred to Tusla for a child protection needs assessment. In the first instance, Tusla makes every attempt to contact relatives of the child and to reunite the child with family members or friends. If children cannot be reunified with family or friends, they are received into the care of Tusla. </p>  <p>  These children are placed by Tusla either in small specialist residential care centres, or with specifically recruited foster families under a Failte Foster care programme. The children are automatically entitled as children in care to a medical card and access to education services. In addition, a Social Worker is allocated to them to develop a care plan and monitor the progress of the child / young person&rsquo;s care. The care plan may involve specialist English language tuition, intensive educational supports and therapeutic work in respect of trauma. </p>  <p>  Children who arrive in Ireland outside of a dedicated refugee programme are supported in their application for refugee status. </p>  <p>  Assisting children with reunification with their families has evolved as a key piece of the support social workers provide to those who are eligible to apply.  Where relevant the process of reunification is started as soon as the children come to the attention of Tusla.  </p>  <p>  All Ukrainian citizens and third country nationals living in the Ukraine who seek international protection in Ireland will receive temporary protection status.

There are currently 60 separated children from Ukraine in Tusla's care.</p>  <p>  To date all separated children who have arrived have been accommodated within current resources. If a significant number of separated children arrive and all require accommodation, my Department will consider changes to the maximum number of children who may be accommodated together under current standards in consultation with Tusla and key stakeholders.

It is also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free pre-school (ECCE) programme.  </p>  <p>  The Income Assessed Subsidy is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. It is means tested and is calculated based on individual circumstances. Those on the lowest incomes receive the highest subsidies. </p>  <p>  The NCS is  designed to be flexible and accommodate busy parents&rsquo; lives. The attendance rules for the scheme facilitate the need for flexibility and recognise that, in practical terms, parents are constrained by a range of individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Scheme acknowledges that early learning and childcare needs differ widely across different families. That is why subsidies are offered on an hourly basis. The NCS allows for flexible arrangements to be made depending on the parents&rsquo; needs. </p>  <p>  The Scheme has been designed to be flexible in its application process as well. The online application allows for the parent to complete the process at their own pace, and parents have the option of completing a paper application by post. The system caters for applications from all family types, and no one family type is in any way disadvantaged.</p>  <p>  As part of the monitoring, review and evaluation of the NCS, Frontier Economics was commissioned to undertake a formal review of the first year of the NCS, with the report published in December 2021. The report noted that early learning and childcare costs in Ireland have been found to be a significant factor in contributing to low levels of participation in employment, education and training for mothers, particularly for lone parents. The NCS was designed to make early learning and childcare more affordable and, in some instances, free. In this regard, the report highlights that among claimants of the income-assessed subsidy, around a third were lone parents. It further noted that lone parents had a substantially higher mean hourly rate than couples, leading to a substantially higher mean weekly value for claims.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman announced a number of changes to the NCS, which will be of significant benefit to many parents. </p>  <p>  These changes will result in more parents getting additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare in Tusla registered services by extending the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 - benefitting up to 40,000 children. </p>  <p>  A further change, introduced in May of this year, ended the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children.</p>  <p>  Finally, Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, is a universal programme available to all children within the eligible age range. The programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week over 38 weeks, and the programme year runs from September to June. A child must have turned 2 years and 8 months on or before the 31st August of a given programme year in order to be eligible (and cannot turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year).</p>  <p>  2022 will see up to &euro;73m being made available for Core funding, which equates to &euro;221m in full year costs. It will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the NCS and ECCE.</p>  <p>  Once core funding is embedded and the concurrent changes to ECCE and NCS take effect, my Department will be looking to build a wider strategy targeting disadvantage informed by the work of the Expert Group across ELC settings. This strategy will aim to provide for a proportionate mix of universal supports and for targeted supports to support services and families who use them in alleviating the effects of socio -economic disadvantage.</p></reply>

Supplementing the supports and services being provided by government agencies a local level, the fora provide for  communication and information sharing in the coordination of local community and voluntary actions in providing community supports to the new Ukrainian communities.</p>  <p>  Through the efforts of local volunteers, community workers, public bodies and private sector contributions, many recent arrivals are being supported with basic needs such as clothing, access to the internet, transport, English classes and information on how to access local services such as childcare, healthcare and education. </p>  <p>  Other areas of my Department are also actively supporting arrivals from Ukraine. </p>  <p>  The Early Years Division in my Department has taken responsibility for a number of actions supporting Ukrainian parents and children, allowing them to access preschool and ensuring children&rsquo;s wellbeing. These actions have included the development and translation of introductory information on the Irish early learning and care sector. A capacity analysis across the country identified vacant preschool places and work is ongoing to match children to the vacant places and to create additional early childhood care and education, ECCE, places, where possible, in areas of high demand. Information on the access and inclusion model for children with disabilities accessing preschool has been translated into Ukrainian and Russian.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also put additional staff into its services around educational welfare too in order to support the work of linking students to school places. </p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007. </p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation - each year moving forward on key reforms, with the obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments and requirements.</p>  <p>  Ireland submitted its Initial State Report on the implementation of the UNCRPD to the UN Committee in November 2021, following extensive consultation with persons with disabilities, disabled persons organisations, representative organisations, and families. My Department is currently awaiting a review date from the UN Committee to evaluate progress made to date. The review was originally anticipated to occur in 2022. However, this has been postponed due to backlogs at UN level. There is no indication at this time on a likely date for Ireland&rsquo;s appearance at the Committee.</p>  <p>  My Department coordinates delivery of two whole-of-government national strategies, which aim to support delivery of Ireland's obligations under the UNCRPD.</p>  <p>  Firstly, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), contains 123 actions to support effective progress in meeting the needs of people with disabilities in Ireland.  Implementation of the NDIS is monitored in regular NDIS Steering Group meetings through a reporting system which requires Government Departments and Agencies to detail their progress biannually. The group is supported by independent analysis and advice from the National Disability Authority (NDA). </p>  <p>  Secondly, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), is the primary disability employment policy initiative in Ireland. It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to the employment of persons with disabilities. Implementation of the CES is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson. </p>  <p>  While there is still much work to be done, important progress has been made in implementing the UNCRPD to date. This includes the formation of a number of whole-of-government working groups to address specific challenges in areas such as transitions across state services, transport and the use of assistive technologies. Various policy actions and financial supports have also been introduced under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy to address the specific challenges faced by persons with disabilities in accessing equal employment. The introduction of the Access and Inclusion Model for early learning and care and the legal recognition granted to Irish Sign Language are also key achievements. </p>  <p>  On 1st May this year I introduced the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 to the D&aacute;il, and will work with colleagues to see the law passed before the end of the summer session. This will be a key step  in Ireland's realisation of the Convention, and will introduce a number of important legislative reforms, such as the abolition of wardship and the establishment of new, rights based decision support arrangements, a doubling of the statutory minimum targets for the employment of persons with disabilities, legislating for IHREC's role as the monitoring body for the UNCRPD, and removing references to persons of "unsound mind" standing for election.   </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

I have spoken to the House on this issue previously. I am aware of the importance and need for refuge provision across the country.  </p>  <p>  The response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV) is a cross-Departmental and multi-agency issue. </p>  <p>  With input from the Taoiseach, Minister McEntee and I have worked intensively with our officials on the Audit of the segmentation of Government&rsquo;s response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence and how the results of that Audit fits with the, soon to be published, Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence .</p>  <p>  As a result of those discussions and in response to the Audit, it has been agreed that the Department of Justice will be the lead Department with responsibility for responding to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, and that responsibility for policy, accommodation and services will also sit within the Department of Justice. Tusla will continue to have responsibility for accommodation and services while the new administrative arrangements are put in place.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency provides supports for victims of domestic violence primarily through funded NGO service providers.</p>  <p>  In 2021, Tusla allocated &euro;28m in core funding for DSGBV services plus &euro;2m in contingency funding to address challenges arising from COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Overall funding of measures to deal with Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence has increased from &euro;23.8m in 2018 to approximately &euro;31m in 2022. Funding in 2022 will support services to address cost pressures and maintain continuity of services.</p>  <p>  Tusla published it's &lsquo;Review of the Provision of Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence&rsquo; in mid February of this year. The Review assesses distribution of safe emergency accommodation and examined the level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities. </p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Group, led by a senior official in the Department of Justice, has been established to examine the physical delivery of refuge accommodation, identify obstructions to delivery, address the perception of significant delays in provision and identify how they can be shortened.</p>  <p>  Priority areas have been identified where there is greatest urgency in achieving safe accommodation for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. There will be engagement with local authorities, Government departments and State agencies to source refuge provision. Work continues with partners to improve access to services and supports for victims.</p></reply>

The significant structural changes required across large parts of the economy will affect different groups in society in different ways, and tailored and targeted responses are required to ensure that this transition is fair and equitable for all and that existing inequalities are not exacerbated.The Climate Action Plan 2021 (CAP 2021) sets out a just transition framework to guide our approach to implementing our climate action policies. The framework is made up of four principles: </p><p>1.  An integrated, structured, and evidence-based approach to identify and plan our response to just climate transition requirements.</p><p>2. People are equipped with the right skills to be able to participate in and benefit from the future net-zero economy. </p><p>3. The costs are shared so that the impact is equitable and existing inequalities are not exacerbated.</p><p>4. Social dialogue to ensure impacted citizens and communities are empowered and are core to the transition process.</p><p>Under CAP 2021, the Government has also committed to establishing a statutory Just Transition Commission. To inform the approach for the legislation, I am developing a policy approach for the mandate of the proposed Commission. I envisage that the Commission will support the Government in implementing its climate policies through: </p><p>1. Monitoring progress and making recommendations in relation to the implementation of the just transition framework across Government.</p><p>2. Commissioning research, and identifying research needs, in order to facilitate evidence-based decision making across Government regarding a just transition.</p><p>3. Providing advice and support to the Minister and Government in relation to stakeholder participation and dialogue in a manner which effectively integrates just transition considerations.</p><p>4. Examining just transition challenges arising in specific sectors and developing recommendations on potential solutions to address these challenges.I intend to engage further with stakeholders during the coming months, to further inform the Government's approach to the proposed legislation. I expect to be in a position to bring forward the General Scheme of the required legislation by the end of this year. </p></reply>

The EU External Energy Strategy will facilitate energy diversification and building long-term partnerships with suppliers, including cooperation on hydrogen or other green technologies. The Strategy prioritises the EU's commitment to the global green and just energy transition, increasing energy savings and efficiency to reduce the pressure on prices, boosting the development of renewables and hydrogen, and stepping up energy diplomacy. </p>  <p>  The National Energy Security Framework, approved by Government in April 2022, provides a single overarching and initial response to address Ireland&rsquo;s energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine. It sets out a &lsquo;Whole-of Government&rsquo; response to the challenges posed to energy security and energy affordability. The development of this Framework has taken account of the need to decarbonise our society and economy as set out in recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  and  Ireland&rsquo;s targets to reduce emissions by 51% over the decade to 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. </p></reply>

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland. The Housing for All plan commits to the retrofitting of 36,500 local authority homes by 2030 as part of the achievement of these targets.   The Retrofit Plan estimates that, between 2019 and 2025, almost 185,000 home energy upgrades will be delivered with over 83,000 to a B2/cost optimal level. When the emissions savings from the non-B2 upgrades are included, this is the equivalent of 120,000 B2 upgrades over the period. As a result, there will a need to deliver, on average, approximately 75,000 B2-equivalent home upgrades per year from 2026 to 2030 to achieve the overall target of 500,000 by 2030.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan and National Retrofit Plan have ring-fenced &euro;8 billion to support the achievement of this objective.

It is proposed as a 575km long, with 500km of this being subsea, 700MW cable connecting the north-west coast of France to the south coast of Ireland. At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes.The Celtic Interconnector will provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that will have significant benefits for electricity consumers in Ireland. The project will provide access to the European internal energy market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland. It will also enhance security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via export access to the mainland European markets.</p><p>In late 2019, the European Commission announced a grant of &euro;530 million towards the construction of the interconnector under the Connecting Europe Facility fund. Following extensive planning and multiple periods of public consultation over the past number of years, EirGrid decided last year on the interconnector&rsquo;s route in East Cork. EirGrid have further decided to establish an enhanced community benefit scheme for neighbouring communities. EirGrid will continue to engage with the public on this project in the coming months and years.</p><p>While I have no function in the area of consenting for the interconnector, I understand from EirGrid that applications to all relevant consenting authorities are now submitted and planning permission for the onshore elements of the project in Ireland was granted in May 2022.</p></reply>

ComReg advises that the current minimum coverage obligations in those licences are being considerably exceeded by all operators.    Capital investment by telecommunications operators over the last 5 years was in the order of &euro;3.3 billion for both fixed and mobile services. This has significantly enhanced the availability of services, both voice and data, throughout Ireland, including in rural areas. Telecommunication operators have committed to continued investment programmes in the coming years, estimated to be in the region of &euro;700m per annum.  </p>  <p>  ComReg is in the process of running another Multi-band Spectrum Award to assign rights of use in four spectrum bands. The award comprises 470 MHz of spectrum and represents a 46% increase in the harmonised spectrum assigned for the provision of wireless broadband services in Ireland. This will significantly enable the market to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data and new services.  </p>  <p>  To assist consumers to choose the network provider that best meets their needs, ComReg has developed a national outdoor coverage map. This map which is available on the ComReg website provides consumers with very clear information on where operators have good 2G, 3G and 4G coverage. </p>  <p>  Since 2016 the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce has been a driving force for improving access to telecommunications services nationwide. It has completed over 70 targeted actions to alleviate connectivity barriers and continues to tackle issues impeding the rollout of mobile and fixed connectivity. </p>  <p>  The continued investment by commercial operators and by the State through the National Broadband Plan will ensure that Ireland is set to become the EU leader in connectivity by the second half of this decade. </p></reply>

I am further advised that almost 67,700 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties, with over 56,600 premises passed across 22 counties and available for immediate connection and almost 11,900 premises connected, demonstrating the project continues to gain momentum. </p><p>My Department has worked with NBI to agree an Updated Interim Remedial Plan (UIRP) which recalibrated the targets for 2022 to take account of the knock on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the programme. The revised target is 102,000 premises passed by the end of January 2023 (cumulative).  </p><p>NBI are implementing a number of measures to help lessen the impact that delays have had on the rollout. Such measures include:</p><p>Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month</p><p>Bringing in additional NBI resources </p><p>Earlier procurement of materials used in the build stages</p><p>Bringing in additional subcontractors.</p><p>The focus will continue to be on ensuring that the NBI build programme is back on track and is gaining momentum month on month. </p><p>The total cost of the NBP programme since 2016, when the procurement process commenced, is &euro;269.07 million. This figure largely comprises the first thirty-three subsidy payments to NBI amounting to &euro;220.04 million in relation to the construction of the National Broadband Plan (NBP) high-speed broadband network.  It also includes fees for external advisors, who supported the Department's NBP team during the procurement process and who now assist the Department in governing and monitoring the contract obligations of NBI.</p></reply>

Of this, 500MW is targeted to come from Community-based projects.  </p>  <p>  Community supports under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) will be key components of delivering on this ambition. The RESS is an auction-based support scheme which invites grid-scale renewable electricity generation projects to compete to receive a guaranteed price for the electricity they generate. The scheme includes a dedicated Community Category developed specifically to allow communities and citizens to participate in and benefit from RESS. In the first RESS auction, 7 Community projects were successful, two of which were 100% community owned, the remainder being at least 51% community owned. For RESS-2 onwards all community projects must be 100% community owned. There were 10 Community projects identified as provisional winners in the recent RESS-2 auction.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Community Enabling Framework includes a package of enabling supports including technical, financial and legal services which has been rolled out to assist communities in navigating the challenging terrain of electricity generation. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is leading in implementing and facilitating these components of the framework. In 2022, &euro;2 million in capital funding has been allocated to support the development of Community projects, which allowed the SEAI to roll out a trusted advisory service and enabling grants on 21st April 2022. These are vital supports to enable the growth of the nascent community renewable electricity generation sector.   </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan also commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generation (>50kW) to support the deployment of rooftop and ground-mounted solar PV in cohorts that are not as suited to other support measures. This will enable farmers, auto-generators and communities to maximise their participation in the energy transition. The design of the scheme will be progressed in 2022 and it is expected to become available in 2023.</p></reply>

It is estimated that the overall investment costs of new utility-scale PV and onshore wind plants are from 15% to 25% higher in 2022.</p>  <p>  While bid prices were higher than the first auction, owing mainly to international inflationary pressures in input costs, renewable energy delivered under the scheme will pay back to consumers when wholesale electricity prices are high through the Public Service Obligation Levy.  RESS 2 bid prices are also fixed over the lifetime of the support with no increases from indexing to inflation.   </p>  <p>  Renewable energy delivered under the RESS  2 auction will shield consumers from high prices, reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels in the context of the phasing out of Russian energy imports across the EU and contribute to communities across the country. More broadly, renewable energy generation such as wind and solar lowers wholesale electricity prices during periods when they are generating power.</p>  <p>  Community-led projects can have higher costs than developer led projects due to economies of scale, and reliance on external services to deliver projects. The Community Enabling Framework for community-led projects includes a package of supports including technical, financial and legal services to assist communities in navigating the challenging terrain of electricity generation.</p>  <p>  The electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European Union regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive.

This is due to go to public consultation shortly with a view to approval by the Oireachtas later this year. To facilitate switching to renewable energy sources I bought forward the final design of the Micro-Generation Support Scheme (MSS) which was approved by Government in December 2021. </p><p>The Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) is targeting support for 380MW of installed micro-generation capacity, to contribute to the target of up to 2.5GW of solar renewables under the Climate Action Plan. Micro-generation has an important role to play as it creates opportunities for domestic, school, farming and small commercial customers to take the first steps towards investment in renewable technologies, by generating and consuming their own electricity, which can play a role in shaping electricity demand and decarbonising homes and businesses. </p><p>The MSS will provide capital grants for non-domestic applicants, such as schools, for solar PV installations up to 6.0kW primarily for self-consumption, with grant levels up to a maximum of &euro;2,400 available. This will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and will become available to the non-domestic sector for installations up to 6.0kW in July this year. </p><p>In addition, on 15 February this year I signed the Regulations that create an obligation on suppliers to offer the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity that they may export to the grid, reflective of the market value. </p><p>In Quarter 3 of this year when the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will consult on an implementation plan for the Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff, a guaranteed export tariff support for new installations which is fixed for 15 years for non-domestic applicants for installations greater than 6.0kW up to 50kW in size. </p></reply>

Engagement with businesses and local community groups will build on previous engagements carried out by my Department through the DRS sub-group and public consultation processes, and will be further considered along with other operational issues by the operator during the design of the scheme. </p></reply>

These regulations will introduce minimum quality standards that will apply across all solid fuels, to ensure that the most polluting can no longer be made available on the Irish market and to assist the public in transitioning to less polluting alternatives.   The new regulations are necessary as each year some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning. It is estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution.</p>  <p>  Throughout the course of three different forms of public consultation, undertaken over the past 18 months, the direction of travel has been made clear. To address this public health and environmental crisis, new solid fuel regulations will be introduced across a range of fuels to ensure that the most polluting will no longer be available for general sale on the Irish market and that as particulate matter comes from burning not only bituminous coal but other solid fuels, that we must now regulate to improve the standards of all fuels available on our market.  </p>  <p>  Government has been equally clear that turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatlands and that measures are required to reduce the emissions associated with burning peat, but which respect these traditions. </p>  <p>  The regulations which will ultimately be agreed by Government will ensure, that while measures are introduced to enhance the quality of our air, they will not impinge upon traditional local practices associated with sod peat.</p></reply>

I am further advised that almost 67,700 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties, with over 56,600 premises passed across 22 counties and available for immediate connection. </p><p>NBI has advised that almost 5,800 premises have been passed in County Cork. Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. </p><p>NBI has made recent improvements to its website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: <i>www.nbi.ie/reps</i><i>.</i>NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 20 May, 584 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 23 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date.  Further details can be found at <i>nbi.ie/bcp-locations/</i>.  </p><p>In County Cork 45 schools have been installed by NBI to date.  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at <i>nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></p><p>With regard to engagement with NBI, my Department as the contracting authority manages all of the elements of contract governance and engages with NBI on an ongoing basis across all elements of the programme to deliver the new high speed broadband network. It remains the ambition of the Government to rollout the National Broadband Plan State led intervention as quickly as possible in all areas, including mid and South West Cork, and to achieve this NBI will continue its focus on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p></reply>

All applications by offshore wind energy projects for development consent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will involve full public consultation.</p><p>My Department is considering all submissions on the public consultation on draft terms and conditions for the first offshore wind auction under the Offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS);  a formal consultation response, to include local communities&rsquo; submissions, will issue in the coming weeks. Successful projects under the ORESS will be required to make significant community benefit fund contributions from an early stage in the lifecycle of an offshore wind project. </p><p>My Department is also progressing work on the second Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan. This will set out a pathway for the long-term sustainable development of Ireland's offshore renewable energy resources. As work on this plan is progressed during 2022, public participation will be sought, particularly from those in coastal communities, in addition to key stakeholders to ensure a wide variety of views are captured in the development of this plan.</p></reply>

The communication proposes further short-term measures in the gas and electricity sectors to tackle effectively the impact of sustained high energy prices on consumers and companies. One measure identified within the communication relates to subsidising the cost of gas used for power generation, which the Commission highlights, depending on their design may entail significant costs.   However, while this measure has been identified in regions with very limited interconnection and where gas has a strong influence on the price of electricity, as is the case in the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM), it is also considered most effective where consumers are particularly exposed to pass-through wholesale electricity prices. While this is the case in Spain, for example, where a considerable proportion of consumers are on electricity tariffs that are directly linked to the wholesale price, this is not true of the SEM, where very few consumers are on such pass-through tariffs. Irish domestic customer contracts are almost exclusively based on hedged contracts by suppliers, limiting the exposure of customers to sudden increases in wholesale gas costs. We await further detail from the Commission regarding the implementation of this option in Spain and Portugal, which will allow for further consideration by Member States. </p></reply>

The measures address barriers to undertaking energy upgrades (retrofits) reported by homeowners and those working in the industry. They also reflect the step-change needed &ndash; in pace and scale of delivery &ndash; to build toward achieving our ambitious target of 500,000 home energy upgrades, to B2 Building Energy Rating (BER) standard, in this decade.    The changes represent an important step in delivery of the National Retrofit Plan, which identifies a range of measures aimed at driving demand for retrofit, expanding the size and capacity of the supply chain, as well as making retrofits more affordable.</p>  <p>  Following the announcements, demand for the SEAI residential energy efficiency schemes has been very strong. The SEAI advise that to the end of April over 13,500 applications have been received across a range of its residential schemes including Better Energy Homes Scheme; Warmer Homes Scheme; Solar PV scheme; and National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme. This represents approximately 65% of all applications received throughout 2021.</p>  <p>  The SEAI has been designated as the National Retrofit Delivery Body. In this role, the SEAI will act as the lead agency in driving the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s retrofit targets.</p>  <p>  While a cohort of staff within SEAI are involved in a range of administrative functions that support schemes, the agency is also assisted by a service provider that provides the front-end customer service.</p>  <p>  Significant additional funding is being provided by the Government to continue to increase the capacity of the Agency. The process of developing, restructuring and recruiting the necessary expertise commenced in 2021 and will continue in parallel with the delivery of the National Retrofit Plan. </p>  <p>  SEAI are enhancing their staffing levels this year consistent with the scaling up of capacity to support the significant policy developments announced earlier this year under the National Retrofit Plan. Up to 50 additional staff are to be employed by the agency by the end of the year bring staff levels close to 190.</p></reply>

The Policy and the proposed measures contained in it apply to both imported and indigenous supply of fuels. The Policy supports the decarbonising transport actions under the Climate Action Plan 2021 and the envisaged increase in the share of renewable fuels in transport use under the EU Renewable Energy Directive.  </p>  <p>  The measures in the policy seek to implement the Climate Action Plan target for 2030, by means of annual increases in biofuel blending obligations on transport fuel suppliers leading to increases in ethanol blending in petrol (of 10% from the current 5%) and biodiesel in diesel up to 20% by 2030. Incentives for supply of biomethane and green hydrogen supply and use in transport is proposed by means of multiplier credits for supply of such fuels which can be offset against the higher biofuel blending obligation.</p>  <p>  The Policy reiterates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to ensure maintenance of the highest standards of sustainability of fuel supply in transport. In this regard the Department is carrying out a study in 2022 concerning the sustainability and availability of biofuels and development of renewable fuels to 2030, which will equally address imported and indigenous supply.</p>  <p>  More generally in relation to ensuring the security of Irish fuel supplies, under its membership of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Union, Ireland is required to hold strategic oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports. The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, is the State Agency with responsibility for ensuring that Ireland meets its obligations in relation to maintaining a minimum of 90 days reserve stocks of petroleum products which may be utilised in the event of a physical shortage of supplies. </p>  <p>  The oil supply position on the Irish markets is kept under constant review. </p></reply>

The work on the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan II involves participation across Government and the collation of available, relevant data on our marine resource. Key stakeholders from the economic, environmental, and social pillars are regularly engaging in the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan Advisory Group to share expertise, knowledge and local perspectives. As work on this plan is progressed during 2022, public participation will be sought, particularly from those in coastal communities, to ensure a wide variety of views are captured. On behalf of my Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland engaged environmental consultants to carry out environmental assessments on the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan II including a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). The Scoping Report for the Strategic Environmental Assessment was the subject of a recent consultation which closed on 27th May 2022. Screening for an Appropriate Assessment (AA) is also been undertaken in respect of the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan II.

However, my Department has provided funding for a significant upgrade to the network in recent years, and the number of monitoring stations has increased from 29 in 2017 to 102 today.The final expansion of the network will be completed this year and the EPA has recently advised this will increase the number of official stations to 116.All stations collect air quality data for a range of pollutants in order to provide information to the public, and for assessment against European legal limit values and World Health Organisation guideline values. Details of the locations of all monitoring stations currently in operation, along with real-time and historic data from each station, can be found at the EPA-operated website, <i>www.airquality.ie</i>.</p><p>  While Ireland has traditionally focused on measurements from monitoring stations to assess air quality, it is recognised that there is a need to provide more local air quality information throughout the country. The intention is that the information generated through monitoring, will be augmented by a newly developed modelling and forecasting capability, which will provide an ongoing air quality forecast service to the public. </p><p>  This work is being developed as part of a new EU LIFE funded project called LIFE EMERALD, which will use the information from our monitoring network to provide a national 3-day air quality forecast and near real-time mapping of air pollutants throughout the country. This will improve our ambient air quality management capabilities, and enable us to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to poor air quality, while developing a system that will provide enhanced information to the public. </p></reply>

In February, as part of the delivery of the Retrofit Plan, the Government approved a package of supports including a new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme (NHEUS) providing increased grant levels of up to 50% (up from 30%-35%) of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard. These supports address the barriers to undertaking deeper energy retrofits reported by homeowners and those working in the industry. They also reflect the step-change needed &ndash; in pace and scale of delivery &ndash; to achieve our Climate Action Plan target. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of the NHEUS and other enhanced supports in February, demand for SEAI retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high with a very significant increase in the number of applications year to date when compared to the same period in 2021. The SEAI advise that five One Stop Shops have now been registered and can be found listed on the SEAI website at: https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-shop/registered-providers/.  The SEAI is actively working with other applicant organisations to support them through this registration process.</p>  <p>  The National Retrofit Plan includes supply chain development as one of its pillars and has a range of measures that aim to increase the capacity of the sector.  The Plan also sets out the unprecedented level of funding to support the achievement of our retrofit targets &ndash; &euro;8 billion of Exchequer funding to 2030.  This funding will give confidence and certainty to the sector to grow, take on staff, invest and innovate.</p>  <p>  The Government has also taken a number of tangible steps to ensure that we have the required number of skilled workers to deliver on our targets. These include: </p>  <p>  - 4,550 retrofit and NZEB standard places this year as part of the Department of Further and Higher Education Green Skills Action Programme</p>  <p>  - Three retrofit centres of excellence are in operation with 2 more to be in place by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  - Supports available for employers to take on apprentices.</p>  <p>  - The Housing for All &ldquo;FutureBuilding&rdquo; initiative to recruit construction workers was launched by Minister Humphreys and Minister Harris on 5th May.</p>  <p>  We also want to make it easier and more attractive for school leavers to take the option of a career in the new green economy. For that reason, the CAO website now includes information on apprenticeship options with a link to www.apprenticeship.ie.</p></reply>

Maintaining security of supply while integrating greater levels of renewable generation will require a very high penetration of variable electricity on the Irish grid, with increased storage capacity providing a low-carbon substitute for high greenhouse gas emitting power generation fuels, such as peat and coal.EirGrid has reported that a number of battery projects have been contracted via two mechanisms: SEM Capacity Auctions and DS3 Systems Services. There is currently approximately 500MW of short duration batteries on the all-island system providing system services, as well as 292MW of pumped hydro storage. There are also approximately 500MW of batteries either connected, or contracted to connect to the system over the next four years, to provide capacity to the all island power system. In addition, EirGrid will soon publish the final results of the second Renewable Electricity Support Scheme which makes provision to couple renewable generation with storage capability at project sites. This will help to broaden the energy mix and support security of supply.</p><p>  The Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2021 acknowledges the critical role of energy storage in supporting a power system comprised of up to 80 per cent renewables and the need to develop storage capacity. My Department has committed to developing an electricity storage policy framework that supports the 2030 CAP targets and supports increased storage capacity. The framework is due to be published early next year. In combination, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities will be reviewing the regulatory treatment of storage, including licensing, charging and market incentives, which is to be completed by the end of 2023.</p></reply>

These levies will work in a similar way to the plastic bag levy, which has been so successful in tackling plastic bag litter.  These new environmental levies will be introduced incrementally, with the initial focus on the introduction of levies on single-use disposable hot drinks cups later this year as well as a ban on their use in sit-in caf&eacute;s. </p><p>All proceeds from levies introduced under the Bill will be ringfenced in a Circular Economy Fund to support environmental projects and initiatives. The purposes for which payments may be made from the Circular Economy Fund are specified in section 8(9) of the Bill.</p><p>Numerous Life Cycle Analyses (LCAs) of re-usable cups have found that these cups have a lower overall environmental impact than disposable cups, provided the re-usable cup is used enough times and washed efficiently. The &lsquo;breakeven&rsquo; number of uses required will vary depending on the material a re-usable cup is made from, and the type of disposable cup compared to, but can be as low as between 10-25 uses. A meta-analysis of such studies co-commissioned by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) can be found at: <i>www.lifecycleinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/UNEP_-LCA-Beverage-Cups-Report_Web.pdf</i>.</p><p>The measures included in the Bill, including in relation to environmental levies and bans, have already undergone public and extensive stakeholder consultation. Those elements of the Bill derived from commitments under the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy (WAPCE) were subject to stakeholder consultation during the preparation of that document, from December 2019 to June 2020, including through the Waste Advisory Group which included representatives from the hospitality sector. Initial proposals in relation to additional environmental levies were also subject to an earlier public consultation launched in November 2019. The first Whole-of-Government Strategy for the Circular Economy, which was published on 16 December 2021 was also the subject of a public consultation during Summer 2021. </p><p>The majority of the feedback across these consultation processes has been strongly supportive of an increased emphasis on achieving a circular economy. As many measures included in the Bill &ndash; including the introduction of environmental levies and any subsequent bans - will ultimately be given effect by way of secondary legislation, my Department intends to carry out additional public consultations on the detailed measures contained in such draft regulations. </p><p>Reports arising out of any public consultation process, and any Regulatory Impact Assessment, carried out will be published by my Department.  All measures in relation to levies and bans provided for in regulations subsequent to the enactment of the Bill will undergo Regulatory Impact Assessments, including SME Tests, where applicable.</p></reply>

In 2020, the ESRI estimated that 17.5% of households in Ireland could be at risk of energy poverty. Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of energy poverty when energy prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their energy needs increases.   The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. Recognising the unprecedented rise in energy prices facing people the Government put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year including:</p>  <p>  -an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March.</p>  <p>-   the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT) credited to domestic electricity accounts.</p>  <p>  -specific measures in the new National Retrofit Schemes to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation.</p>  <p>  To further manage the impact of recent price increases the Government, in the recently published National Energy Security Framework, announced a number of additional measures for households and businesses including:</p>  <p>  -A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.</p>  <p>  -A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.</p>  <p>-   A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.</p>  <p>  -The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.</p>  <p>  -A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.</p>  <p>-   An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  -The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, electricity and gas suppliers, which are overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.</p>  <p>  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The Group consists of representatives from my Department, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has commenced examination of the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland. The main goal is to provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable households. A work programme, proposed outputs and timelines will be agreed and finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in the coming weeks to inform future policy in this area.</p></reply>

In addition, I participate in meetings of the International Energy Agency, who have agreed upon several co-ordinated release of strategic oil reserves.</p>  <p>  The crisis in Ukraine has brought into sharp focus the EU's and Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on fossil fuel imports. We must continue to accelerate the clean energy transition, focussing on energy efficiency and renewable energies. The European Commission&rsquo;s RePowerEU Communication of 18 May 2022 sets out measures to end dependence on Russian energy including: saving energy, diversifying supplies away from Russia, substituting fossil fuels by accelerating Europe&rsquo;s clean energy transition, removing financial and regulatory barriers to rolling out needed infrastructure, and ensuring Member States have contingency plans to deal with any disruption in supplies from Russia.</p>  <p>  The National Energy Security Framework, published in April 2022, provides a single overarching and initial response to address Ireland&rsquo;s energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine. It coordinates work connected to energy security across the electricity, gas and oil sectors and sets out a &lsquo;Whole-of Government&rsquo; response to the challenges posed to energy security and energy affordability.</p></reply>

The review is considering the risks to both natural gas and electricity supplies, and a range of measures, including the need for additional capacity to import energy, energy storage, fuel diversification and renewable gases (such as hydrogen).    The underpinning analysis is now being updated to, amongst other things, reflect changing circumstances following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. </p>  <p>  The Policy Statement on importing fracked gas was approved by Government and published in May 2021. The policy statement provides that, pending the outcome of a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems that is currently being carried out by the Department, it would not be appropriate for the development of any LNG terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with. In line with this policy statement, the potential role of LNG is one option being considered, along with other potential options, as part of the review.  </p></reply>

Budget 2022 allocated &euro;368 million &ndash; an increase of 17% over 2021 &ndash; for Energy Transformation. This includes &euro;202 million from carbon tax revenue for residential and community retrofit schemes (over 22,000 home energy upgrades in total). More than half of the funding will be for free upgrades for low-income households at risk of energy poverty. </p>  <p>  However, new regulations are also necessary as each year some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning. It is estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution.</p>  <p>  Throughout the course of three different forms of public consultation, undertaken over the past 18 months, the direction of travel has been made clear. To address this public health and environmental crisis, new solid fuel regulations will be introduced across a range of fuels to ensure that the most polluting will no longer be available for general sale on the Irish market and that as particulate matter comes from burning not only bituminous coal but other solid fuels, that we must now regulate to improve the standards of all fuels available on our market.  </p>  <p>  Government has been equally clear that turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatlands and that measures are required to reduce the emissions associated with burning peat, but which respect these traditions. </p>  <p>  The regulations which will ultimately be agreed by Government will ensure, that while measures are introduced to enhance the quality of our air, they will not impinge upon traditional local practices associated with sod peat. .</p></reply>

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. More information is available here: <i>www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CRU21131-Interim-Clean-Export-Guarantee-Decision-Paper.pdf</i>. Micro-generators who wish to become eligible should register for an export grid connection from ESB Networks (Micro-Generators (esbnetworks.ie)) and have a smart meter where applicable (Smart Meter Upgrade FAQs (<i>esbnetworks.ie</i>)).</p><p>  Over 29,000 micro- and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and 20,000 of this cohort have smart meters which means they are already accruing the value of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff for their exported electricity, and payments will be backdated to the date of eligibility or the 15th February 2022, whichever is the latest.</p><p>  The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Once eligible, customers can expect an initial payment or credit from their suppliers from 1 July depending on billing cycle. The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision to their customers on when initial Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payments will be made at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>  The CRU encourages customers to contact their supplier to obtain information on their suppliers' CEG tariff arrangements.</p></reply>

The map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State led Intervention, under the contract signed with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).  </p><p>The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p><p>According to the most recent information available to my Department there are 2,459,983 premises in Ireland. Some 77% of these premises can avail of high-speed broadband from commercial operators. High-speed broadband is defined as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The remaining 23% will have high-speed broadband made available to them through the National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention ensuring that no premises is left behind regardless of their location.</p><p>In terms of the NBP State led intervention, the NBP roll out is a 7-year plan under the contract and deployment is due to be complete by the end of 2026.  I am advised by NBI that as of 20 May 2022, over 327,600 premises have now been surveyed and over 175,300 premises are under construction or complete across 26 counties, demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. I am further advised that almost 67,700 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties, with over 56,600 premises passed across 22 counties and available for immediate connection. </p><p>NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas in all 26 counties, including the status of the Deployment Areas located in Cavan and Monaghan. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 20 May 2022, 584 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. Further details can be found at <i>nbi.ie/broadband-connection-points/</i>. </p><p>My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at https://nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

To meet our climate objective to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, we must reduce GHG emissions across all sectors while enhancing our management of the LULUCF sector to optimise options for carbon sequestration.</p><p>  The LULUCF sector consists of the following categories: forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other land and harvested wood products. It is currently the only sector which has the potential to sequester CO<sub>2</sub>. In 2015, the EU LULUCF sector reported a net carbon sink of about 309 Mt CO2-eq. This was dominated by CO2 sequestered by existing and new forests. In contrast, Ireland is currently a net emitter of greenhouse gasses (GHG) from the LULUCF sector.</p><p>  This is largely due to the GHG emissions from grasslands and wetlands, resulting from drainage of organic soils, being greater than the sink from forest land and harvested wood products. All our LULUCF categories have the potential to be managed as net sinks for GHG.</p><p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 set out a range of LULUCF policies and measures which will establish a pathway for this sector to become a sustainable net sink in the long-term, supporting our transition to a carbon neutral economy and society no later than 2050. Actions to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s net LULUCF emissions include:</p><p>- Increasing our annual afforestation rates and promoting forest management initiatives to increase carbon sinks and stores. </p><p>- Reducing management intensity (water table management) of grasslands on drained organic soils.</p><p>- Improving the management grasslands on mineral soils for carbon sequestration.</p><p>- Increasing the inclusion of cover crops in tillage and increasing the incorporation of straw to at least 10% of the tillage (cereal) area.</p><p>- Rehabilitating 65,000 hectares of peatlands across numerous landowners and projects.</p></reply>

Furthermore, my Department is working across all of Government, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on the need to address our carbon emissions. My Department consults with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on a number of policy matters, including for strategic policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Strategic Plan, and Food Vision 2030. </p>  <p>  Presently my Department, is working across Government on sectoral emissions ceilings as required by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. This shall set the emission limits for all sectors of our economy over the next two Carbon Budget periods. </p>  <p>  Climate Action Plan 2021 sets out an ambitious emissions reduction range for the agriculture sector of between 22% and 30% by 2030, compared with a 2018 baseline. The achievement of this target will require significant innovation and effort, representing a transformative change for our agri-food industries. I am confident that the sector will fully exploit the opportunities of the transition without compromising on sustainable food production.</p>  <p>  To address emissions in manufacturing my Department is engaging with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the sectoral emissions ceiling for industry which includes the agri-food sector. Together we are reviewing the measures agreed in the Climate Action Plan 2021 to ensure that they can deliver the emissions reductions required. To meet requirements such as technical feasibility and cost effectiveness and their wider economic impact. </p></reply>

Gas prices are now unprecedently high, which feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas. Government is acutely aware of the impacts these rising prices will have on consumers, in particular the most vulnerable. Following the Budget 2022 package which introduced a number of supports for households, the Government announced in February a &euro;505 million suite of measures to mitigate the cost of living increases including a credit payment to all households of &euro;176.22 excluding VAT and an additional Fuel Allowance lump sum of &euro;125.</p><p>In April, the Government also published the National Energy Security Framework which details consumer supports and protections that are already in place and that are being enhanced including:- a further &euro;100 Fuel Allowance lump sum payment</p><p>- a new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons </p><p>- a reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.</p><p>As part of its statutory role, Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), the independent regulator has consumer protection functions and monitors energy retail markets to ensure that competition continues to develop and for the benefit of the consumer. Response 6 of the Framework charges the CRU with implementing a package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt by quarter 3 - ahead of the next heating season. As also set out in the Framework, work is ongoing to consider additional measures to help consumers meet the cost of energy taking into account available resources. </p></reply>

I am further advised that almost 67,700 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties, with over 56,600 premises passed across 22 counties and available for immediate connection. </p><p>NBI has advised that there are over 3,600 premises passed and available for connection in County Cavan and almost 4,400 premises passed in County Monaghan. Further details are available on specific areas within Cavan and Monaghan through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. </p><p>NBI has made recent improvements to its website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas in all 26 counties, including the status of the Deployment Areas located in Cavan and Monaghan. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: <i>www.nbi.ie</i>. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 20 May 2022, 584 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cavan, 12 BCP sites have been installed to date, with 15 sites installed in County Monaghan. Further details can be found at <i>nbi.ie/broadband-connection-points/</i>. </p><p>In County Cavan, some 13 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access, with 11 now installed in County Monaghan. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at <i>nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</i>.</p><p>My Department has worked with NBI to agree an Updated Interim Remedial Plan (UIRP) which recalibrated the targets for 2022 to take account of the knock on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the programme. The revised target is 102,000 premises passed by the end of January 2023 (cumulative).  It remains the ambition of the Government to roll out the National Broadband Plan State led intervention as quickly as possible in all areas, including Cavan and Monaghan, and to achieve this NBI will continue its focus on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p></reply>

Specifically, the targets for digital connectivity include that all Irish households and business will be covered by a Gigabit network by 2028 and all populated areas covered by 5G by 2030.     </p>  <p>  The roll-out of infrastructure for mobile telecommunications services in Ireland is primarily a matter for private mobile network operators, operating on a commercial basis with mobile coverage obligations set out in licences granted by the independent regulator, ComReg who advise that the current minimum coverage obligations in those licences are being considerably exceeded by all operators.    </p>  <p>  ComReg is planning another Multi-band Spectrum Award to assign rights of use in four spectrum bands which will enable the market to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data. To assist consumers to choose the network provider that best meets their needs, ComReg has developed a national outdoor coverage map. This map which is available on the ComReg website provides consumers with very clear information on where operators have good 2G, 3G and 4G coverage. The Department liaises regularly with both ComReg and operators to ensure progress in the provision of mobile coverage across the country.    </p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Community and Rural Development continues to tackle issues impeding the rollout of mobile and fixed connectivity including how best outdoor mobile phone coverage can be further improved and ensuring the efficient use of infrastructure and assets to support the rollout of telecoms networks into the future.</p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as neighbourhood or residential charging, destination charging, and motorway charging. </p><p>The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand.  </p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles -  Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at <i>esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades</i>. </p><p>The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and has announced through the draft EV Charging Infrastructure Strategy a number of additional actions to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the de-carbonisation effort.</p><p>My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.  <b></b></p><p>While the public consultation regarding the charging infrastructure strategy is ongoing, my Department continues to engage directly with stakeholders to ensure that a sufficient number of chargers, as well as a sufficient spread of charger types, will be in place to meet demand as we move towards our 2030 target of circa 1 million EVs on the road. </p><p>All of the above actions will help us move towards not only our national targets, but towards alignment with our international targets and obligations for decarbonisation such as those set out by the European Union. </p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.</p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p>  <p>  The YAC was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings. </p>  <p>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th of April and nationwide from the 9th of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations. </p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to costings on the provision of free transport for all school children, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

This is designed in such a way as to provide a larger increase for premium hours (20.00 to 08.00, Sundays and Bank Holidays) and shorter journeys. This is the period, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights, when there are the most complaints about the unavailability of taxis. It is hoped that increasing taxi fares, particularly the premium fare, will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during that time, as well as making the sector more attractive to new entrants, thus increasing availability to passengers nationally.</p>  <p>  The 2022 driver survey, undertaken by the NTA, shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently work this period. 30% of drivers (up from 17% in 2019) reported that they would consider working these hours if fares were to increase for this &ldquo;night work&rdquo;.   In recognition of this, the proposed fare has been weighted in favour of the Premium Rate period.  The increase in cents/euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial; however, the cumulative impact of the increase is significant for drivers and it is hoped that this will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during these periods and also encourage drivers to reactivate their licences.</p>  <p>  My Department and the NTA introduced a number of supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licenced SPSVs to continue in the industry during this very difficult period. These included an increase in the maximum vehicle age, and licence fees at no cost. The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period. It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licences will return now that demand for services is increasing.</p>  <p>  The SPSV Motor Tax Refund Scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the SPSV industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. and I provided &euro;2m in funding for this Scheme. The Scheme commenced on 1 September 2021 following NTA&rsquo;s extensive efforts to put in place the necessary process to ensure SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax. The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022.  </p>  <p>  The NTA also introduced the NCT Initial Test Fee Waiver Scheme for the SPSV sector on September 1st 2021, with funding of &euro;1.5m from my Department.  As a result, SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free.  This Scheme also ends on 31 August 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department has made available funding to the NTA to provide grants for the provision and conversion of vehicles to being wheelchair accessible which is a requirement for new entrants to the SPSV industry.  The uptake of the Wheelchair Accessible Taxi (WAT) grant scheme has been strong, with 3,341 grants allocated for the purchase of a WAT between 2014 and 2021, with associated funding of over &euro;3 million given over that period.   </p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use.  The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by the NTA. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric. The Scheme is kept under continuous review and is currently paused to allow for the drawdown and payment of provisional grant offers. Once these grant offers have been drawn down, there will be a clearer picture of the funding available for the second half of the year and, at this stage, I anticipate the scheme will reopen for applications in the summer, allowing SPSV operators to again apply for the supports on offer.  </p></reply>

Additionally, short stay accommodation provided through on-line platform operators, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, is generally treated as trading income rather than rental income. As such, it is aggregated with other trading income and, therefore, it is not possible to provide the information requested in relation to short-term rental accommodation. </p><p>In relation to longer term rental income, I am further advised by Revenue that, while it is possible to identify the rental income returned, the final tax liability of persons in receipt of such income takes account of a combination of all incomes, reliefs, credits, and deductions available to the taxpayer. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the exact tax liability associated with rental income.</p><p>The table below sets out the gross income, rental income and total tax paid on all income for those taxpayers who declared residential rental income on their returns for the years 2016 to 2019 (the latest year for which fully analysed data is currently available). <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Gross Income &euro;bn</th>       <th>Residential Rental Income &euro;bn</th>       <th>Income Tax Paid &euro;bn</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>15.4</td>       <td>3.2</td>       <td>3.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>14.8</td>       <td>3.0</td>       <td>3.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>14.1</td>       <td>2.8</td>       <td>3.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>12.9</td>       <td>2.6</td>       <td>2.8</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The table below provides the same information in respect of the subset of taxpayers with one residential rental property. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Gross Income &euro;bn</th>       <th>Residential Rental Income &euro;bn</th>       <th>Income Tax Paid &euro;bn</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>6.7</td>       <td>1.1</td>       <td>1.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>6.4</td>       <td>1.0</td>       <td>1.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>5.9</td>       <td>0.9</td>       <td>1.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>5.2</td>       <td>0.8</td>       <td>1.3</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>At present I have no plans to introduce a relief along the lines of that outlined by the Deputy.</p><p>As indicated to the Deputy in my reply to his question no. 82 dated 1 June 2022, proposals for any new tax reliefs must be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p><p>Finally, on the question of the tax treatment of rental income generally, and as I also mentioned in my reply the Deputy's question no. 82 yesterday, under the Housing for All strategy, my Department is committed to review the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers (2017) by Q3 2022. This work is in hand and I look forward to the outcome of the review in due course.</p></reply>

Some of the main features of the current regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base. Changing the tax rate (or imposing additional levies on certain sectors) could have unforeseen consequences. There is a risk of such taxes leading to higher consumer costs and negative impacts on investment in the energy sector, in particular in the area of renewables.</p>  <p>  Proposals for a windfall tax must take into account wider energy policy, under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. A well-functioning EU electricity market is crucial for the integration of our Internal Energy Market and supporting investment in new renewables. The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term.</p>  <p>  The complexities of the energy market and the range of producers and contracts must also be taken into account. For example, the Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) contains strong consumer protection measures, with wholesale market revenues above the auction price returned to electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation Levy.</p>  <p>  As noted in the previous discussion cited by the Deputy, these are all important matters for consideration by the Government when looking at the wider context for energy taxation proposals.  In this regard, the Government approved and published the National Energy Security Framework on the 13th April. The Framework sets out that the Government will work with the European Commission and other Member States to consider the policy proposals outlined under REPowerEU, designed to aid consumers and businesses to deal with increasing energy costs. REPowerEU is a joint European action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy.  The European Commission published the REPowerEU Plan on 18 May and analysis of these proposals is currently being undertaken. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the burden on consumers in relation to the cost of energy. This includes providing &euro;200 worth of energy credit to every household in the country; reductions in fuel excise duty; and a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas.</p></reply>

In such instances, Article 15(3) of the OECD Model Tax Convention provides that two jurisdictions may agree that remuneration which is derived from an employment exercised aboard a ship operated in international traffic is taxable in the country in which the place of effective management of the operator of the ship is located.  </p><p>For example, an international seafarer who is resident and domiciled for Irish tax purposes will be subject to Irish income tax on his/her worldwide income, including that derived from the exercise of an employment on board a ship in international waters. If the seafarer is subject to tax on this income in another jurisdiction with which the State has a DTA, then the income may be relieved from double taxation in accordance with the terms of the DTA. </p></reply>

These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August, 2021.</p>  <p>  The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>  Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision. The deadline for submission of capital appeals was Monday 4 April and 146 appeals were received.

Now that the appeal process is complete, my Department will also undertake a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete. </p></reply>

However, this information may be available or requested from each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  Since 2013, Exchequer funding has been provided through my Department's Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme (EERP) to support local authorities with the retrofit of local authority owned homes requiring insulation and energy upgrade works. Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme.</p>  <p>  In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding being made available for insulation, windows and doors and heating upgrades, specifically the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works. The installation of gas/oil boilers are no longer supported under the energy efficiency programme funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  The 2021 EERP provided funding for the installation of 604 heat pumps, while the Midlands Retrofit Pilot allowed for the installation of heat pumps on all 146 properties. The funding available for the installation of a heat pump last year was &euro;13,000. This has been increased to &euro;16,000 for the 2022 programme.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department announced that funding of &euro;85 million will be provided for the upgrade of approximately 2,400 social homes in 2022. Each local authority received an individual allocation along with a minimum target of homes they are required to retrofit. The programme has been devised in a way to give local authorities a level of flexibility when selecting properties to retrofit ranging from those requiring minor levels of works to properties needing the maximum level of retrofitting required to bring them to a B2/cost Optimum standard. </p>  <p>  Under the 2022 EERP, my Department funds costs of up to &euro;48,850, plus project management fees, on individual local authority homes. The actual cost of retrofitting works on each home will depend on its pre-works BER but can be as low as &euro;16,350 in some cases. Targets set and funding allocated to local authorities under the new programme calls for local authorities to undertake retrofitting on a variety of house types, from those requiring minimal investment to those requiring major investment, in order to achieve the B2/Cost Optimal BER. Local authorities are asked to ensure that the average cost per home drawn down under the programme is circa &euro;36,000, including project management fees. Adhering to this average will ensure that the maximum number of homes can be retrofitted with the available budget.  </p>  <p>  Work in relation to the 2022 programme is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department. Full details in relation to the 2022 EERP will be available early in 2023.</p></reply>

Since then Waterways Ireland has developed and maintained facilities for boats at a number of key locations including a significant marina development at Cleighran More and harbour facilities at Spenser Harbour.</p><p>Waterways Ireland has received planning approval for the development of a boat slipway at Spenser Harbour, which will complement and augment the harbour as a boating amenity and will provide much needed access to that area of Lough Allen.</p><p>At the same time, Waterways Ireland in association with Leitrim County Council has developed the Shannon Blueway utilising the Lough Allen Canal and the wider north Shannon area. The Blueway development is bringing increasing numbers of visitors to the canal and to the wider area in general. </p><p>With regard to the proposal referred to in the Question, Waterways Ireland does not have immediate plans to progress this proposal. </p><p>Waterways Ireland has together with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the 10 Local Authorities, including Cavan and Leitrim, formulated and is currently implementing the Shannon Tourism Masterplan. The formulation of the Masterplan is the first time a dedicated plan has been undertaken on the Shannon Region. Based on three core themes, seven strategic signature initiatives are proposed that will, when delivered; position the Shannon Region as a distinctive and sustainable tourist destination.  The initiatives are as follows:</p><p>1.Communicating a clear and consistent message;</p><p>2. Enhancing the on-water experience;</p><p>3. Enhancing the waterside experience;</p><p>4. Animating and enhancing the Shannon towns and villages;</p><p>5. Protecting and enhancing the Shannon Environment;</p><p>6. Improving connectivity; and</p><p>7. Building networks.</p><p>The potential restoration of disused navigations for recreational purposes including their expanded and wider use forms part of Strategic Signature Initiative 3 (Enhancing the on-water experience).</p></reply>

There is a robust process in place to ensure the data provided by local authorities is accurate.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-02a.613.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022060200069#WRM03000"><p>In October 2021, the Passport Service established a temporary phone line to respond to Oireachtas Members' queries on urgent passport cases.</p><p>I am aware that many Deputies are receiving a large number of passport queries from constituents due to the continued high demand for passports. Since last week, the number of staff on the Oireachtas Urgent Query Service team has increased from seven to eleven full time staff. As of last week, up to 20 queries per week from each Oireachtas Member can be facilitated by this team.</p><p>Staff on the Oireachtas Line continue to work productively under increasing pressure. They are dealing with record numbers of calls and queries every week and have handled over 12,200 queries from Members since the beginning of this year. </p><p>In each case raised by an Oireachtas Member, the Passport Service reviews the application in question. However, applications can only be expedited in cases of genuine emergency such as a need for urgent medical treatment overseas or the death of a family member abroad. Such applications are expedited through the Travel Emergency service.</p><p>Non-urgent cases should continue to be dealt with through the existing phone lines and web chat facilities. Passport applications that are being processed in line with their turnaround times cannot be expedited. Where the estimated issue-by date has been exceeded this will result in a query being raised internally in the Passport Service. The Passport Service will work to issue a passport or respond to a request for further information to the customer within two working days.</p><p>While Deputies often hear of the most complex and pressing cases, the overwhelming majority of passport applicants have their passport processed without any recourse to their local TD. </p><p>The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years. In 2019, which was the busiest year for passports pre-Covid, the Passport Service had issued 470,000 passports by the end of May. In the same time period this year, over 540,000 passports have been issued. In 2021, 634,000 passports were issued in the whole year. In five months the Passport Service has issued over 80% of the total number of passports that were issued in the whole of last year.</p><p>Passport applicants can track the status of their passport application online via the Passport Tracker which is available on my Department's website - <i>www.dfa.ie/passporttracking/</i>. The information on the tracker has recently been upgraded, and is an excellent guide as to where an application is in the system.</p><p>The Passport Service is a unified service composed of three constituent offices located in Lower Mount Street and Balbriggan in Dublin and South Mall in Cork, respectively. Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.</p><p>Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online and Passport Online is available to 97% of all applicants across the world. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.</p><p>Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.</p><p>The paper-based, mail-in &quot;Post Passport&quot; service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices. A paper-based, mail-in service is also available at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. The Passport Service continues to see a steady, but increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the postal application channel, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.</p><p>In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed over 5,000 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 0.9% of the total 540,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.</p><p>I am satisfied overall that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.</p><p>I would again encourage all those applying for passports to apply online well in advance of any planned travel.  The current processing times for passport applications are:</p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>- 30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online (applications received from 19 April)</p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Post Passport&quot; service.</p></reply>

EU-UK engagement on resolving outstanding issues under the Protocol is an ongoing process. The EU-UK Joint Committee met on 21 February and the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on 8 March.</p>  <p>  I maintain regular and ongoing contact with my UK counterparts, including the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. I have met with both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Foreign Secretary in recent weeks to discuss a range of issues, including the Protocol.</p>  <p>  In those meetings I expressed my deep disappointment at the British Government&rsquo;s intention to table legislation to unilaterally dis-apply elements of the Protocol. My message remains clear. I continue to urge the British Government against unilateral action and encourage constructive engagement with the EU. </p>  <p>  I have also remained in regular contact with the parties in Northern Ireland following last month&rsquo;s Assembly elections. I hope, as we all do, to see the early establishment of an Executive and will continue to encourage the parties to work together to achieve this. Work on formation of the Executive and on application of the Protocol should both proceed in parallel. In the period ahead, we will continue to engage with the political parties and the British Government, to support the full functioning of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  We have listened and take all sincerely held concerns about the Protocol seriously. The EU has also consistently engaged with the perspectives of everyone in Northern Ireland. In October, the Commission presented a package of proposals that responds directly to their concerns. These proposals would ease the flow of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and give Northern Ireland a greater say in the implementation of the Protocol. </p>  <p>  Only joint solutions can provide long-term legal certainty and predictability to people and businesses in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

I travelled to Belfast for meetings with the political parties on 11 May last. In addition, the Taoiseach travelled to Belfast on 20 May to meet with political parties and business leaders. Engagement is essential between the parties and between the Governments at this time. In our discussions with the political parties during these visits, the importance of forming an Executive as soon as possible was discussed, as well as issues in relation to the Protocol. </p>  <p>  This election has undoubtedly brought with it significant democratic change, which will need to be navigated in the period ahead. It is, first and foremost, a matter for the parties now, and those representatives that have been elected in good faith, to come together to establish an Executive that can deliver for all of the people of Northern Ireland on the basis of the result of the election, and in a spirit of partnership, equality and mutual respect.</p>  <p>  It is disappointing that it was not possible to elect an Assembly Speaker again on Monday.</p>  <p>  We will continue to engage with the parties and the British Government to support the full functioning of the democratic institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope, as we all do, that we will see those institutions up and running as soon as possible.

Officials from my Department have also engaged with victims groups, which is crucial.</p>  <p>  Lasting progress is best achieved through finding an agreed way forward based on engagement and sufficient consensus. We already had the basis for that in the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  In addition to concerns about the process, we have a number of serious concerns about the substantive provisions of the Bill. These include the powers of the Commission, the status of the &lsquo;reviews&rsquo; proposed in the Bill, and of course, fundamentally, compliance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and other international human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  I know that many families are upset by the publication and progress of this Bill, including those waiting for inquests or pursuing civil litigation. There will be many that understandably feel that immunity, conditional or otherwise, may be more about protecting perpetrators instead of pursuing justice and getting to the truth in such cases. It is vital that those concerns are heard and fully understood. It is also vital that the process for dealing with the legacy build rather than erode trust and confidence. </p>  <p>  I wholeheartedly welcome the contributions from members in last week's debate in this chamber.</p>  <p>  We will continue to engage with the UK Government, at all levels, to better understand the provisions of this bill.  I have serious concerns and cannot support it in its current form.</p></reply>

Existing capabilites available to the Army include radar systems such as the Giraffe Mk4 short-range air defence system and the Foxtrack X-Band ground surveillance radar. The Air Corps use surface search radar on the CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft and all aircraft are fitted with a transponder and the automatic identification system (AIS) for identification and tracking. The Naval Service use maritime surface search radar and the Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) systems for surveillance and tracking. </p>  <p>  It remains Government policy, as per the 2015 White Paper on Defence, that should additional funding, beyond that provided for in existing plans, become available the development of a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps, will be considered.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompassed the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces. The Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces contains many detailed recommendations and there is a process underway to consider these recommendations.  This includes inter-departmental consultation as appropriate.  The intent remains to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess. It would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt this deliberative process in advance of Government consideration.</p>  <p>  In this context, the specific matter you have raised has not been explored in relation to existing Defence Forces capabilities and such exploration has not been required. Should a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps be progressed via Government Decision then the appropriate research and preparatory work will be undertaken as is the case in relation to all Defence Forces major procurement projects.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p><p>The costs from 2011 &ndash; 2020 for transporting children on a daily basis to primary and post primary schools including children with special educational needs throughout the country is as follows; <table>    <tr>       <th>2011 </th>       <th>2012 </th>       <th>2013 </th>       <th>2014 </th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;171,482,638 </td>       <td>&euro;168,463,923 </td>       <td>&euro;170,749,769 </td>       <td>&euro;172,080,676 </td>       <td>&euro;172,961,930 </td>       <td>&euro;182,187,931 </td>       <td>&euro;188,534,596 </td>       <td>&euro;200,275,020 </td>       <td>&euro;219,200,274 </td>       <td>&euro;224,780,076 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The average cost of providing transport for a child to a primary or post-primary school is estimated at &euro;1,000 per annum.  The average cost to provide transport for a child who requires Special Educational Needs transport is estimated at &euro;9,000 per annum.  </p><p>In 2021, receipts from school transport charges amounted to approximately &euro;12m (net of refunds issued arising from Covid related school closures).  If school transport fees were to be abolished and eligibility criteria remained the same, the cost of providing free transport to each child availing of school transport would be approximately an additional cost of &euro;12m on the total cost of transport for the year. This figure is based on current patterns of school transport uptake and could vary depending on eligibility and demand.</p><p>School Transport is a demand led scheme and services are planned annually based on the number of eligible pupils who apply and pay on time. The closing date for receipt of payment for school transport for the 2022/23 school year is 29th July 2022.  The final number of children to be accommodated on school transport services for the 2022/23 school year will not be known until after this date.</p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website <i>www.energyineducation.ie</i>. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  </p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan. </p><p>The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems at a total budget cost of &euro;28M. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p><p>The Department recognises that transition to full decarbonisation raises the bar even higher in terms of requirements with feedback from our pathfinder projects as noted above indicating a greater depth of challenges at a significantly enhanced cost for primary and post primary schools. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 Annex of Actions published this year actions the Department to confirm its decarbonisation pathway trajectory to meet 2030 and 2050 targets for the schools sector by end of 2022.</p><p>Work is ongoing on decarbonisation options for new schools with a focus on the standard of required design criteria and specification to achieve a net zero energy school building and establishing the trajectory for the integration of suitable solutions on a phased basis in a risk controlled manner providing a credible cost effective transition to zero carbon school buildings while ensuring no delays to school accommodation delivery.</p></reply>

programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,506 schools and organisations benefitting 230,000 children.  The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.  </p><p>A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the programme in 2022.  The allocation for the school meals programme was increased substantially over a series of budgets - increasing from &euro;35million in 2012 to &euro;68.1 million in 2022 (almost 95% of an increase).  The amount of school meals funding that has been provided for the past five school years by county is provided in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>I am committed to continuing to grow the school meals programme and in particular the hot school meals element of the programme, building further on the significant extension announced as part of Budget 2022.  In this regard, I have commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme to be undertaken in 2022 to inform future policy decisions on the scheme.</p><p>This evaluation will assess all aspects of the provision of school meals and will engage with all stakeholders.  This evaluation will consider:</p><p>- The extent to which the school meals programme has improved school attendance and educational achievement/outcomes. </p><p>- The extent to which the school meals programme has alleviated food poverty and/or improved deprivation measures among families of children who benefit from the programme. </p><p>- Whether or not the current method of targeting the programme vis the DEIS categorisation is effective/the implications for the outcomes measured in (a) and (b) of extending the scheme to non-DEIS schools. </p><p>- Whether the current school meal programme is effective.</p><p>- How the scheme compares with programmes in peer states.</p><p>- Identify gaps and recommend changes to the current programme and propose a design for an effective impact evaluation of the school meals programme.</p><p>- Implications of the EU Child Guarantee for the SMP.</p><p>The evaluation is due for completion in November 2022.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position

Generally where CE schemes close, every effort is made to maintain services through amalgamation with other schemes with employment maintained for CE supervisors and places protected for participants.  This minimises the need for redundancy, but where a redundancy arises, it is an issue for the employer to resolve. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. Nurturing Skills sets out actions to achieve workforce commitments in First 5, the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families.</p><p>Early years educators, school-age childcare practitioners and childminders play a key role in supporting children&rsquo;s development and well-being, working in partnership with families. Recognising their central importance for the quality of provision, Nurturing Skills aims to support the professional development of the workforce and raise the profile of careers in the sector. </p><p>Commitments in Nurturing Skills are organised under five &quot;pillars&quot;: </p><p>- Establishing a career framework;</p><p>- Raising qualification levels; </p><p>- Developing a national Continuing Professional Development system; </p><p>- Supporting recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce; and</p><p>- Moving towards regulation of the profession.</p><p>Nurturing Skills has a wide range of commitments and, though there will not be a single financial package covering all actions within Nurturing Skills, many of the actions to be undertaken between now and 2028 will have financial implications. </p><p>One of the &quot;key enablers&quot; for workforce-related actions that is identified in Nurturing Skills is improvement in pay and conditions of employment for staff. In Budget 2022, I announced a new Core Funding scheme which will provide an additional &euro;73 million of funding in 2022 and is equivalent to more than &euro;221 million in a full year. Core Funding is expected, among other objectives, to support an Employment Regulation Order that may arise from the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, improving workforce recruitment and retention through improvement in pay and conditions.</p><p>A Monitoring Committee is being established with the task of monitoring the implementation of Nurturing Skills. A comprehensive Implementation Plan is included within Nurturing Skills and covers the first phase of implementation from 2022-2024.</p></reply>

Tackling this issue contributes to equality and makes good business sense, as firms that can report a low or non-existent gender pay gap will have an advantage in recruiting and retaining employees. Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can also be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government included a commitment to legislate to require publication of the gender pay gap in companies. The Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021 which has now come into force aims to provide transparency on the gender pay gap and incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. </p>  <p>  Under Regulations implementing the Act, organisations are asked to select a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; date in the month of June 2022 and those organisations having not less than 250 employees on that date will then have six months to prepare their calculations before reporting six months later, during December 2022. The Regulations also require employers to publish a statement setting out, in the employers&rsquo; opinion, the reasons for the gender pay gap in their company and what measures are being taken or proposed to be taken by the employer to eliminate or reduce that pay gap. My Department has issued guidance to employers on calculating their gender pay gaps. It is also continuing to engage with trade union and employer representative bodies in regard to the gender pay gap. Plans are also in place to develop an online reporting system for the 2023 reporting cycle.</p></reply>

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter, which will then be considered by my Department.</p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and the provisions in relation foster care will form part of this review.</p></reply>

The Strategy provides a framework for a range of actions to support migrants to participate fully in Irish life. While initially due to conclude in 2020, the Migrant Integration Strategy was extended to the end of 2021 in recognition of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation.</p>  <p>  My Department has commissioned a study to evaluate the processes for implementation of three equality strategies, which includes the Migrant Integration Strategy as well as the National Strategy for Women and Girls and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy. I anticipate that a consultation process to develop a new strategic policy for migrant integration will commence during 2022, with work to build the new Strategy taking place in 2023.</p>  <p>  As part of its actions under the Migrant Integration Strategy, my Department administers a number of funding programmes to support integration at both national and local level.</p>  <p>  One such initiative is the National Integration Fund, a three-year funding programme to promote projects that address areas where migrants find it difficult to avail of opportunities on an equal basis with other members of Irish society. Following a competitive funding call launched in August 2020, 18 successful projects located throughout Ireland were granted funding totalling almost &euro;2.2 million over the three year period. This funding will support national organisations and larger-scale initiatives to empower new members of Irish society to play an active part in their communities.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Communities Integration Fund, which has been in place since 2017, provides small grants of up to &euro;5,000 to community organisations for initiatives to promote integration at local level. Since its inception, the Communities Integration Fund has supported over 490 projects with grant funding totalling &euro;2.76m. The 2022  funding call closed in April this year and an announcement on funding will be made shortly.</p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007. Every Government Department and every Agency plays a role in ensuring implementation of the UNCRPD.    </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation - each year moving forward on key reforms, through delivery of two whole-of-government national strategies - the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. This model involves obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments and requirements.</p>  <p>  Ireland submitted its Initial State Report on the implementation of the UNCRPD to the UN Committee in November 2021, following extensive consultation with persons with disabilities, disabled persons organisations, representative organisations, and families. My Department is currently awaiting a review date from the UN Committee to evaluate progress made to date.</p>  <p>  My Department coordinates two major national strategies, which aim to address the needs of people with disabilities in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Firstly, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), contains 123 actions to support effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the UNCRPD, including in relation to children and women with disabilities. Implementation of the NDIS is monitored in regular NDIS Steering Group meetings through a reporting system which requires Government Departments and Agencies to detail their progress biannually. The group is supported by independent analysis and advice from the National Disability Authority (NDA).    </p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), is the primary disability employment policy initiative in Ireland. It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to the employment of persons with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide coordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers. Implementation of the CES is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson. </p>  <p>  Efforts are also underway to address the specific needs of people with autism. Last year, on World Autism Day, I announced my intention to develop an Autism Innovation Strategy. The Autism Innovation Strategy will identify key areas where individuals with autism face particular challenges and barriers, focusing on areas which may not be addressed by other national strategies. Once published, the Autism Innovation Strategy will utilise the key themes of innovation, empowerment and awareness raising to shape future policies and strategies to accelerate our journey towards being a more autism-inclusive and neurodiverse-friendly society.</p></reply>

This provides a forum for organisations to give information on national issues but also identify specific locations that require additional focus. A number of these national organisations provide a range of youth services in the Kildare area.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to all 16 Education and Training Boards (including Kildare/Wicklow ETB) to support youth services in their area. Youth Officers are supported to provide an important function for my Department in the co-ordination and administration of youth services at local level.

If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay. Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. </p>  <p>  Tusla recognise that the best way to improve outcomes for children is to intervene at an early stage to try to resolve problems and prevent harm. A way this can be done is by working with parents and communities to support children at the earliest possible stage. Consequently, Tusla, and its partner agencies, have undertaken a comprehensive suite of early intervention and preventative services. The aim of Tusla&rsquo;s Prevention Partnership &amp;amp; Family Support (PPFS) Service is to prevent risks to children and young people arising or escalating through early intervention and family support. </p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015 places a number of statutory obligations on specific groups of professionals and on particular organisations providing services to children. Additionally the Children&rsquo;s First Guidance 2017 includes information on the statutory obligations for those individuals and organisations under the Act. It also sets out the best practice procedures that should be in place for all organisations providing services to children. </p>  <p>  With regard to the safety of children in the care of the State, Tusla is committed to promoting safe practice in all areas of alternative care including residential care and foster care.  Safe practice is defined as the implementation of appropriate safeguarding measures necessary for working with young people in a manner that acknowledges their need to live in as normal an environment as possible. Regulations govern the placement of children in care.  These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. The Regulations also provide that the allocated social worker oversees the implementation of the child's  care plan, visits the child and consults with family members, foster carers and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.</p>  <p>  HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of children&rsquo;s services including Child Protection and Welfare Services, Foster Care Services, statutory Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres and Special Care units. HIQA carry out these inspections against Regulations and Standards, by reviewing files on site, interviews and questionnaires with staff and service users and their families. Following an inspection, HIQA share their initial judgements and draft report with the service/area. HIQA then works with the management of the centre or area in order to agree an Action Plan to address any identified deficits. Final reports are published, and are submitted to the Department with the area or service&rsquo;s Action Plans and are monitored as necessary by DCEDIY officials.</p>  <p>  It has been shown that the best environment for most children in care to thrive and reach their potential is best achieved within a foster care placement. Such placements also offer the child a loving and stable environment in which to live. Ireland can be proud of the fact that over 90% of all children in care, reside in foster care, a figure that compares favourably with our European neighbours. In some instances a child&rsquo;s needs are best met in Residential Care. Residential centres are typically domestic style homes where between 2 to 6 young people are being cared for. Young people in residential centres have an allocated a Key Worker, and their friends and family are free to visit in line with their care plan. Where possible these young people attend local schools and are supported to take part in local sporting and community activities. </p></reply>

Since then, the Government has set out a range of commitments in the Programme for Government to address this issue with a commitment to increase State spending to at least &euro;1bn by 2028.</p>  <p>  More than 100,000 children now avail of the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme (ECCE) programme, a universal two-year pre-school programme available free to all children within the eligible age range. It provides children with their first formal experience of early learning prior to commencing primary school. The programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week over 38 weeks per year and the programme year runs from September to June each year.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) provides financial support to help with childcare costs to more than 80,000 children. There are two types of subsidies available under the National Childcare Scheme:</p>  <p>  - Universal subsidies are available to all families with children under 3 years old. They are also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for ECCE. This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.   </p>  <p>  - Income Assessed Subsidies are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and will be calculated based on your individual circumstances. The rate will vary depending on family income, child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family. The maximum available income assessed subsidy, dependent on the aforementioned conditions, is &euro;5.10 per hour or a maximum weekly subsidy of &euro;229.50.</p>  <p>  A recent review of the NCS revealed that, as a proportion of total family childcare costs, 6% of parents receiving NCS support reported that all childcare costs were covered by the NCS, while 38% reported that half or more of their costs were covered by the NCS.</p>  <p>  Since the review took place, I announced a further package of measures to directly address the costs associated with childcare in Budget 2022, including:</p>  <p>  - an extension of the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15, benefitting up to 40,000 children from September this year.</p>  <p>  - an end to the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from spring 2022, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families since 2 May.</p>  <p>  - a new core funding scheme &ndash; worth &euro;221m in a full year &ndash; to support:</p>  <p>  1. improved quality through better pay and conditions for the workforce by supporting agreement on an ERO through the JLC;</p>  <p>  2. the employment of graduate staff; and</p>  <p>  3. improved sustainability and stability for services. </p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, educators and practitioners, and society overall.</p>  <p>  A new fee management system, attached to core funding,  will mean no increase in fees from pre-pandemic levels for the September 2022 to August 2023 programme year, which, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver significantly improved affordability for parents.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, I announced a number of changes to the Scheme as part of Budget 2022. These changes will be of significant benefit to many parents. </p>  <p>  For instance, from 2 May, the NCS no longer deducts hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours &ndash; benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. </p>  <p>  In September 2022, the NCS Universal subsidy will be extended to all children under 15 years of age.  This is worth 50 cents per hour, or over &euro;1,100 per annum for children in full time early learning and care.  The extension of the universal subsidy will benefit up to 40,000 children. </p>  <p>  Both of these changes will result in more parents getting additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare in Tusla registered services. </p>  <p>  Total funding under the NCS in 2022 is estimated to be &euro;200 million.  The NCS is demand lead so the total level of subsidy is dependent on the number of applications from parents, and the level of subsidy they are awarded. Funding for the NCS will increase over the coming three years, to improve the affordability of childcare for parents.  The amounts of NCS funding for each year will be set in the relevant Budgets. </p>  <p>  In addition to these improvements to the NCS, a core funding stream is being introduced in September 2022. The intention of this funding is to support providers to cover increased operating costs linked to quality improvement measures. A condition of this funding is that providers will not increase parents&rsquo; fees for early learning and childcare from September 2021 levels.  This will ensure that parents can fully benefit from NCS subsidies. Furthermore, to participate in core funding, providers will be required to offer the NCS and/or the ECCE programme to all eligible children/parents.  This will ensure that more families can access NCS subsidies.</p></reply>

In excess of 23,000 people have been referred to my Department for accommodation. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a significant role as part of the State&rsquo;s overall response, to support children and families displaced from Ukraine, as a result of the war and coming into Ireland. Tusla is committed to balancing the needs of families in a humanitarian crisis, with its child protection responsibilities, and requirement to support families and promote the welfare of children.</p>  <p>  Tusla has always been available to come to a port to assist immigration authorities where a separated child seeking international protection arrives in the State. Tusla has been advised that 88% of all Ukrainians are arriving in Ireland through Dublin Airport and has a Social Worker present at Dublin Airport providing a duty service from 10am until 2am the following day. The social worker will ensure all State authorities at the airport are aware of the referral process for child protection concerns and to assist with screening for indicators of potential child trafficking.</p>  <p>  Separated children seeking international protection who arrive at ports of entry to Ireland are referred to Tusla for a child protection needs assessment. Guidance regarding safeguarding and the immediate needs of children who have encountered trauma will be provided by the Tusla dedicated SCSIP Team and the broader Tusla child protection and foster care services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, on the issue of childcare, Ukrainian children are entitled to access the early childhood care and education, ECCE Programme, which provides two years of free preschool. The Early Years Division in my Department has taken responsibility for a number of actions supporting Ukrainian parents and children, allowing them to access preschool and ensuring children&rsquo;s well-being. These actions have included:</p>  <p>  - The development and translation of introductory information on the Irish early learning and care sector.</p>  <p>  - A capacity analysis across the country identified vacant preschool places and work is ongoing to match children to the vacant places and to create additional early childhood care and education, ECCE places, where possible, in high areas of demand.</p>  <p>  - Information on the access and inclusion model for children with disabilities accessing preschool has been translated into Ukrainian and Russian.</p>  <p>  In areas where there is pressure on ECCE services, my Department work with city and country childcare committees to identify what supply is available.</p>  <p>  With regard to supports for children, Tusla has compiled a list of 116 community contact centres across the country. These are local family support services which are either provided directly by Tusla or Tusla-funded services. That support for Ukrainian families in particular areas is available.</p></reply>

However, the post was not a teaching role and the duties included functions such as organising the programme of adult education for the area, identifying the need for adult education services and reviewing the existing provision.</p>  <p>  Under the PCW Pay Agreement, new entrants from 1996 to the AEO grade were assimilated to a new specific salary scale.  On assimilation to that scale AEOs appointed prior to the PCW Agreement could retain, on a personal basis, their existing annual leave and sick leave arrangements and were contracted to work a minimum of 30 hours per week.  Newly appointed AEOs were required to work the same weekly working hours as applied to administrative grades in VECs and had 29 days annual leave and general civil service sick leave entitlements. Their attendance was required during normal VEC office hours and at such other times as necessary for the delivery of the adult education service.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the qualification, experience and eligibility requirements appropriate to the post of the Adult Education Officer were revised to include having management experience at an appropriate senior level and having relevant experience in the leadership of teaching or learning or training in adult education or further education or training or community or voluntary sectors among other competencies. While no specific qualification is required, it is stated that a third level qualification in relevant discipline(s) commensurate with this role would be a decided advantage.</p></reply>

Consequently, Impact 2030: Ireland's Research and Innovation Strategy was published recently and positions research and innovation at the heart of addressing Ireland's societal, economic and environmental challenges.  </p>  <p>  Impact 2030 is structured around five pillars.</p>  <p>  - maximise the impact of research and innovation on the economy, society and the environment;</p>  <p>  - impact, evidence and evaluation will be central to the alignment of research and innovation activity with national needs</p>  <p>  - promote innovation driving enterprise success, particularly in the SME sector</p>  <p>  - ensure that talent is at the heart of the research and innovation research system</p>  <p>  - strengthening all- island, EU and global connectivity.  </p>  <p>  A wide-ranging consultation process informed development of the strategy, which included a public consultation process held in summer 2021. An online survey yielded 115 written submissions and an online stakeholder event and workshop attended by 120 participants from across Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;I system. A clear message arising from the consultation process was the need to position research and innovation at the heart of responding to national challenges. Another was the need to improve how the R&amp;I system itself works.  </p>  <p>  Arising from this context, a key initiative in Impact 2030 is to bring a landmark Research Bill to government to create a new competitive research and innovation funding agency, combining and building on the missions of the Irish Research Council and Science Foundation Ireland. The agency will not only support research across all disciplines, but it will enable greater interdisciplinary research activity in Ireland.

I was struck by its message of the common challenges facing systems North and South, and how the promotion of collaboration and shared practice is central to increasing opportunities for all on this island. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department has undertaken a series of measures to facilitate further the promotion of North-South  collaboration, not least the signing last year of the  Memorandum of Understanding on the Common Travel Area.  This ensured that student mobility would continue to be protected after Brexit, through continued access to SUSI loans and Home Fee tuition. </p>  <p>  I was also pleased to see SCoTENS and Universities Ireland referenced as positive forces for North South Collaboration. My Department funds both of these organisations, and their role has proved vital in the sharing of best practice, North and South, as the promotion of activities of mutual interest and benefit throughout the higher education system.  </p>  <p>  Reflective of this Government's commitment to maintain and enhance cross-border, the Taoiseach and I have collaborated closely through the Shared Island Unit on the North South Research Programme, in order to strengthen and formalise the commitment to research collaboration between Higher Education Institutes, which was mentioned in the report as being on &ldquo;somewhat of an ad-hoc basis.&rdquo; In March, we awarded a total of &euro;37.3 million  to fund collaborative research projects between academics and institutions in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The report also referenced Further Education, and I am very committed to the development of stronger North-South links in Further Education and Training  (FET), which continues to be a major focus for my Department under its Statement of Strategy.</p>  <p>  There is good co-operation which currently exists between Education and Training Boards, and the Regional Colleges in Northern Ireland, of which my Department and the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland are very supportive.  The North West Strategic Growth Partnership is an example of this, where Donegal ETB and the North West Regional College in Northern Ireland ensure their programme complement, rather than compete with each other to ensure the FET needs of that region are addressed.</p>  <p>  I also believe that there is further potential for strengthened collaboration in FET, through the forthcoming PEACE PLUS programme.  This new programme will look to support area-based approaches, designed to address skills gaps, which will result in increased productivity and employment and higher levels of cross-border labour mobility.</p></reply>

In cases where training is delivered in an Education and Training Board there is no contribution required from the apprentice.</p>  <p>  For craft apprenticeships, the ASC charged is typically one third of the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT. In the case of consortia-led apprenticeships the contribution varies for each programme as off-the-job training has a more flexible structure, ranging from periods of block release to one day per week or remote learning options.  </p>  <p>  Across both craft and consortia led apprenticeships, based on latest figures, if the ASC was removed, with the apprentice paying examination fees only, then the cost to the State is estimated at an average &euro;267 per apprentice per annum.  </p>  <p>  The 2021 year-end population of craft apprentices was 20,956 representing a potential annual cost to the Exchequer of &euro;5.6m, and 3,256 consortia-led apprentices representing a potential annual cost to the Exchequer of &euro;0.87m.</p></reply>

The Programme is broken into two bundles with Bundle 1 comprising six projects, currently at preferred tenderer stage and Bundle 2 comprising five projects, currently at competitive dialogue (pre-tender submission) stage. These projects will play an important role in enabling projected increases in student enrolments, addressing severe constraints with regard to existing infrastructure and advancing the TU agenda. The programme will deliver some 70,000m2 of additional space, generating an additional 8,000 student places, mainly in STEM-related areas.    </p>  <p>  The cost estimates in relation to the Higher Education PPP Programme were published on e-tenders as part of the contract notice in 2019 and 2020 for Bundle 1 and 2 respectively. Bundle 1 had an estimated construction value of &euro;150m (excluding VAT) whilst Bundle 2 had an estimated construction value of &euro;140m (excluding VAT). Since these figures were published, there has been significant inflation in the construction sector; the exact cost of each bundle will be finalised prior to contract signing and subject to a Value for Money assessment prior to contract signing.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all higher education PPP projects, the costs are reimbursed by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to the PPP Company, as part of the monthly Unitary Charge payments. These payments only commence once construction has been completed, the facilities are operational and continue over the 25 year period. </p></reply>

The Board operates 30 full time law centres and a number of part time law centres in Ireland. The Board also provides mediation services to help separating couples to negotiate their own agreement.</p><p>The majority of the Board's income consists of a grant received from my Department. This funding is used to provide the Board's services in all of its offices across the country, as well as to support services provided to law centres centrally from the Board's Head Office.</p><p>I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that it is not possible to extract and isolate the total cost of civil legal aid in any one office/county in a given year as it would be necessary to devise a basis on which to attribute (to each county or to each individual law centre) all expenditure incurred by the Board centrally. Complexities may also arise at local level with regard to the delivery of civil legal aid, for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply to Ennis Law Centre. Also, in a case where two parties to a dispute seek the services of the Legal Aid Board at one law centre, one party will be required to engage with a different law centre, which may be in a neighbouring county.</p><p>However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, the funding provided to the Legal Aid Board by my Department for the years 2019-2021 is provided in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Funding</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;40.8 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;42.2 million </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>&euro;44.6 million</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Regarding criminal legal aid, the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings. Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid. Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.</p><p>Statistics for criminal legal aid are also not compiled in such a manner as to readily identify expenditure on a county by county basis  <b>.</b></p><p>Expenditure on criminal legal aid in each of the years 2019 to 2021 is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Expenditure </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;65.1   million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;62.2   million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>&euro;73.4   million</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Forecasting arrivals is challenging as it is dependent upon many factors including the evolving situation in Ukraine and policy decisions by other closer countries.  </p>  <p>  A cross-departmental Daily Situation Report has been developed which includes information on take up of Medical Cards, etc. </p>  <p>  A Data Subgroup of the SOG is developing a geo-coded analysis of accommodation capacity and availability of public services including health services.  </p>  <p>  The responsibility of providing accommodation for refugees rests with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. The Department of Health and the HSE have submitted a list of potential properties to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is currently carrying out a review of medium to long-term housing options with regard to refugees. </p>  <p>  Community Response Forums have been established in every local authority, chaired by the Chief Executive, to coordinate the community-led response in the provision of assistance and support to Ukrainian refugees as they are accommodated around the country. Through the efforts of local volunteers, community workers, public bodies and private sector contributions many recent arrivals are being supported with basic needs including access to healthcare. </p>  <p>  A health service support model had been operational at Dublin Airport since the beginning of the crisis and includes the provision of generic health information, Covid safety packs, support with medical card queries, and the following core health supports: </p>  <p>  - Immediate medical assessment / provision of prescriptions for existing conditions.</p>  <p>  - Management of minor ailments and first aid requirements.</p>  <p>  - Identification of immediate complex health issues which require pathways into secondary acute or community services (e.g. cancer and disability services). </p>  <p>  From 23 May 2022, Citywest Convention Centre is functioning as the National Interagency Accommodation Transit and Processing Centre for those displaced by the war in Ukraine entering via Dublin Airport and Port. Accounting for approx. 85% of all arrivals. Services have ceased at Dublin Airport and the HSE will expand the service currently being delivered in Citywest to include supporting the completion of an individual health questionnaire/check by those transiting through the centre to identify health conditions which require ongoing therapeutic or medical intervention. </p>  <p>  The HSE has established a number of dedicated workstreams underpinning its national coordination efforts, including one which focuses on &lsquo;Disability Services&rsquo;.  This is chaired by the HSE Disability Specialist for Quality Improvement and meets weekly to provide updates from the National Coordination Group, identify challenges that organisations or CHOs are dealing with and develop solutions.     </p>  <p>  The HSE National Disability Operations Office is working with the Community Health Organisations, its funded disability service providers, and representative bodies, to manage and co-ordinate appropriate responses for children and adults with disabilities.</p>  <p>  HSE Disability Specialist for Quality Improvement meets with the Heads of Disability Services in each of the Community Health Organisation Areas weekly to ensure that a pathway for disability screening and assessment as Ukrainians arrive into Ireland is being undertaken &ndash; Ukrainians are then placed on the normal referral pathways for Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams, Primary Care Occupational Therapy for equipment, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, and Day Services. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Disability Operations are also coordinating the disability health response in conjunction with Disability Umbrella Groups and DCEDIY. </p>  <p>  An Information Pack is being finalised for families with disabilities and this will be available on www.hse.ie/ukraine under &ldquo;Disabilities&rdquo; &ndash; this information pack sign posts people with families to supports and services available to them. </p></reply>

In 2019, the PSC was updated and introduced a new project lifecycle, tightening the arrangements for project decision-making, and clarifying the roles of the parties involved including the responsibilities for Sponsoring Agencies and Approving Authorities. The PSC also provides detail on the business case requirements at each stage of the new project lifecycle.</p>  <p>  All capital development proposals must progress through several approval stages, in line with the new lifecycle approach of the updated PSC, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. </p>  <p>  The National Maternity Hospital (NMH) relocation project was initiated prior to the publication of the updated PSC, and therefore the NMH Project Board undertook additional work on the business case to ensure full compliance with the new PSC requirements.</p>  <p>  A Final business case for relocation of NMH has been submitted to the Department by the NMH Project Board for review at Gate 2 of the PSC. The Business Case is now subject to technical review by the Department of Health, including through the External Assurance Process recently introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  Pending favourable review under the Spending Code, a Memorandum for Government will then be brought forward to progress the programme for the NMH. If approval in principle is granted by Government, the project can move to deployment of a tendering strategy. </p>  <p>  In the interim, I have asked the Project Board to identify opportunities to accelerate or parallel certain activities related to the development of the project that can be undertaken without presupposing the outcome of the Government decision on the pre-tender final business case. The Project Board will take steps to ensure that it can act quickly to progress the project through the next stages, should approval in principle be granted.</p>  <p>  Based on the results of public procurement process, an updated Final Business Case will then be prepared by the NMH Project Board, seeking Government sanction for to proceed with the main capital project to construct the new NMH. </p>  <p>  The final decision to proceed with the construction and therefore to estimate the cost or key dates for the new NMH cannot be made until the tender process has been completed and the costings reviewed to ensure that the proposal delivers value for money and remains affordable.</p></reply>

It was chaired by the High Court judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan. The expert group examined the system from the perspective of the person who has made the claim to explore if there is a better way to deal effectively, yet more sensitively, with certain cases. </p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Meenan submitted the final report on the current system for managing clinical negligence claims to the then Minister for Health and Minister for Justice in January 2020, prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic. The Government subsequently published the Meenan report in December 2020. One of the report's recommendations is that a compensation scheme be established. </p>  <p>  On foot of a request from my Department, the Health Research Board, HRB, carried out an evidence review on the vaccine injury redress programme in other jurisdictions, which was completed in March 2019. The expert group's report, in addition to the HRB's evidence review, and consultation with other Departments and relevant State agencies will inform the development of proposals regarding the establishment of a compensation scheme, including the need for primary legislation. </p>  <p>  While some preliminary scoping work has been undertaken by the Department, during the Pandemic all available Department of Health resources were devoted to the Public Health response. This has meant that progress on the development of policy in this area could not be progressed as intended. </p>  <p>  There is still significant work required to develop proposals for consideration by Government regarding vaccine damage compensation. As part of that work, it is anticipated that consideration will also be given to the inclusion of claims relating to alleged adverse reactions from COVID Vaccines.</p></reply>

The number of registered pharmacists on the Register of Pharmacists held and maintained by the PSI has continued to grow steadily, with an average increase of 187 registrants each year over the past five years. As at 4 May 2022, 6848 pharmacists are currently registered with the PSI, under established processes based in Irish and EU law. </p>  <p>  I understand that currently there are reports of a current acute workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) has been liaising with stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue.  In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU. The PSI also circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support in efforts in understanding and addressing the issue in the short term, the results of which are pending. I understand that the IPU is seeking to establish a stakeholder group to examine the issue.</p>  <p>   In developing its Corporate Strategy 2021-2023, PSI was aware through its work and through reports from stakeholders, of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce, with a focus on community and hospital pharmacy, with a concern being that the issue might be exacerbated into the future. It is currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23, &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. In 2022, this project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The European Commission is also currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project. Support includes recommendations for health and social care workforce reforms.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of training places available for persons wishing to obtain the qualification to practise as a pharmacist, the pharmacist qualification is a PSI-accredited five-year fully integrated Master&rsquo;s degree programme in pharmacy (MPharm).  There are three Schools of Pharmacy within universities in Ireland &ndash; TCD, RCSI and UCC.  On successful completion of the five-year programme, graduates are then eligible to apply to the PSI for registration through the National Route of registration.  As part of their Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce project, PSI have committed to share any relevant data emerging as part of that project with relevant Government departments, along with relevant first-time registration data with the relevant Government departments, particularly if trends are identified that indicate a future deficit. </p>  <p>  This is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the community pharmacy sector in a range of other countries. However, robust data for Ireland is needed to be able to determine the current landscape, assess future health system needs and understand existing sectoral challenges now and into the future.  It will be on the basis of gathering and analysing this up-to-date, robust and relevant data, that recommendations can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs as Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.    </p></reply>

The problem became particularly acute over the last couple of years as a significant number of contracted dentists chose to opt out of the DTSS.</p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. To address the concerns of contractors about the viability of the Scheme, I am also using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings and restorations.</p>  <p>The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the Scheme this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million. Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1st May. I would hope that this substantial additional investment in the Scheme will encourage more and more dentists to provide care to medical card patients.</p>  <p>  I understand that contractors are looking for more substantive reform of the Scheme and that is my intention. These measures that I have announced are interim measures, designed to address immediate concerns with the Scheme, pending a more substantive reform of dental services to align with the National Oral Health Policy. </p>  <p>  Work on that longer-term project has already commenced and I have asked my officials and the HSE to undertake further engagement with all dental stakeholders in implementing necessary reforms.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-06-02a.1088.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022060200077#WRU04200"><p>The HSE has no statutory responsibility for providing transport to Day Services, and transport to day services is not usually provided for service users. A variety of transport solutions are pursued nationally, including service provider transport, and I do acknowledge that transport to day services can be a significant issue for some service users.</p>  <p>  In CHO1 however, as this is a particularly rural area with limited public transport options, and many service users require assistance to access their disability services, the HSE has developed a transport service in conjunction with Local Link and SITT, an Seirbh&iacute;s Iompair Tuaithe Teoranta, the Rural Transport Service Ltd. in Co. Donegal.</p>  <p>  There is a shared commitment in CHO 1 to provide a quality driven and person-centred health care service, within allocated resources, that meets the needs of service users as close to home as possible. There is also a history of partnership, working with local community and voluntary agencies, local authorities and the educational sector, all with a shared commitment to improve the health of the population living in those counties.</p>  <p>  A process was initiated in Donegal in 2008 to create a partnership with Local Rural Transport Companies around transporting people to HSE services, and following a successful pilot this was rolled out on a phased basis to the rest of the county between 2009 and 2012, and there is now a transport service in place across all five counties within CHO1.</p>  <p>  Service users from a number of HSE services avail of this dedicated transport service, including Older Persons, Disability and Mental Health services.</p>  <p>  The HSE cover the cost of 90% of this service, and day service passengers in all areas of CHO1 have been asked to pay &euro;4 return on these HSE transport routes as a contribution to the overall transport costs incurred. Passenger fares commenced in 2008 in Donegal, 2012 in Sligo and Leitrim and 2019 in Cavan and Monaghan.</p>  <p>  Some service users in these counties are able to use public Local Link services to reach their day service, and they can use their Free Travel pass on these. However, these routes do not always meet the needs of service users in terms of routes available or supports needed, and so there remains a need for the closed, HSE funded, transport routes where the &euro;4 return daily contribution charge is collected.</p>  <p>  Passengers receive a high-quality, door to door service, provided by Garda vetted drivers and bus assistants, with the shortest possible journey times incurred. This dedicated transport service is safe and fully accessible and focused on the needs of those people with disabilities who use it every day.</p>  <p>  This transport service is crucial in getting people to their day services and other HSE services, services which so many missed attending during the worst periods of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Given the increasing costs of providing transport, and to enable the continued delivery of this essential service, the continuation of the &euro;4 charge is necessary to keep the service running. At a national level, the government is seeking to improve access to public transport, particularly in rural areas and for those with disabilities, and much work is underway to ensure that in the coming years more people will be able to avail of public transport services where they can use their Free Travel Pass.</p>  <p>  There is no standard approach to transport throughout the disability services sector, some providers do not provide transport while others provide transport to some service users and not to others, due to the historical nature of many of the arrangements. In CHO1, this transport service is provided with the associated charge to service users, and I acknowledge that the varying approaches across CHOs have led to inequalities for service users. I will be engaging with the HSE on the matter. </p>  <p>  At the start of this year I reconvened the Transport Working Group under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, which is leading a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The government acknowledges that there are transport challenges for people with disabilities and it is determined to work towards addressing these challenges and to break down barriers to independent living and equal participation in society. That is my clear focus as Minister of State for Disabilities and it is the core objective of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.</p>  <p>  The government is committed to making progress on this issue and to developing the right solutions for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting Lis Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the attached document, provided to my Department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, outlines the number of patients aged over 60-74 and 75 on Outpatient and Inpatient waiting lists at the end of April 2022. The NTPF have advised some of the requested time-bands have been widened because using some of the requested time-bands would cause the small volume data to become too diluted.</p><p>  </p></reply>

These actions were developed to address the short-term issue of peat supply, the medium term one of future access to peat and also the longer-term issue of replacement with alternatives. </p>  <p>  The ultimate ambition is to support the horticulture industry, the people employed and the many families that depend on this important sector. </p>  <p>  Progress has been made on the implementation of the actions in the Working paper to address challenges related to horticultural peat supply.  </p>  <p>  My Department has commissioned an independent expert to work with all peat suppliers to ascertain the level of horticultural peat stocks available to growers. In addition, my Department has commissioned experts to provide focused regulatory guidance to those wishing to achieve regulatory compliance for extraction of horticultural peat on sub-30 hectare bogs for supply to the domestic horticulture industry. This work will build on the expert guidance published by the Environment, Climate and Communications and the National Parks and Wildlife Service on engaging with the regulatory systems that apply to the extraction of peat.  The work of these experts is ongoing.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to support and facilitate research in the development of alternatives to peat for horticulture. Funding of &euro;1.69m was awarded to Teagasc for research into utilising organic bio-resources and novel technologies to develop specifically designed and sustainable peat replacements.  Furthermore, funding is also provided for projects on peat alternatives through the EU Producer Organisation scheme for fruit and vegetables. </p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that we are leaving no stone unturned to protect this vital sector in the short, medium and long term. </p></reply>

The Town and Village Renewal Scheme prioritises the renovation of derelict and vacant buildings in our town centres, with a view to bringing these buildings back into use as multi-purpose community spaces and remote working hubs. The RRDF scheme supports projects that involve the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as Enterprise and Co-Working spaces.</p>  <p>  In May I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform. This platform offers a suite of booking, hub management and e-commerce applications to members of the Network. The National Hub Network Working Group initially identified and mapped over 400 remote working hubs. To date, approximately 240 hubs have joined the Connected Hubs Network and been on boarded onto the platform, with this number rising on an ongoing basis.  </p>  <p>  My department also recently completed the assessments of the 2022 Connected Hubs Call, to which I have allocated &euro;5M in funding to further develop and leverage the capacity of the National Hub Network. This is in addition to the almost &euro;9M in funding allocated last year under the same scheme. All existing remote working facilities, including private enterprise hubs were eligible to apply. The successful applicants under the 2022 Call will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  To date my focus has been on establishing the network and on achieving the initial critical mass. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of the project, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. I am interested to hear how the hubs and their users see the future of the sector and have directed my officials to engage directly with the remote working community and relevant stakeholders as they assess the impact of both the National Hubs Network (connectedhubs.ie) and the Connected Hubs Call.  </p>  <p>  While we have acted quickly and decisively to ensure adequate provision of services to date, it is vital that, as we develop a strategy for the development of the National Hub Network, we take stock of what has been achieved and what still needs to be done. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the National Hub Network will continue to make a central contribution to the achievement of the Government's vision for rural Ireland, as set out in Our Rural Future.</p></reply>

Each LAG has a defined funding allocation for the duration of the programme. Project applications are made to, and approved by, the relevant LAG in each LEADER area.</p>  <p>  In line with the programme operating rules, the LAG may not increase the level of funding in respect of an individual project once that project has been approved.  However, with LAG approval, there is scope for flexibility within the LEADER programme that allows the project promotor to modify an element of the project subject to certain limits. The savings achieved by the modification may be used to offset increased costs on another element of the same project.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department will consider requests from Local Action Groups on a case by case basis for a derogation from the pre-set limits outlined in the LEADER Operating Rules where the proposed savings arising from modifications exceeds the limits permitted.</p></reply>
