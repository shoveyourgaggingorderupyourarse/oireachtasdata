As I have alluded to previously, given the size and openness of the Curragh Plains it is difficult to prevent this activity. However, it is dealt with expeditiously once it has been identified.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-07a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018090700003#WRA00900"><p>Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) has no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality.</p>  <p>  The triple lock mechanism (UN mandate, Government and D&aacute;il approval), is the decision making process under which contingents of the Permanent Defence Force may be deployed overseas on international peace support and crisis management operations.  PESCO relates to an EU mechanism for the development of defence capabilities.  They are two entirely separate issues and participation in PESCO has no implications for the triple lock decision mechanism.  </p>  <p>  The PESCO participation criteria expressly stipulate that PESCO will be undertaken in full compliance with the Treaty on European Union and the associated protocols and will respect the Member States' constitutional provisions.  The European treaties require that the EU respects the specific and different policies of Member States in the area of security and defence and that has not been changed or compromised by our participation in PESCO. </p>  <p>  PESCO was specifically referenced in the Lisbon Treaty Protocol, and in Ireland&rsquo;s national declaration, to address the concerns of the Irish People.  The Legislation setting down Ireland&rsquo;s approval process for PESCO was published in advance of that Vote and enacted in November 2009.  The Defence Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2009 required Government and D&aacute;il approval for participation in PESCO, both of which were secured before Ireland notified its intention to participate in PESCO.</p>  <p>  While we choose to remain neutral, this is not out of any lack of interest in issues underpinning conflicts or any isolationist stance.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to international relations is founded on full and active engagement in the international community in support of international peace and security and the rule of law.  We follow and will continue to follow this policy approach - militarily neutral but fully engaged &ndash; because, as committed members of the United Nations, we subscribe fully to the principles set out in the UN Charter. </p>  <p>  The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Under PESCO, Member States will come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations. It is important to note that participation in any PESCO project is on an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; basis and is therefore entirely voluntary. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that three other neutral EU Member States - Finland, Sweden and Austria - have also joined PESCO.</p></reply>

Ireland's ongoing active participation in a range of overseas peacekeeping missions is a key policy requirement. In this regard, as part of the overall approach to investing in the maintenance and development of military equipment and platform capabilities, the purchase of weapons affords the greatest possible essential force protection to Irish troops whilst on such missions.</p><p>Subhead A8 Defence Forces Capability Development, of Vote 36 Defence, makes provision for the acquisition and upgrade of Defensive Equipment including Aircraft, Naval Vessels, Armoured</p><p>Vehicles and Ammunition.

This was a special acknowledgement from the Government to the members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who served during the centenary year of 2016. The 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal was awarded as a commemorative medal, personal to an individual&rsquo;s service in the Defence Forces in the course of 2016.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to award the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to former members of the Defence Forces.  Since the foundation of the State many thousands of personnel have served in the Defence Forces.  It would not be administratively possible within the resources of the Department to identify and contact all of these persons, decide on eligibility and, in the case of infirm or deceased former members, resolve who should get the medal on their behalf. </p>  <p>  At my request, however, discussions took place between the Department and the Veterans&rsquo; Associations; the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (ONE), and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO), to explore alternative means of recognition of the contribution of veterans to the centenary commemorative events in 2016.  </p>  <p>  Following these discussions, it was agreed that a single presentation would be made to each of the Veterans Associations of a framed medal with an accompanying citation in recognition of the significant contribution of members of the three organisations to the 1916 centenary commemorative events and their service to the State. The medal has a bar with the term Veteran inscribed on it.  I agreed that a plaque would be given to each of IUNVA&rsquo;s 21 Posts and to each of O.N.E.&rsquo;s 41 Branches.  I presented one plaque to each of the three Veterans&rsquo; Associations at last year's Defence Forces&rsquo; Veterans&rsquo; Day which took place in the Defence Forces Training Centre, the Curragh, on Sunday 8th October 2017. The other plaques were presented separately.</p></reply>

This is not new and the Permanent Defence Force has always had a level of turnover that exceeds other areas of the public service. This is a feature of military organisations internationally.</p>  <p>  Exit questionnaires are given to personnel by the Defence Forces as part of the administrative processing of their departure.  Completion of such questionnaires, which are anonymous and confidential, is voluntary but personnel are encouraged to do so.  Additionally, voluntary exit interviews are conducted on certain personnel.  </p>  <p>  The military authorities have advised that records of surveys and interviews are regularly reviewed in order to assist with the identification of trends and explanations for personnel leaving the organisation and that an audit of the records has been conducted. While this information is analysed by the Defence Forces, any conclusions must take into account the voluntary nature of this information and gaps that may exist in providing a comprehensive account of the reasons for departure.</p></reply>

Following its introduction in 2012 for general service recruits, the military authorities have revised the approach to psychometric testing a number of times.  During that time the Defence Forces engaged the services of various psychometric testing companies for the purposes of administering tests to the different inductions streams (General Service, Cadetships, Apprenticeships and Direct Entry Schemes). The result of a psychometric test is a factor in determining overall suitability for admission to the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  The issue of colour vision deficiency is a complex one particularly in relation to ensuring a safe work environment.  The Defence Forces continue to consider how they could support personnel, who have colour vision deficiency, in areas such as medical standards, career progression, career streaming and operational availability.</p>  <p>  Senior civil and military management meet frequently to discuss different aspects of the recruitment process in order to ensure that the various processes are as efficient as possible and optimised to the needs of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Within this framework, Departmental officials and the military authorities have met with representatives of the company which currently provides psychometric testing to the Defence Forces. The purpose of this meeting was to enhance the understanding of the revised psychometric testing process. I am informed that no minutes of this meeting were circulated between the attendees.</p>  <p>  The current recruitment and induction process is kept under on-going review to ensure it continues to effectively determine suitability for entry to the Defence Forces.  </p></reply>

I am also advised that the Naval Service cannot stand over the provenance of the photograph used in the article in question and which is credited to &quot;Irish Navy&quot;&rdquo;.  I regret that the information afforded to me and which I communicated to the House in good faith at the time, was incorrect.  </p><p>On foot of the Deputies further question, I asked that the matter be further investigated.  I am now advised by the Naval Service that the pictures supplied were actually taken on board <i>L&Eacute;</i><i>Niamh</i>during the time it was rescuing migrants under Operation Pontus.  I am also advised that the wristband displayed in the photograph provided was applied by Naval Service personnel on board the L.&Eacute;. Niamh.</p><p>I am further advised that during Search and Rescue (SAR) operations undertaken in the Mediterranean, the standing operational procedure was that, as rescued persons came on board, each one was photographed and given a numbered wristband as part of their processing on board, which also included medical examination and assessment.  This procedure was to account for rescued persons on-board.  In addition, persons of interest, namely those persons in control of the migrant vessels and potential people traffickers, were identified as part of this process.  </p><p>On the 5<sup>th</sup>of August, 2015, as the Deputy will recall, there was a very significant rescue event in the Mediterranean where a fishing vessel carrying migrants capsized and several hundred migrants ended up in the water.  Given the massive scale and urgency of the rescue operation, the Executive Officer on LE NIAMH made the decision, when the first RHIB returned with rescued persons to the ship, that the ship&rsquo;s staff would not register embarked persons as per normal standing operational procedure, as saving lives was the main focus of their efforts and the rescued persons could be registered later.  The L&Eacute; Niamh rescued 367 persons (342 male, 12 female and 13 children).  25 bodies were also recovered and taken on board.  </p><p>On transit to Italy, the Naval Service deck parties were approached by rescued persons who identified a number of persons as the people who were in control of the fishing vessel.  These men were tagged and their photographs taken while on board LE Niamh. The witnesses that came forward were also given wristbands. The purpose of this was to identify both groups of people amongst the 365 persons that were on-board at the time.  </p><p>A number of persons were subsequently charged by the Italian authorities in connection with this incident.  A Mutual Legal Assistance request was received by the Central Authority for Mutual Assistance in the Department of Justice and Equality from the Italian authorities.  On foot of this request the prosecuting authorities in Italy were provided with photographic and video evidence of the event held by the Naval Service and a member of the Naval Service gave evidence in Italy attesting to the validity of that evidence.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter.

This was a special acknowledgement from the Government to the members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who served during the centenary year of 2016.</p>  <p>  There are no plans however to award the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal to former members of the Defence Forces.  Since the foundation of the State many thousands of personnel have served in the Defence Forces.  It would not be administratively possible within the resources of the Department to identify and contact all of these persons, decide on eligibility and, in the case of infirm or deceased former members, resolve who should get the medal on their behalf.</p>  <p>  At my request, discussions took place between the Department and the Veterans&rsquo; Associations, the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (ONE), and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO), to explore alternative means of recognition of the contribution of veterans to the centenary commemorative events in 2016.</p>  <p>  Following these discussions, it was agreed that a single presentation would be made to each of the Veterans Associations of a framed medal with an accompanying citation in recognition of the significant contribution of members of the three organisations to the 1916 centenary commemorative events and their service to the State.</p>  <p>  I also agreed that a plaque would be given to each of IUNVA&rsquo;s 21 Posts and to each of O.N.E.&rsquo;s 41 Branches.  I presented one plaque to each of the three Veterans&rsquo; Associations at last year's Defence Forces&rsquo; Veterans&rsquo; Day which took place in the Defence Forces Training Centre, the Curragh, on Sunday 8 October 2017. The other plaques were subsequently provided to the Associations for distribution to each of their individual branches/posts.</p></reply>

A review of its implementation was carried out by a civil-military group and their report was published in February 2007. This concluded that the goals outlined in the White Paper were being achieved and that the challenges that had emerged since 2000 were being met.  </p>  <p>  Following Government approval to prepare a new White Paper on Defence, the then Minister for Defence published a Green Paper on Defence in July 2013 and in doing so initiated a broad public consultative process. This was considered necessary as the White Paper 2000 had provided Ireland&rsquo;s defence policy framework and development strategy for over a decade. A new policy framework was required to reflect the many changes that had occurred in the defence and security environment at global, regional and domestic levels since 2000. As such, the latest White Paper, which was published in 2015, provides the current defence policy agenda over a ten year planning horizon and encompasses all work carried out by the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Civil Defence. It comprehends the Government&rsquo;s policy on defence of the State from armed aggression, the defence contribution to domestic security, the defence contribution to international peace and security and a broad range of other &ldquo;non-security&rdquo; roles which the Government require the Defence Forces and Civil Defence to undertake. It considers the defence capabilities required so that the Defence Forces can successfully deliver on the roles assigned by Government. Finally, the White Paper also considers implementation and the actions required to ensure that defence planning and provision processes are further developed.</p>  <p>  During scoping of the White Paper implementation programme 88 actions or projects were specifically identified. These actions represent a subset of the totality of the work being carried out as part of the implementation programme for the White Paper. While it is currently intended to have all 88 projects initiated or completed by the end of the ten year implementation programme, work in certain areas will continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are fully implemented and to assure that positive outcomes endure and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation. </p>  <p>  To date, 37 projects have been initiated with 10 more projects due to initiate during 2018. Of these, 6 projects have been completed and closed/transitioned to normal business with a number of other projects close to completion. </p></reply>

In 1998 the Minister for Defence wrote to Naas Urban District Council informing them that on completion of the refurbishment of the cannon it would not be returned to Naas but would be displayed in the Curragh Camp thereafter. The cannon is currently on display in a secure indoor location in the DFTC Museum in the Curragh.

In this regard, certain Defence Forces allowances were reduced by 5% with effect from 1 January 2010.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Stability Agreement, 2013-2016, (the Haddington Road Agreement), all sectors across the public service were required to contribute to additional pay and productivity measures. Other sectors delivered these savings through a variety of approaches including additional working time and reduced rates of overtime payments.</p>  <p>  The contribution from the Defence sector included a further reduction of 10% on the rate of certain allowances payable to the Defence Forces. As part of the cost saving measures to be secured under the agreement, it was also agreed with the Representative Associations that the Saturday and Sunday rates for Security Duty Allowance would be flat rated.</p>  <p>  Defence Forces pay is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which was considered and accepted by the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, provides for further increases in pay, ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement, with the focus of the agreement once again being on the lower paid. An increase of 1% due from 1 January 2018 has been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel and a second increase is due to be applied from 1 October 2018.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, a 1% increase is due to be paid from 1 January for all those on annualised salaries up to &euro;30,000. A further 1.75% increase in annualised salaries is due for all public servants (including Defence Forces personnel) from 1 September 2019.  </p>  <p>  By the end of the agreement (end 2020), the pay scales of all public servants encompassed by the Agreement, (including members of the Permanent Defence Force), earning up to &euro;70,000, will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances is also scheduled in the agreement.  </p></reply>

For Privates, Corporals and Sergeants with more than 3 years in service, MSA is worth &euro;115.43 per week, per person. For Senior NCOs the rate is &euro;122.87 per week. </p>  <p>  In line with any other occasion when the Defence Forces are requested to operate in an Aid to the Civil Power, Defence Force members on duty in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the Papal visit will receive Security Duty Allowance (SDA).  The current rates of SDA is &euro;23.81 for each day on duty for less than 24 hours.  The rate is increased to &euro;47.59 for a 24 hour duty.  Security Duty allowance is paid to all enlisted personnel and to officers up to and including the rank of Commandant. </p>  <p>  Defence Forces personnel routinely encounter difficult conditions when deployed operationally, personnel are trained and equipped to have the resilience to deal with the conditions in order to successfully complete their mission.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that I engage with the Defence Forces on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  The assistance provided by the Defence Forces for the duration of the Papal visit is greatly appreciated and acknowledged by myself and my colleagues in Government.</p></reply>

Much of the Law is declaratory in nature, and it remains to be seen how much direct impact it will have in practice. However, even on a symbolic level, it risks marginalising Israeli citizens who are not Jewish, in particular the 20% of Israeli citizens who identify as Arab or Palestinian. It sends worrying signals about their status and their right to equality in the country which is their home.  Some of these Israelis have already expressed fears that the new law, which has the status of a Basic Law, may be a starting point for discrimination against minorities within Israel. There have been public demonstrations in Israel to express concerns about this Law.</p>  <p>  The Israeli Declaration of Independence stated that Israel will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex. For those Israelis whose first language is Arabic, the official status which that language has hitherto had is symbolically important of their status as equal citizens, as well as being important from a practical perspective.  This new law sets out to privilege Jewish communities, and I know that many Israelis, both Arab and Jewish, have reacted with dismay to this.</p>  <p>  A key point is that this new law states that "... the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people". Nobody is denying the strong connection between the Jewish people and Israel. But Israel is also a home to many who are not Jewish, and this law sends a worrying signal about their rights as Israeli citizens, and the part they have to play in Israel&rsquo;s democracy.   </p>  <p>  I am also particularly concerned about the references to Jewish settlement. There have been different interpretations of whether this refers to Israel only, or also to the West Bank, but the ambiguity is very unhelpful in a volatile situation. The Government is wholly opposed to the construction of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. This language is also extremely worrying in the context of a number of pieces of legislation being proposed, and already passed, by the Knesset, which blur the lines between Israel and the West Bank.</p>  <p>  As I said, it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice. My Department has signalled our concerns to the Israeli Embassy here, and continues to monitor the situation closely.</p></reply>

The escalation of violence in its southwest is the most pressing threat to political stability in Cameroon. </p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned by reports of violence against civilians. I believe that constructive dialogue remains the way towards a lasting solution to the crisis, preserving unity and peace for all the people of Cameroon.  Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the Government of Cameroon to ensure free, transparent, and credible elections and strongly discourage election related violence during next month&rsquo;s presidential elections. </p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have an Embassy in Cameroon, we continue to monitor the circumstances there closely. The Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria, which hosts many refugees from Cameroon, tracks the evolving situation and its regional impact, including through engagement with regional bodies.  This is supplemented by ongoing contacts with the EU delegation in Yaound&eacute;. </p>  <p>  In this context, I recall the EEAS statement of 7 February on the situation in Cameroon, which called on all sides to refrain from acts which might exacerbate tensions.  It remains the responsibility of the Government of Cameroon to create a secure environment in which all citizens are protected from violence, and where international human rights standards, including protection for minority groups, are upheld. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the efforts of United Nations bodies providing aid to those affected by the conflict.  An Irish Aid rapid responder has been deployed to Cameroon to assist the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).</p>  <p>  The human rights situation in Cameroon was most recently reviewed in May by the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, under the Universal Periodic Review mechanism. Ireland fully participated in those discussions.</p></reply>

Three years of war have had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights, international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life. Three quarters of the population are estimated to require some form of humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  I, and officials in my Department, have been monitoring the state of affairs in Yemen with growing anxiety, particularly in recent weeks as multiple reports of attacks affecting civilians have circulated. I remain deeply concerned by the level of violence in Yemen, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. I condemn in the strongest terms all actions which endanger civilians, including those attacks referenced by the Deputies. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department regularly convey to the Saudi Embassy in Dublin my strong concerns in relation to the situation in Yemen, and the impact the fighting is having on civilians, especially children. They also conveyed my condemnation of missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, which also have the potential to impact on civilians. There have also been EU contacts with Saudi Arabia in relation to concerns about civilians in Yemen. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also worked in the UN system to raise our grave concerns about human rights in Yemen. At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen. The resolution established a group of international experts to examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground. Ireland is still examining the report of the findings of the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen that was published last week. We look forward to discussing it further with our partners later this month at the next session of the Human Rights Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided &euro;15.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance to Yemen since the conflict began in 2015. Of this, &euro;4 million was contributed this year alone.  Ireland also provides global funding to a number of organisations which are particularly active in Yemen including the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). </p>  <p>  On the problems posed by arms transfers to conflict regions, Ireland&rsquo;s efforts are concentrated on universalisation and implementation of the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which has been signed and ratified by all EU Member States. The ATT is the first legally binding instrument to regulate the international trade in conventional weapons. States which sign up to the Treaty are prohibited from exporting arms to countries if they know those weapons will be used to commit gross violations of human rights.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputies that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to urge stronger international action, and will press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-07a.142.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018090700005#WRC01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 to 53, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  Under Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Initiative, highly skilled and experienced individuals from a Rapid Response Corps, managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, can be rostered to provide short notice surge capacity to four UN partner organisations.  A Rapid Response Strategy was developed in 2015 and governs Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach.  This Strategy is available on the Irish Aid website.</p>  <p>  Individual members of the Rapid Response Corps are deployed at the request of those UN humanitarian agencies with which Ireland has concluded formal bilateral Stand-by Agreements, under the UN Stand-by Partnership Programme.  The four agencies with which Ireland has a Stand-by Agreement are: United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR); World Food Programme (WFP); United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); and United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF).  </p>  <p>  These organisations identify the specialist support required in a given emergency situation and request assistance from partners, including Ireland, in filling their skills gaps.  The support they require, and skill sets they demand, varies from emergency to emergency, and have changed over time as the nature, duration and location of crises have evolved.</p>  <p>  The Rapid Response Corps was launched in 2007.  Since then, there have been over 350 deployments of expert responders from the Irish roster, with in 2017 over 4,000 days of critical support provided by Irish corps members to stand-by partners.  </p>  <p>  Against a background of increasing humanitarian need internationally, changing stand-by partner demands, and in a context where a number of people were no longer available for deployment, it became clear that the roster of skilled people available for deployment as members of the Irish Rapid Response Corps needed to be replenished and supplemented.  Contacts with Ireland&rsquo;s UN stand-by partners identified the skillsets and expertise required, including language.  </p>  <p>  The requirements and format of 2018 selection process were set out in the Information Booklet accompanying the call for applications &ndash; we will provide a copy to the Deputy. </p>  <p>  The recruitment was widely publicized, including in print, electronic media and radio, in order to encourage as broad a range of new and talented applicants as possible.  While it is desirable that members of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps have an affinity with Ireland, the essential element is that members of the roster have the necessary skill sets to support Ireland&rsquo;s UN stand-by partners in their humanitarian responses.  Accordingly, Irish nationality is not a requirement of roster membership.  A high number of strong applications were received. Current members of the Rapid Response Corps were not required to re-apply. </p>  <p>  The process to assess applications received was managed in accordance with established best practice.  Two expert shortlisting panels and three interview panels were constituted, made up of experienced Departmental officials with a knowledge of the Rapid Response Initiative, the Corps and the needs of Ireland&rsquo;s UN stand-by partners, supplemented by three individuals with Rapid Response experience with a deep knowledge of the requirements.  Panel members were required to identify from the list of applicants where a possible conflict might apply: where possible conflicts of interest were identified, the panel member concerned neither assessed the relevant application nor interviewed the person concerned.  Unconscious bias training was also provided to panel members.</p>  <p>  The three members of the Rapid Response Corps who participated in the process were remunerated in line with the daily rate paid to members on deployment.  Two of the three also participated in the shortlisting in addition to the interviews.  Hotel accommodation was provided during the shortlisting and interview process.  Travel expenses, according to Civil Service rates, were paid.</p>  <p>  197 applications were received by the deadline of 16 May, 2018.  65 applicants were female and 132 were male. Late applications were not considered. 24 female and 61 male applicants were shortlisted for interview, of which 22 female and 47 male applicants successfully passed the interview stage. </p>  <p>  One applicant, who was not shortlisted for interview, appealed the decision of the Shortlisting Panel. In line with the appeals process, the application was re-assessed independently by a shortlisting panel not involved in the original decision. The appeal was not successful.  There are no further stages of appeal. The Code of Conduct of the Commission of Public Service Appointments is not applicable to the Rapid Response Corps recruitment process, as it relates to permanent appointments to the civil service.</p>  <p>  Applicants were required to be fluent in English. Additionally, French and Arabic were considered as desirable requirements, as requested by our stand-by partners in the UN &ndash; the goal of the Roster is ultimately to meet the demand driven needs of these partners.   </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps roster and the Election Observation roster have different objectives and requirements. This is reflected in the criteria and in the recruitment processes for both, with the nature, duration and location of Rapid Response Corps deployments a deciding factor in determining the need for interview in the case of this roster.</p></reply>

It helps to raise our visibility internationally, promotes a positive image for the country and represents a powerful means to forge connections with other countries.  It is a key driver for our tourist industry.  Culture is also an important economic sector in its own right, generating jobs and stimulating economic activity across the country.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to investing in and promoting our culture nationally and overseas.  Primary responsibility for the promotion of Irish arts and culture overseas lies with my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and is operated through Culture Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Mission network work closely with Culture Ireland to maximise the impact of our investment in cultural promotion overseas.  Department officials participate in meetings of the Expert Advisory Committee, the group charged with evaluating and making recommendations on applications for Culture Ireland funding.</p>  <p>  Culture forms a key part of my Department&rsquo;s promotion of Ireland internationally.  We do this through a range of activities undertaken at HQ and through the network of Embassies and Consulates.  Under the Promoting Ireland programme, each mission is provided with a budget which is used to fund activities in pursuit of the five high level goals set out in &ldquo;The Global Island &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World&rdquo;: Our People, Our Values, Our Prosperity, Our Place in Europe and Our Influence.  Cultural performances play an important part in this regard.  In 2017, 24% of missions&rsquo; spending under the programme was classified as support for cultural promotion.  </p>  <p>  This funding covers a number of activities including support for side events linked to performances by individuals and groups travelling independently from Ireland or those in receipt of Culture Ireland funding.  Funding is also provided for cultural performances by Irish citizens and the wider diaspora living overseas.  Missions may also directly arrange for cultural groups to travel from Ireland to perform in their countries of accreditation, usually around the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day period.  In such cases, funding is generally confined to travel and subsistence costs and with effect from 2018 on a pilot basis, a modest performance fee may occasionally be paid.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Trade Division also has a limited budget to support the promotion of Irish culture internationally.  This includes the provision of &euro;150,000 annually to the Centre Culturel Irlandais, which promotes Irish culture and performers in Paris.  The Division also provides resources to missions, principally in the form of exhibitions which showcase Irish literature and culture.</p></reply>

Ireland has strongly supported the mandate of the IIFFM since it was established in March 2017 and I offer my thanks to them for their work and for this report.  The findings of the IIFFM corroborate many of the eyewitness accounts which have emerged from Myanmar in recent times. In particular the report provides credible findings that human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by members of the Burmese Military (Tatmadaw) and other security forces in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States. These crimes include the widespread killing of civilians; rape and sexual violence; torture and enforced disappearances. </p>  <p>  The IIFFM&rsquo;s report also finds that there is sufficient evidence of crimes committed in Rakhine State being so grave that they warrant a competent court to determine the liability for the crime of genocide of those in the Tatmadaw chain of command. </p>  <p>  I fully support the findings of the IIFFM. The work of the IIFFM in investigating allegations, recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability. </p>  <p>  The report of the IIFFMM notes that the crimes in Myanmar &ldquo;stem from deep fractures in society and structural problems that have been apparent and unaddressed for decades.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  It is therefore imperative that Myanmar and the international community respond comprehensively to the findings of the report and its recommendations in a way that addresses the long-standing root causes of this crisis and in a manner that ensures the perpetrators of the crimes described in the report are swiftly brought to justice.</p>  <p>  I have taken note of the recommendations and Ireland is actively engaging with our international partners in preparing responses, including at the upcoming 39th  Session of the Human Rights Council where this report will be formally presented.</p></reply>

The rights of freedom of expression and to peaceful demonstration are essential to a functioning democracy and must be protected.</p>  <p>  Although great advances have been made in Guatemala since the signing of peace accords in 1996 that marked the end of three decades of civil war, I am aware that there are concerns about a culture of historic impunity that remains.  I urge the Government of Guatemala to fully investigate the incidents to which the Deputy refers and to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>  <p>  Ireland engaged in the Review of Guatemala during the 28th  Session of Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva in November 2017.  We took this opportunity to voice concerns over attacks and intimidation against human rights defenders in Guatemala, and called on the Government of Guatemala to take all necessary measures to protect human rights defenders. </p>  <p>  We also took the opportunity of the Universal Periodic Review to urge the Government of Guatemala to continue with its efforts to address inequality suffered by indigenous peoples, a group which I understand is heavily affected by the violence outlined by the Deputy.  I reiterate these calls today and urge their Government to protect all civil society actors and their ability to carry out their important work across the country.  While we do not have a resident embassy in Guatemala, my officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin meet regularly with civil society organisations and human rights defenders active in Guatemala and the wider region, and raise concerns at EU and international level.</p></reply>

I am concerned by reports that the death penalty is being considered by the prosecutor in this case, as well as the reports of the conduct of the pretrial proceedings. Ireland is unequivocal in its stance on the death penalty and we oppose its use in all circumstances.  The abolition of the death penalty is one of Ireland&rsquo;s international priorities, and my Department regularly conveys our stance on this issue to all countries where the death penalty is still in use.  The continued imposition and scale of death sentences in Saudi Arabia continues to be a cause for grave concern.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently availed of appropriate opportunities to raise issues of human rights in Saudi Arabia, bilaterally with interlocutors from Saudi Arabia, as well as at EU and international level. During the last Irish Foreign Minister level visit to Saudi Arabia, a Trade Mission to the Kingdom in late 2016, my predecessor, Minister Flanagan, had a discussion around human rights, including the use of the death penalty, with his counterpart.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department regularly raise human rights cases with the Saudi Embassy here in Dublin. Our Embassy in Riyadh raises a range of human rights issues directly with the Saudi authorities. </p>  <p>  The EU in Riyadh also takes the opportunity to raise concerns with the Saudi authorities. In August, the EU had a frank and constructive first dialogue on Human Rights with the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia. The EU is now seeking to follow up on this by establishing a permanent bilateral dialogue forum on Human Rights between the EU and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is hoped such a dialogue will allow for further candid discussions on human rights issues in Saudi Arabia, and the possibility of cooperation in the field of human rights protection and promotion.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have raised our concerns about the use of the death penalty generally, and Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s use in particular, in relevant human rights fora. At the Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2018, Ireland made a specific reference to Saudi Arabia in our national Item 4 statement, highlighting our grave concerns over &ldquo;the continued use of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  My officials and I will continue to raise our concerns about human rights issues, and specifically the continued use of the death penalty, directly with the Saudi authorities, and at EU and international levels, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

Ireland attaches great importance to safeguarding the human rights of all prisoners with due regard for the international standards enshrined in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.</p>  <p>  I remain very concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Bahrain.  Statements from the Bahraini Government on its commitment to safeguarding human rights enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution are undermined by ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression.  A number of worrying developments suggest an increasingly restrictive approach, targeting those who express disagreement with or criticism of the Government.  The shrinking of civil and political space is especially concerning in light of parliamentary elections which are due to take place in November this year. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights issues in Bahrain are regularly conveyed to the Bahraini authorities, including through the Bahraini Embassy in London and through Ireland&rsquo;s (non-resident) Ambassador to Bahrain. In February of this year, officials from my Department met with the Ambassador of Bahrain in Dublin, and raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain, including the case referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Ireland also regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at the Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. In Ireland&rsquo;s Item 4 Statement (human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention) at the HRC session in June 2018, we called on Bahrain to &ldquo;maintain its commitments to respect freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to fair trial.&rdquo; Ireland also supported the references made to Bahrain in the EU Item 2 Statement (on the reports of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights) which highlighted the deterioration of the human rights situation, with particular reference to the shrinking of political space in Bahrain. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Bahrain, and will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to make good on their stated commitment to make progress in the area of human rights.</p></reply>

The event was attended by over 200 German Heads of Mission and some 700 German business people from all sectors of the economy. Later, I had a constructive bilateral meeting with Minister Maas where we discussed Brexit at some length. Germany has been a consistent supporter of Ireland in the Brexit negotiations, something we greatly appreciate, and this was reaffirmed by the Minister both in our meeting and in the subsequent press conference.  We also had very useful exchanges on the EU&rsquo;s Multi-Annual Financial Framework, migration and the implementation of the recently-published review of Irish German relations, including the opening next year of a Consulate in Frankfurt.</p>  <p>  I then met with the CEO of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, and this was followed by a background briefing, hosted by Reuters, for a number of political correspondents in the German press and broadcast media. I also did an interview with Reuters TV.</p>  <p>  Germany is an indispensable partner for Ireland, both in the European Union and bilaterally.

Both sets of negotiators have committed to bringing new energy to the talks, including on the Irish specific issues, and I welcome these commitments.  It is important to recall that there are in effect two separate, though linked, negotiations: one to agree a full legal Withdrawal Agreement, and the other to reach a political understanding on the framework for future relations. It is the former which is the immediate priority.</p>  <p>  In his statement on 31 August following his meeting with the UK Secretary of State, Dominic Raab, the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier noted some progress on a number of remaining issues in the recent negotiations, including on the handling of data in the context of the withdrawal, though more progress is needed on the issue of geographical indications. Discussions to agree a political declaration on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship have also begun in earnest since the resumption of negotiations last month. This has been enabled by the UK&rsquo;s White Paper on the future relationship and is being taken forward on the basis of the European Council Guidelines agreed in March. In this context, there has been a convergence of views on the ambition of future EU-UK cooperation on foreign policy, security and defence.  However, it is also clear that there remain very substantial differences on many issues.</p>  <p>  Regarding the backstop, Michel Barnier again stressed on 31 August that a legally operable solution for the Irish backstop is essential for agreeing the Withdrawal Agreement and called on the UK to provide the necessary data for the purpose of examining technical issues on the nature, location and modality of the controls needed in the event of the backstop being implemented. </p>  <p>  Our position and that of the EU remains that while we would like to see the border issue resolved through the future relationship, there must be a backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement that provides absolute certainty that no matter what the outcome to the negotiations on the future relationship, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  We have a firm commitment from Prime Minister May &ndash; if no other solution is agreed &ndash; to full alignment with the relevant rules of the Single Market and Customs Union to deliver on her guarantee of avoiding a hard border. In March, she also agreed to having a legally operative &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; in the Withdrawal Agreement. </p>  <p>  The EU and Ireland will hold the UK to these commitments. As the European Council made very clear at its meeting in June, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and there can be no Withdrawal Agreement, and therefore no transition, without an agreement on the backstop. Ministers reiterated this in Brussels on 20 July and agreed that renewed efforts are needed to conclude, as soon as possible, all outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop. The EU27 also reaffirmed their solidarity and support for Ireland. </p></reply>

We are also developing a system whereby people will be able to provide the documents to support these applications from anywhere in the world.  The expansion of our new online services will be launched by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  An extensive engagement campaign will coincide with this launch to promote its use as the fastest and most convenient way to renew a passport.

We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level on international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The call for applications to establish a new Election Observation roster was issued on 2 July last and the call was open until 20 August 2018.  Late applications were not accepted. The call was published on two Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade websites: and <i><font color="#0082BF">.</font></i>It was also publicised on social media. </p><p>As the closing date for submission of applications has only recently passed and as applications are still being verified and screened, it would not be appropriate for the Department to provide details on the applications until the selection process is completed and the roster established.</p><p>The candidate information booklet which was provided to all applicants and also published on the Departments website set out all of the necessary details about the operation of the roster, the eligibility requirements, criteria and the process and methodology leading to the establishment of the roster.</p><p>In the interests of an efficient process, and taking into account manifold other demands on staff, including the continuing prudential management of Irish Aid funding, it was decided that the assessment of applications to join the new Election Observation Roster should be a paper-based exercise. While interviews had been considered, they are now not planned. This rationale was set in the letter of 9 July 2018 from the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, available on the Oireachtas website. </p><p>A number of selection panels will be established to appraise all of the applications that meet the essential criteria. The selection panels will consist of two officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and one external person who will have appropriate experience. Panel members will receive application assessment and unconscious bias training. All panel members will be obliged to disclose any potential conflict of interest. If such an interest is notified, appropriate safeguards will be implemented. A calibration exercise will be conducted to ensure consistency. All applicants will be appraised on the basis of the information contained and set out on the official application form.  Verification of data contained in the application, including language proficiency, will also form part of the process.</p><p>All applicants seeking to join the election roster will be appraised against the criteria set out in the Volunteer Information Booklet. Further, all applicants will be treated in exactly the same way regardless of whether they have been on a previous roster. The current roster will be extinguished once the new roster is formally established. The key objective is to generate a sufficient cadre of available, qualified volunteers which can meet the needs of election observation missions, as the EU and OSCE require, and which evolve over time. </p><p>It is expected that the process to establish the new roster will be finalised by the end of 2018.</p></reply>

We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level on international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). I refer the Deputy to the responses to previous Parliamentary Questions on this matter, Question 138 of 10 July 2018, Question 167 of 4 July 2018, Questions 167 and 172 of 25 October 2017, Questions 357 and 358 of 13 December 2016, Question 243 of 2 November 2016 and Questions 335, 336 and 337 of 14 June 2016.</p>  <p>  The OSCE issued a request for long-term observers to participate in the Limited Election Observation Mission (LEOM) for the Mid-term Congressional elections in the United States of America, scheduled to take place on 06 November 2018. The OSCE indicated verbally to the Election Desk that they were reissuing this call requesting the assistance of participating States in seconding long-term observers for this LEOM.</p>  <p>  The standard practice of the Department has been to focus on elections in developing countries and emerging democracies and not to deploy observers for elections in EU Member States, the United States and Canada. However, in the case at issue, the OSCE made a specific request to Ireland to nominate a long-term observer, having difficulty finding a full complement. Following careful consideration of this request, and in line with Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding support for the OSCE, one long-term observer from the Irish panel of election observers was nominated to participate in the OSCE Limited Election Observation Mission (LEOM) for the Mid-term Congressional elections in the United States of America, scheduled to take place on 6 November 2018. </p>  <p>  The criteria for selection for this LEOM is exactly the same as applied in all observation missions which was set out in the Information Note for Applicants accompanying the call for applications to join the Election Observation Roster established in 2013. </p>  <p>  For each election observation mission to which Ireland proposes to deploy observers, all roster members are invited to express their interest in the mission with a view to ensuring the widest possible participation. A shortlist is drawn up based on the specific criteria set out by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience, language proficiency, gender and length of time since serving on a mission.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate new observers or observers with limited experience.  However, the final decision rests with the inviting body, usually the OSCE or the European Union. </p>  <p>  The Department received 13 applications to participate in this LEOM from existing Roster Members by the deadline, 9 of whom were male members of the Roster and 4 were female members of the Roster. The Department did not receive any request for an appeal from unsuccessful applicants.  As the LEOM has not yet taken place, and no individual therefore yet been deployed, it would not be appropriate at this stage to release the name of potential observers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-07a.197.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018090700006#WRD02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 to 74, inclusive, together.</p><p>I refer the Deputy to the responses to previous parliamentary questions on these matters, including Question 109 of 24 July 2018, Questions 167, 166 and 172 of 25 October 2017 and Question 397 of 26 July 2017.</p><p>For each election observation mission, the EU or OSCE set out their specific requirements and as per normal practice all roster members are invited to apply to participate in any mission which Ireland proposes to deploy observers with a view to ensuring the widest possible participation in missions by roster members.  </p><p>In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate new observers or observers with limited experience. In selecting nominees to be put forward, the specific criteria set by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience, language proficiency, gender and length of time since serving on a mission, provide the main basis for decision-making. In cases where observers participated in a higher number of missions, this can be due to specific language requirements, the overall number of applications received, or other specific requirements which the EU or OSCE may identify from time to time depending on the specific circumstances of the election observation mission.</p><p>As previously communicated, a system to record data on withdrawals was put in place in 2015.  Since then, 21 individuals have withdrawn from 22 missions, including one roster member who withdrew on two occasions, at a total cost to the Department of &euro;1,268.82. In all but one case funds advanced by the Department were fully repaid.  </p><p>In one case repayment was not sought, as the pre-departure grant of &euro;600 had been paid to a nominated observer who had already advanced their preparations for an upcoming EU observation mission.  At a late stage, this observer was appointed by the EU to a different function.  Given the extreme lateness of the change &ndash; within a day or two of their anticipated departure on mission &ndash; pre-departure expenditure (such as vaccinations) had already been incurred.  Under the circumstances the Department did not seek the repayment of the grant.  In any case, the observer was selected by the EU for a separate mission within twelve months, and on that occasion was not paid the pre-departure grant.</p><p>Officials in my Department advise that early return from Election Observation Mission occur rarely, as Observers have committed to being available for the duration of the deployment. From the records available, only one Observer has returned early and this was due to the OSCE Election Observation Mission being cancelled and thus out of the control of the individual concerned. The Observer refunded the outstanding expenses paid in advance of their departure.</p><p>Taking account of members who have left the roster, and those who have been added from the reserve panel, the current roster complement stands at 191 and the reserve panel has been fully utilised.  The Department does not hold records regarding previous roster memberships. For privacy reasons, the Department does not disclose the date that members resigned or were removed from the roster, as these may relate to illness or bereavement among other reasons. </p><p><b>Names

I believe that this move is dangerous and will only have a negative effect on the Middle East region, and I have explicitly expressed my concern in contacts with the US administration.</p>  <p>  I have witnessed first-hand the vital services that UNRWA provides to the Palestinian people, not just in Gaza and the West Bank, but across the region. Entire generations of refugees have benefitted from UNRWA&rsquo;s provision of essential food, education, health care, relief and social services.</p>  <p>  I have visited the region three times since assuming my position as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, including a visit to Gaza in January where I met with UNRWA&rsquo;s Commissioner General, Pierre Kr&auml;henb&uuml;hl, and reconfirmed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to UNRWA. In Gaza, I saw for myself the challenges on the ground for UNRWA and the valuable work carried out by the Agency in delivering core services, especially in education and health, to some 5.3 million Palestine refugees, including over a million Gazans who depend on its assistance. The services that UNRWA provides are very necessary, and will remain necessary until a just and lasting solution is found.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been a longstanding supporter of the critical work undertaken by UNRWA. In January, in recognition of the challenges facing UNRWA in implementing its programmes this year, Ireland brought forward its 2018 contribution to the Programme Budget.  In June, I authorised a further contribution of &euro;250,000 for UNRWA in response to the urgent appeal of the UN Secretary General, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total funding to UNRWA to &euro;6 million this year, up from &euro;5.5 million last year. </p>  <p>  UNRWA&rsquo;s work is being carried out in an ever more complex and demanding environment. The conflict in Syria has put additional strain on UNRWA&rsquo;s operations in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, and the deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the ongoing occupation of the West Bank is resulting in continued hardship for refugees.  As a consequence, the demand for UNRWA&rsquo;s services has grown rapidly. The decision by the US to cease funding to UNRWA will undoubtedly exacerbate the Agency&rsquo;s funding shortfall and threaten essential services. Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue its assistance to the Palestinian people, including its support to UNRWA's services, while we will also continue our efforts to reach a two-state solution to the conflict. </p></reply>

That they were arrested for covering allegations of grave human rights violations by the Myanmar Military against the Rohingya community in Rakhine State makes this case all the more worrying. </p>  <p>  Media freedom and critical journalism are essential pillars of democracy. A free press has a key function in promoting transparency and holding democratic governments to account. I therefore call for the immediate and unconditional release of the two journalists and call on the Myanmar authorities to ensure adequate conditions for journalists to carry out their work.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to actively engage with our international partners on these and other issues of grave concern through bilateral contacts in Myanmar and via participation in the EU and UN responses including at the upcoming 39th Session of the Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland and the international community have taken a number of steps to address the Rohingya crisis which have focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis, promoting a political solution and pressing for accountability for crimes and other violations of human rights abuses that have occurred. </p>  <p>  While efforts aimed at achieving accountability and a political solution to the crisis are vitally important, there is an immediate need for a life-saving humanitarian response to the extremely difficult conditions faced by the huge numbers of displaced members of the Rohingya community now mainly in Bangladesh. To this end, Ireland has actively supported the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis and we provided direct funding of &euro;1 million in 2017 with an additional &euro;1.1 million allocated for 2018. Our support has focused on food, nutrition, shelter, water and sanitation.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also supported the intensive political response by the international community which continues to be pursued. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has consistently called for an independent and impartial investigation into the serious and credible allegations of human rights violations by the Myanmar security forces. In that regard, we have strongly supported the work of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country. Their work in investigating allegations, recording victim testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability.</p>  <p>  The recent publication of the Report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (IIFFMM) has made for harrowing reading. The report of the IIFFMM notes that the crimes in Myanmar &ldquo;stem from deep fractures in society and structural problems that have been apparent and unaddressed for decades.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  It is therefore imperative that Myanmar and the international community respond comprehensively to the findings of the report and its recommendations in a way that both addresses the long-standing root causes of this crisis and in a manner that ensures the perpetrators of the crimes described in the report are swiftly brought to justice. </p>  <p>  I have taken note of the recommendations and Ireland is actively engaging with our international partners in responding to the report, including at the upcoming 39th Session of the Human Rights Council where this report will be formally presented.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to press for progress in resolving this crisis including through our Embassies in Thailand and in Vietnam who are closely monitoring the situation.</p></reply>

I am deeply concerned about the serious, volatile, and rapidly deteriorating situation which is increasingly affecting neighbouring countries, and countries in the region. I continue to urge the Government of Venezuela to engage in dialogue with the opposition, to respect the electoral calendar and to fully restore the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions.  This is essential to achieving a resolution to the crisis.</p>  <p>  Reports of human rights violations are a cause of real concern.  Freedom of speech and freedom of peaceful assembly are fundamental rights that are the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and I call on the Government of Venezuela to respect these rights.  All parties must refrain from violence and work towards peaceful and democratic solutions.</p>  <p>  The humanitarian crisis is acute, and Ireland is supportive of the EU&rsquo;s funding for essential humanitarian aid in Venezuela and countries hosting Venezuelan refugees. </p>  <p>  We are also supportive of EU sanctions on Venezuela introduced in June of this year.  These sanctions are aimed at materials that can be used by the Government for internal repression, and create a legal framework for a travel ban and asset freeze against those who have shown blatant disregard for the rule of law and disrespect for democratic principles, including a number of Government officials.</p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have a resident embassy in Caracas, the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico is responsible for our diplomatic relations with Venezuela and is monitoring the situation closely and is in contact with the EU Missions in Caracas.  Officials from the Embassy, along with my officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin, regularly engage with partner organisations on the ground, and at EU and international level.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue this engagement and that I am committed to working towards a peaceful and democratic resolution to this crisis. </p></reply>

I have raised these concerns at the Foreign Affairs Council, as did the Taoiseach at the European Council in October 2017. I have repeatedly condemned these abuses, and will continue to raise my concerns at every appropriate opportunity.</p>  <p>  I continue to be alarmed by the conditions in Libyan detention centres, which are, at the very least, often overcrowded, fail to provide for basic living standards, and, given the lawless situation in Libya, lack appropriate oversight. There are still 8,000 migrants and refugees detained in Libya, and I am concerned about reports that the UN&rsquo;s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) is struggling to keep up with the large number of migrants arriving in these detention centres.</p>  <p>  While there is Libyan Government oversight in some detention centres, this needs to be vastly expanded and improved. In this regard, I reiterate my call on the Libyan Government, and all parties, including those with de facto control of territory, to take steps to eliminate ill-treatment of migrants, and to facilitate access to detention centres by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations</p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that over the last year, some progress has been made in alleviating the plight of migrants in Libya, and this must be built on. While there were over 50 detention centres in operation in Libya a year ago, only 17 of these remain open today.  More importantly, the effort to provide alternatives to detention seems to be bearing some fruit. For instance, I welcome the announcement by the IOM in July that the Libyan Government has agreed &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; that IOM would take responsibility for the care of people rescued at sea, rather than continuing use of detention centres. I call on the Libyan Government to make good on this promise as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Another alternative to detention which the EU has been supporting is voluntary repatriation, voluntary return, and humanitarian return of migrants from Libya. This can be a difficult process, but we have seen marked progress here too, with the IOM reporting that it has now safely returned nearly 11,000 migrants from Libya as of the first half of 2018. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants, and ensuring an end to human rights abuses, will require restoration of political stability and an end to lawlessness in Libya. This requires the formation of a fully functioning and unified government, and a return to order throughout the country. I call on all parties to cooperate fully with UN Special Representative Ghassan Salam&eacute;, whose efforts Ireland and the EU fully support. The EU will continue to work with the UN and others to support and reinforce Libya's sovereign institutions. </p>  <p>  In this context, the escalating violence in Tripoli in recent weeks is deeply troubling, as it has the potential to further destabilise the political crisis in Libya. I welcome the ceasefire agreed earlier this week, and call on all parties involved to respect its terms. Clashes such as these must not be allowed to distract from the political process aimed at reaching a sustainable solution to the crisis, which is ultimately the only way to bring an end to the suffering of the Libyan people, and the migrants and refugees present in the country.</p></reply>

I look forward to engaging further with the British Government through the Conference, as we continue to work together as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement to secure the effective operation of all of the institutions of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  I remain in very regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, as we seek a way beyond the current impasse with the devolved institutions.  We met most recently on 24 August in Dublin and spoke by phone on 5 September.  I am deeply concerned at the continuing impasse in Northern Ireland and I have conveyed that concern to Secretary of State Bradley, which she shares.</p>  <p>  On 6 September, Secretary of State Bradley, announced proposed temporary amendments to the legislative framework for the calling of an Assembly election, in the continuing absence of the Northern Ireland Executive.  This underlines the seriousness of the absence of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, and the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.</p>  <p>  The strong and consistent calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate must be heeded.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that a dialogue commenced between the political parties last week.  I want to see this followed up on with a political process that can secure an agreement on the operation of the devolved institutions. </p>  <p>  I will be engaging further with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on how both Governments can most effectively support that urgent work in the period immediately ahead.</p></reply>

To this end, co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being taken forward through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by my Department and on 18 July I presented a detailed Memorandum to the Government on Brexit Preparedness and Contingency Planning.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, was identified as an early priority and is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. </p>  <p>  This work has provided baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations. This is enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement, including a transitional arrangement, is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  On the basis of this work, relevant Departments have now been tasked by the Government to rollout detailed Action Plans with a view to advancing, as appropriate, the mitigating measures which have been identified in the areas of their responsibility from the planning to the implementation phase.  </p>  <p>  In line with this approach, the Government has already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focused on East-West trade and has mandated the presentation to Government before the end of September of detailed and costed proposals on the staffing, IT, infrastructural and operational requirements for the implementation at ports and airports of the necessary customs controls and sanitary and phytosanitary checks required as a result of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  </p>  <p>  All of this work is in addition to measures that have already been put in place to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector.  Capital expenditure of &euro;116bn over the coming decade under Project Ireland 2040 will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to my Department in Budget 2018 for the opening of six new diplomatic missions. A further seven new Missions will be opened as part of the next phase of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint. These thirteen new Missions will be located in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania and will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets.</p>  <p>  Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. In total 46 reports analysing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments. All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work at home, we are engaging actively with the European Commission&rsquo;s Article 50 Taskforce and its Brexit Preparedness Unit on areas where the lead policy role lies with the EU. </p></reply>

Commissioner Oettinger also met with the with Taoiseach, Minister Donohoe and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy during his visit, which was focused on the negotiations for the EU&rsquo;s 2021-27 Multiannual Financial Framework. The potential availability of support, if needed, for Ireland, and indeed for other countries or regions which might be affected by Brexit, will be considered during the MFF negotiations, which are at an early stage.  I am glad that the Commission&rsquo;s MFF proposals include a basis for taking that work forward.</p>  <p>  At present, the European Investment Bank is already providing support for the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Loan Scheme. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, is also working actively, with the support of other relevant Departments, with the European Commission to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules. The EU Commission has approved a &lsquo;rescue and restructuring&rsquo; scheme, which provides support to SMEs experiencing acute liquidity needs as a result of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Government is also working intensively to safeguard the significant financial support there has been for the border region of Ireland and for Northern Ireland, with almost &euro;2.4 billion of EU funding having been provided for successive PEACE and INTERREG programmes. The current programmes have a combined value of over &euro;550 million over the period 2014-2020, of which 85% is funded through the European Regional Development Fund. I welcome the Commission&rsquo;s most recent proposal for a special new PEACE PLUS programme as part of the next MFF which will build on and continue the work of successive PEACE and INTERREG programmes.</p></reply>

Instead, where commercially viable, it funds residential delivery on sites controlled by its debtors and receivers.  NAMA is making a significant contribution to the supply of housing within the State and has committed to facilitating the delivery of 20,000 residential units by the end of 2020, when the agency is due to wind up. </p>  <p>  As of August 2018, I am advised that NAMA has delivered over 7,800 new residential units as part of its residential delivery programme.  A further 2,800 homes are under construction and full planning permission has been granted for 7,800 units.  Planning has been lodged, or will be lodged in the next 12 months for an additional 10,200 homes.  Finally, pre-planning or feasibility work is underway on sites that have a delivery capacity for just over 15,000 residential units.</p>  <p>  In addition, NAMA has an established policy of identifying to Local Authorities and approved housing bodies, properties within its portfolio which may be suitable for social housing.  To date 6,984 such properties have been identified, with demand confirmed for 2,717 and 2,474 delivered or committed.  Part of this delivery has been through NAMA&rsquo;s innovative National Asset Residential Property Services (NARPS) model, which has purchased nearly 1,300 properties from NAMA debtors and leased them on for social housing.</p></reply>

Tariffs on goods imported from other countries depend on the details of any trade agreement between the EU and that country.</p></reply>

Given that individuals join trade unions largely for the well-known benefits of membership, and the potential value of the relief to an individual would equate to just over &euro;1 per week, this scheme would have little to no incentive effect on the numbers choosing to join. There is no specific market failure that needs to be addressed by such a scheme, and it would consist largely of deadweight.&quot;</p><p>Regarding the issue of tax relief on subscriptions to professional bodies, I refer the deputies to the section of the review which addressed this matter, stating:</p><p>&quot;There is a fundamental difference between membership of a professional body which is required to practice that profession and membership of a trade union, which is essentially, a personal choice.</p><p>Professional bodies often have a regulatory function, governing standards within a particular sector or industry, with practitioners or employees often required to be a member of a professional body in order to engage in employment in particular fields.</p><p>A person cannot be refused the right of employment for failure to join a trade union. By contrast, a person can be refused the right of employment as a solicitor, for example, if they fail to hold a practicing certificate.&quot;</p><p>Given the conclusion of the review, I have no plans to reintroduce such a relief.</p><p>Regarding the specific enquiry on the estimated cost of the relief if it were re-introduced and provided at the employee's marginal rate, the following table sets out details of the cost of the relief in the seven years immediately prior to its end.<table><tr><th><br /><br />   Year</th><th><br /><br />   Cost (&euro; million)</th><th><br /><br />   No. of  Claims</th></tr><tr><td><br /><br />   Year</td><td><br /><br />   Cost (&euro; million)</td><td><br /><br />   No. of Claims</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />  2004</td><td><br /><br />  10.7</td><td><br /><br />  248,300</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />  2005</td><td><br /><br />  11.8</td><td><br /><br />  272,100</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />  2006</td><td><br /><br />  19.2</td><td><br /><br />  294,300</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />  2007</td><td><br /><br />  20.7</td><td><br /><br />  316,300</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />  2008</td><td><br /><br />  26.4</td><td><br /><br />  341,900</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />  2009</td><td><br /><br />  26.7</td><td><br /><br />  345,800</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />  2010</td><td><br /><br />  26</td><td><br /><br />  337,500</td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that while these figures may not provide an accurate indicator of future costs of a new scheme, there is no other basis available to Revenue on which to estimate such costs.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that self-employed persons are generally taxed under the self-assessment system in Part 41A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Under Part 41A, a taxpayer is required to submit a tax return to Revenue by 31 October in the year following the tax year to which the return relates (or by mid-November, if paying and filing through ROS) and pay any balance of the liability (net of preliminary tax paid) in respect of income tax, USC and PRSI for the year to the Collector-General at the same time.  Where a self-employed individual discharges the combined income tax, USC and PRSI liability through the self-assessment system, a single payment is made in respect of the combined liability for all complete tax years up to and including the year in which he or she reaches their 65th year.  Where an individual is aged 66 or over in a tax year, PRSI is not chargeable for that year under the self-assessment system.  However, an individual who wishes to pay PRSI in respect of a period immediately prior to their 66th birthday should make the necessary arrangements with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Client Eligibility Services, Government Buildings, Cork Road, Waterford.</p>  <p>  A taxpayer who has income taxed under the PAYE system (such as a private pension or salary) and who also has taxable non-PAYE income (for example, from self-employment) may, in certain circumstances, where such income does not exceed &euro;5,000 request Revenue to reduce their annual PAYE tax credits and rate band entitlements, so that the tax on their non-PAYE income is deducted by their pension provider or employer. Any such taxpayer is not considered a chargeable person for self-assessment purposes and has no obligation to file an annual tax return under the self-assessment system. Revenue may, however, request a tax return from such taxpayers.</p>  <p>  Any further information that may be required in respect of PRSI liabilities for self-employed persons in their 66th year or the eligibility of such persons for social welfare benefits may be sought from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Revenue has confirmed that it does not maintain statistics in respect of either the number of persons the payment is not collected from or the estimated loss arising from same.</p></reply>

Revenue are legally bound to comply with these decisions in accordance with section 949AM of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA), 1997.  Pursuant to that provision, Revenue shall give effect to any determination made by the Appeal Commissioners unless the appeal has been appealed to the High Court in accordance with sections 949AP and 949AQ TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the making of a determination by the TAC is typically the final stage of a tax appeal, unless the determination is then appealed to the High Court.  In giving effect to a determination against a tax assessment, Revenue is required to calculate the tax chargeable (if any) in respect of the amount assessed to tax.  The result will be a withdrawal or amendment of the assessment, the making of a refund or the collection of any outstanding tax. </p>  <p>  Section 949E(1) TCA 1997 allows the TAC to give a direction to Revenue (and to appellants) in relation to the conduct or disposal of an appeal.  It is open to both Revenue and appellants to apply to the TAC to have a direction amended, suspended or set aside.  Such an application is typically made where the parties (i.e. Revenue and appellants) are not in a position to comply with the time limits imposed by the TAC for the submission of certain types of information or documentation and request additional time to comply with the direction. As directions are essentially related to procedural matters associated with the particular appeal, Revenue does not compile statistics on directions given to it by the TAC. </p>  <p>  A determination of an appeal is not a direction and cannot be amended, suspended or set aside.  As determinations are made by the TAC on an ongoing basis, at any point in time there will be determinations yet to be implemented by Revenue. However, statistics on such cases are not compiled and are not available.  Such instances would be rare and of not unreasonable duration given the statutory requirement for Revenue to give effect to determinations made by the TAC.  In any event, as the appeal has been determined at this stage, the tax liability would no longer be estimated but would be established in line with the TAC determination.</p>  <p>  There are currently fewer than ten determinations made by the TAC that are under appeal to the High Court and in relation to which the final tax liability has not yet been decided.  The tax in dispute for these cases is approximately &euro;3 million.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-07a.283.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018090700007#WRE05800"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of factors that influence mortgage interest rates in Ireland.  These include the high level of non-performing loans (NPLs), the low rate of repossessions, a reduced number of banks in the system and the high proportion of tracker rate mortgages on the bank books.</p>  <p>  In line with the continuing economic recovery, the level of mortgage arrears and non-performing loans has now declined from the peak but they are still significantly higher than most other euro zone countries.  High holdings of NPLs reduces profitability, increases  funding costs and ties up bank capital, which has a negative impact on the supply of new credit.  All of these factors feed through to higher interest rates for new mortgages.  Ireland&rsquo;s NPL ratio was 13.3% at Q1 in 2018 compared to an EU average of 4%. </p>  <p>  There is a very low rate of repossessions in Ireland.  The lower risk rating that secured lending attracts is compromised because the realisation of collateral is a lengthy and difficult process.  As mentioned previously in relation to NPLs, our low rate of repossessions leads to a lower supply of new credit and higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case for the market as a whole in the future.</p>  <p>  Competition has been reduced due to a decline in active lenders from 12 ten years ago to five now.  This is likely to be a contributing factor, along with the high level of NPLs, to the fact that Central Bank research from May 2015 found that the spread between official ECB rates and standard variable rate is relatively high and that new lending rates are above average compared to European peers. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank undertook research in the area of mortgage switching in 2017 through a public consultation with the objective of considering some possible changes to the Consumer Protection Code to further promote switching in the mortgage market.  This was to build on the measures introduced last year which required lenders to provide more information to borrowers on how they set and adjust standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages and also to improve the level of information they provide to borrowers about their other mortgage products which could provide savings for the SVR borrower.  The Central Bank published their responses to the submissions they received in June this year and an Addendum for Enhanced Mortgage Switching Measures: Transparency and Switching will come into effect on 1 January 2019.  Among the changes that will be introduced are:</p>  <p>  - The introduction of a fixed rate transparency measure which introduces a 60 day notification period for consumers whose rate is about to expire. </p>  <p>  - There will be enhanced mortgage transparency measures on variable rates on Loan-to-Value (LTV) which would mean lenders would notify consumers on an annual basis of whether they can, or cannot, move LTV interest rate bands, subject to the provision of an up-to-date valuation to their lender.  If the particular lender doesn&rsquo;t allow for such movement between LTV bands, they must notify the consumer that other banks may offer such movement.</p>  <p>  - A measure to improve the transparency of incentives linked to mortgages will be introduced to ensure sufficient clarity for the consumer and the advertising of same.</p>  <p>  - In terms of potential switching savings measures, on request of the consumer, lenders will be required to provide existing borrowers with an indicative comparison with alternative or new rates offered by that regulated entity only but also they will have to provide a link to the CCPC website that allows customers make sure they are availing of the best available interest rate.</p>  <p>  - All lenders will provide standardised information on the mortgage process and if switching, both the original and new mortgage lender will establish a switching point of contact/switch team. </p>  <p>  - All lenders will provide redemption figures to the consumer or their legal representative within 5 days and will keep the consumer updated throughout the mortgage process with specific timelines for the different parts of the process.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy can see, the higher rates charged for new mortgages in Ireland versus other European countries stem from a range of factors such as the high level of NPLs.  The ongoing recovery in our economy, which is reflected in strong employment growth, is helping to reduce the levels of NPLs, together with the range of initiatives and protections introduced for those in mortgage arrears.  </p>  <p>  The Government is of the opinion that increased competition and switching in the market, rather than administrative controls, remains the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.  </p></reply>

These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents which I cannot change unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  The interaction between both Department officials and myself and senior management of the banks in which the State has an investment takes place on a regular basis. As part of their ongoing engagement with the banks, Department officials meet with bank management during which a wide range of topics are discussed, including loan sales where relevant. Subsequent to these meetings, Department officials brief me as required. In addition to these meetings, I meet directly with the CEOs of each of the banks from time to time and loan sales would be included as an agenda item again where relevant.</p>  <p>  In relation specifically to the recently announced loan sale by PTSB, Project Glas, I was first informed by Department officials of the proposed transaction on Friday 19th   January. Department officials were first briefed on the timing of the sale and potential composition of the portfolio, earlier that week. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding a loan sale, I wish to highlight that the protections for borrowers in place before the sale remain unchanged. In this regard, it is important to note that there are no changes to the rights of a borrower whose loan is sold by a bank. All terms and conditions attached to their mortgage contract remain in place. I should also highlight that regardless of the protections that are currently in place for mortgage holders, I am prepared to engage with Deputies from other parties in an effort to see if these protections can be strengthened further in a sensible manner. This commitment has been demonstrated recently by the Government&rsquo;s support for the Bill introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath, T.D., which seeks to regulate the purchasers of mortgage loans. </p>  <p>  In addition, earlier this year I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible.  I have asked for the report to be completed as soon as is practicable. The Central Bank has stated that it is their intention to deliver the report by the end of September 2018. If as a result of this review the CCMA requires amendment, a full public consultation process would be required in line with normal guidelines. </p></reply>

This was a joint initiative between the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The review brought forward 25 recommendations. These recommendations are grouped into 6 broad categories that reflect government priorities: increase the mobility and the productive use of land, assist succession, complement wider agriculture policies and schemes, alternative farming models such as farm partnerships, responses to increasing income volatility, and general recommendations.  In particular, the review recommended the following measures to support and promote inter-generational transfer of farms:</p><p>- Retain Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax. </p><p>- Target Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax to qualified or full-time farmers or to land owners who lease land out on a long-term basis</p><p>- Retain Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax at current levels. For transfers under Retirement Relief, extend the eligible letting period of a qualifying asset to 25 years. </p><p>- For transfers other than to a child under Retirement Relief, as a once-off measure until the end of 2016, allow conacre lettings as eligible. </p><p>- Extend Stamp Duty Consanguinity Relief on Non-Residential Transfers to the end of 2017.</p><p>- Retain current stamp duty exemptions on transfers of land. </p><p>In 2017, the Minister Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I committed to establish an inter-departmental working group to review and assess the progress made on the implementation of tax measure recommendations contained in the Agri-taxation Review 2014 and to take stock of relevant changes in the environment in which the agri-sector operates. Work on this study is underway and its terms of reference are as follows:</p><p>1. A summary of the context, background and process of the Agri-tax Review.</p><p>2. An update of the context since the completion of the Agri-tax Review, to include: Brexit, Climate change 2020, the abolition of milk quotas. </p><p>3. A summary of outcome of Agri-taxation Review &amp;amp; implementation in Budgets 2015, 2016 &amp;amp; 2017, including a summary table of the recommendations and their implementation/current status. In particular, regard should be had to:</p><p>1. Analysing income stabilisation and the proposed farm deposit scheme, including a public consultation process and resultant submissions from stakeholders, and</p><p>2. the recommendation in the Agri-tax Review on data collection and management in order to comply with state-aid requirements.</p><p>3. The mapping of direct and tax expenditure supports available to the agricultural sector.</p><p>4. Any other matters arising in the course of the review.</p><p>I expect the study to be completed shortly.</p></reply>

Individuals who are subject to the high earner&rsquo;s restriction set out in Chapter 2A of Part 15 of the TCA 1997 are treated as chargeable persons for any year in which that restriction applies.  Consequently, such individuals are required to make a self-assessment tax return for the year in question.  The high earner&rsquo;s restriction effectively imposes a limit on the amount of certain tax reliefs that may be availed of by high income individuals. In general, the restriction applies where an individual has adjusted income of &euro;125,000 or more in a tax year, but can apply at a lower level where the individual has ring-fenced income, for example, interest which is subject to Deposit Interest Retention Tax. The individuals concerned must also provide details of the restriction to Revenue on Form RR1.</p>  <p>  2. Individuals (excluding certain company directors who are treated as chargeable persons and are required to file an annual self-assessment tax return) who have combined taxable profits from non-PAYE income of not more than &euro;5,000 per annum and who elect to pay the tax due on such profits through the PAYE system. Where an election is made, the individual must complete a tax return for that tax year when requested to so by Revenue.</p>  <p>  3. Individuals who are requested to do so by Revenue. Each year Revenue requires a return from a subset of PAYE taxpayers based on various criteria including income.</p>  <p>   I am also advised that PAYE Modernisation will result in the real time reporting of income for all PAYE taxpayers. From 1 January 2019 all employers will be obliged to report to Revenue the PAYE income and the associated income tax, PRSI and USC deductions for their employees as they pay them.</p>  <p>  I do not see that there is any need to change the current arrangements for the filing of tax returns. </p></reply>

When calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), inflation increased by just 0.3 per cent on an annual basis in 2017. This represents the fifth consecutive year in which inflation has been below 1 per cent.  The weakness in inflation in recent years reflects inter alia the impact of euro-sterling appreciation, following the UK referendum, on consumer prices in Ireland and in particular on the price of goods. </p>  <p>  Indeed, since the UK referendum goods prices have declined by 3&frac12; per cent and food prices have declined by almost 5 per cent. The contraction in the price of goods reflects, in part, the importance of the UK market as a source of imported consumer goods for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Whilst there remains significant uncertainty surrounding Brexit, it is clear that any barriers to trade will have a negative impact on Irish growth. Analysis by my Department and the ESRI suggests that in the absence of a trade deal with the UK, Irish GDP could be almost 4 per cent below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario after ten years. </p>  <p>  In relation to consumer prices, ESRI research indicates that Brexit could result in a potential increase in the level of CPI of between 2 to 3 per cent, relative to a no-Brexit baseline. This is equivalent to an increase of between &euro;892 and &euro;1,360 in the annual cost of the consumption basket for the average household. However, this assumes that there is no switching or changes in expenditure patterns in response to the price increase and is therefore an upper bound estimate of the impact of Brexit on consumer prices.</p>  <p>  The best way to mitigate such risks is to improve the resilience of the economy. The Government will play its part by continuing to implement competitiveness-oriented policies &ndash; including those that address emerging bottlenecks &ndash; and ensuring that the public finances continue to be managed in a prudent fashion.</p></reply>

The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and since April 2018 it has commenced the redemption of its &euro;1.6bn in subordinated debt. However, notwithstanding the successful achievement of repaying the State&rsquo;s contingent liability, three years ahead of schedule, there is still a significant body of work yet to be completed by NAMA. </p>  <p>  Subject to current market conditions prevailing NAMA projects a surplus in the region of &euro;3.5bn to be returned to the State once it completes its work. The realisation of this surplus depends on the redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s remaining subordinated debt by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.</p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full, which is expected to be in 2020.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs. </p>  <p>  In the meantime NAMA is making a significant contribution to the supply of housing within the State where it is in a position to do so. NAMA&rsquo;s residential funding programme is expected to fund the completion of 20,000 residential units by the end of 2020. NAMA is on track to meet this target with over 7,800 completed as of 21 August 2018. In addition, NAMA has an established policy of identifying to Local Authorities and approved housing bodies, properties within its portfolio which may be suitable for social housing. To date 6,984 such properties have been identified, with demand confirmed for 2,717 and 2,474 delivered or committed. Part of this delivery has been through NAMA&rsquo;s innovative National Asset Residential Property Services (NARPS) model, which has purchased nearly 1,300 properties from NAMA debtors and leased them on for social housing.</p></reply>

In addition, I conveyed the Government&rsquo;s full support for the Central Bank&rsquo;s actions to drive a resolution in the interests of consumers in the context of its Tracker Mortgage Examination. </p>  <p>  At the same time, as part of follow-up actions, I announced that I had requested the Governor of the Central Bank to provide me with a progress report by mid-December on whether the banks had made acceptable and sufficient progress in line with commitments they had given to resolve the matter. I duly received such a report and, in my statement of 20th December last, noted that the Central Bank concluded that the banks had made sufficient progress in meeting the targets they agreed to in October. In addition, I received a second progress report in April which gives further assurance in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s work is ongoing with a view to completing its Tracker Mortgage Examination and, accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to engage with any bank on an individual tracker related matter.

This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict Europe-wide definition of what constitutes an NPL by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which means that certain restructures are deemed NPL even if customers are meeting the revised payment schedule.  </p><p>Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016. I also met Ms Nouy, Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB. In the course of these discussions, my officials outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and made the case against continuing to classify some types of restructured loans, including certain split mortgages, as NPLs. While we have been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.  </p><p>Dealing specifically with Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s question about the inclusion of these split mortgages in bank sales, the Deputy will be aware that when PTSB first announced Project Glas - its planned sale of NPLs &ndash; back in February, the bank confirmed that loans which were restructured by way of a split mortgage were within the scope of the overall portfolio being considered for sale. However, the bank subsequently announced in May that it had withdrawn approximately &euro;0.9bn of principal dwelling houses (PDHs) split mortgages from the sale where borrowers were meeting the terms agreed with the bank. The removal of these restructured loans from the sale was a positive outcome for the borrowers which I welcomed.  </p><p>In terms of restructured loans that are performing being included in loan sales, most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. </p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;. This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013, and the SME Regulations.  Contractual terms are not changed by the sale of the loan.</p><p>Provision 3.11 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s (the Code) requires that, where a regulated lender intends to transfer all or part of its &lsquo;regulated activities&rsquo; to another regulated entity, it must provide advance notification to both the Central Bank and affected consumers.  Specifically, a lender must provide a consumer with at least 2 months&rsquo; notice before transferring all or part of its loan book covered by the Code to another person, including where the transferee is an unregulated entity. Where the transferee is an unregulated entity, the Code requires that the regulated lender also notify the consumer of the name of the regulated entity that will be &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; the loan for the unregulated entity.  In the event that there is a change in the credit servicing firm, the existing credit servicing firm must also notify the Central Bank and the consumer in advance, in accordance with the timelines set out under Provision 3.11 of the Code. Furthermore, I understand that the Central Bank expects all affected consumers to be informed of the term of their loan agreement which allows the loan to be sold and the identity and address of the new owner.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now titled the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2018 was considered by Select committee on 12 July. My officials worked with Deputy McGrath and other stakeholders to develop the Bill as initiated. This Bill will require that loan owners are regulated by the Central Bank. I expect that Report Stage will be taken after the summer recess.</p><p>I have also asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to ensure it remains effective and for the review to be completed as soon as possible. </p><p>Ensuring that the interests of consumers of financial services are protected is a key priority for the Government and the Central Bank.</p></reply>

Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. Therefore I am not in a position to give a reason as to why an extra flood premium charge is being applied to the area in question, but I do understand that flood defences are been improved in that region and could in time have a positive impact on premiums in the future. </p>  <p>  However, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

On foot of this review, revised Regulations with the addition of investment in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) as a permitted investment class for credit unions commenced on 1 March 2018. Since this date, credit unions are permitted to provide funding to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing.  </p>  <p>  This new investment framework for credit unions clarifies the scope and the manner in which credit unions can support the development of social housing. The Regulations require that investments by credit unions in Tier 3 AHBs must be made through a regulated investment vehicle. The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of a credit unions regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of a credit unions regulatory reserves for all other credit unions. These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitments in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government established an Innovation Fund to assist AHBs to develop structures, policies and new funding mechanisms. One of the projects being funded, which is being undertaken by the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH), is the development of a Special Purpose Vehicle to facilitate investment into the AHB sector by investors, including the Credit Union movement. The project was approved in May last year and is being undertaken by the ICSH in three phases. The first two phases have been completed and work on the third phase is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  With respect to any funding mechanisms specific to the Credit Union sector for investing in social housing, ultimately this will have to be put in place in the first instance by the credit unions themselves, with the support of their members, and with the approval of the Central Bank. In this regard it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the status of any regulated investment vehicle which the credit union sector is or could be developing to invest in Tier 3 AHBs.   </p></reply>

However, there are a number of tax based measures which are relevant to the Deputy's question.</p><p><b>Industrial Buildings Allowances &ndash; General Scheme </b></p><p>Industrial Buildings allowances are available for capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of various types of industrial buildings in use for the purposes of a trade, such as mills or factories, hotels, laboratories in use for the analysis of minerals and dock undertakings. Expenditure incurred is written off at a rate of 4% per annum over 25 years. In the case of other trades such as market gardening and the intensive production of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry or eggs, the rate of write-off is accelerated (10% per annum over 10 years). The qualifying period for incurring capital expenditure which would qualify for an accelerated allowance has terminated in relation to the trade of hotel-keeping and the operation and management of a registered nursing home amongst others. However, expenditure incurred may still be written-off at a rate of 10% over 10 years or 15% over years 1-6 and 10% in year 7 in some cases depending on when the asset was first brought into use.  </p><p><b>Industrial Buildings Allowances &ndash; Living City Initiative</b></p><p>The Living City Initiative is a scheme of property tax incentives aimed at the regeneration of certain areas (known as &ldquo;special regeneration areas&rdquo;) in the historic centres of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford. The scheme was launched in May 2015 and provides for tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment and conversion of both residential and commercial buildings. In relation to commercial buildings, expenditure is written off at rate of 15% per annum over 6 years and 10% in year 7. Relief is only available for refurbishment or conversion work (not for &ldquo;new build&rdquo;) that is carried out during the qualifying period which runs from 5 May 2015 to 4 May 2020 for the commercial element. To conform to EU State Aid de minimis guidelines, a cap is imposed on the amount of capital expenditure that can qualify for relief at the accelerated rate provided for under the scheme.</p><p>Property developers or connected persons are precluded from obtaining relief under the commercial element of the scheme where either the property developer or the connected person incurred the capital expenditure on the refurbishment or conversion of the premises or it was incurred by some other person connected with the property developer. The restriction on the offset of unused current year capital allowances against other income of &euro;31,750 applies to individual passive investors (investors who are not actively engaged in the business). Additionally, in the case of passive investors, any unused capital allowances under this scheme which are carried forward beyond the tax life (the period within which the allowances can be transferred to a subsequent owner) of the building to which they relate, are immediately lost. The property relief surcharge may apply to certain claimants under the commercial element of the scheme and relief is not available for any part of expenditure consisting of grants from the State or other State bodies.</p><p><b>Industrial Buildings Allowances &ndash; Aviation Services Facilities</b></p><p>Finance Act 2013 introduced a scheme of accelerated capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of certain specialist buildings and structures for use in the maintenance, repair or overhaul of commercial aircraft. The relief applies to buildings or structures in use for the purposes of such operations at all airports within the State. Relief for capital expenditure incurred is given via industrial buildings allowances at a rate of 15% per annum over 6 years and 10% in year 7. To qualify for relief under the scheme capital expenditure must be incurred during the qualifying period which runs from 13 October 2015 to 12 October 2020. To conform to EU State Aid de minimis guidelines, a cap is imposed on the amount of capital expenditure that can qualify for relief at the accelerated rate provided for under the scheme. Additionally, capital expenditure which is not specified capital expenditure can qualify for capital allowances at the standard rate of 4% per annum over 25 years providing it is incurred on or after 13 October 2015. </p><p>Capital expenditure will not be regarded as specified capital expenditure for the purposes of claiming accelerated allowances under the aviation services facilities scheme where the relevant interest is held by a property developer or a person connected with a property developer and the capital expenditure on the construction or refurbishment is incurred by either of those persons or by some other person connected with the property developer. The restriction on the offset of unused current year capital allowances against other income of &euro;31,750 applies to individual passive investors (investors who are not actively engaged in the business). Additionally, in the case of passive investors, any unused capital allowances under this scheme which are carried forward beyond the tax life (the period within which the allowances can be transferred to a subsequent owner) of the building to which they relate, are immediately lost. The property relief surcharge may apply to certain claimants under the scheme and relief is not available for any part of expenditure consisting of grants from the State or other State bodies. However, where such grant assistance has been received the capital expenditure may still qualify for capital allowances at the standard rate of 4% per annum net of any grants.</p><p><b>Industrial Buildings Allowances &ndash; Area Based Property Incentive Schemes</b></p><p>These schemes are now terminated i.e the periods during which qualifying expenditure could be incurred to avail of industrial buildings allowances under the schemes have expired. However, allowances may continue to be written off in some cases. </p></reply>

These decisions are the responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.

In this regard, it is important to note that there are no changes to the rights of a borrower whose loan is sold by a bank. All terms and conditions attached to their mortgage contract remain in place. In addition, Start Mortgages, the purchaser of the PTSB loan book, is a retail credit firm regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland since 2008. </p><p>When dealing with borrowers, retail credit firms are bound by the same regulations that currently apply to PTSB.  Like PTSB, they are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code (CPC) and the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) when dealing with borrowers who are in arrears</p><p>I should also highlight that regardless of the protections that are currently in place for mortgage holders, I have confirmed that I am prepared to engage with Deputies from other parties in an effort to see if these protections can be strengthened further in a sensible manner. This commitment has been demonstrated recently by the Government&rsquo;s support for the Bill introduced by Deputy Michael McGrath, T.D., which seeks to regulate the purchasers of mortgage loans.</p><p>In addition, earlier this year I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible.  I have asked for the report to be completed as soon as is practicable. The Central Bank has stated that it is their intention to deliver the report by the end of September 2018. If as a result of this review, the CCMA requires amendment, a full public consultation process would be required in line with normal guidelines. </p></reply>

Therefore, the protections of the CCMA only apply to buy-to-let mortgages if the residential property is the only residential property in the State owned by the borrower.</p><p>Provision 41 on the CCMA provides that the lender must not require the <b>borrower </b>to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type, as part of any alternative repayment arrangement offered to the <b>borrower</b>, except in the circumstances set out in Provision 46. (Please see attached link: )</p><p>Provision 46 provides that, in the case of an existing tracker mortgage, if following consideration of the options in accordance with Provision 39, in conjunction with Provision 41, the lender concludes that none of the option(s) that would allow the borrower to retain his/her tracker interest rate<b></b>is/are appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances, the lender may, but only as a last resort, offer the borrower an alternative repayment arrangement which requires the borrower<b></b>to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another mortgage type, if that alternative repayment arrangement: </p><p>a) is affordable for the borrower, and </p><p>b) is a long-term sustainable solution which is consistent with Central Bank of Ireland policy on sustainability. </p><p>For mortgages in arrears that do not fall within the scope of the CCMA, (e.g. buy-to-let properties which are not the only residential property in the State owned by the borrower), the provisions of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) apply.  </p><p>Under the Code there are clear obligations on lenders to act in the best interests of customers, to disclose relevant material information to customers and/or to bring key items or key information to the attention of customers. Further, the Code sets out specific requirements in respect of the treatment of personal customers exiting tracker rate mortgages. (Chapter 6 Provision 6.9 &ndash; 6.11 of the 2012 Code: ).</p><p>With respect to arrears resolution, the Code requires a lender to seek to agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears. However, it does not specifically prevent a lender from removing or amending a tracker rate on a buy-to-let mortgage in arrears. </p><p>As Minister for Finance I have not been made aware of any specific examples of the practice the Deputy refers to. If the Deputy is aware of such instances of banks removing persons that are in mortgage arrears from their tracker mortgage that are in breach of either the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears or the Consumer Protection Code 2012  then I would urge the Deputy to bring this information to the attention of the Central Bank.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Central Bank&rsquo;s Tracker Mortgage Examination requires all lenders, which offered tracker interest rate mortgages to their customers, to review all mortgage accounts, including accounts in arrears, to identify any tracker related failings both from a contractual and transparency perspective.  </p><p>The Central Bank provided a comprehensive update on the Tracker Mortgage Examination in April 2018, which is available at: .  </p></reply>

This represents one of the largest investment commitments by ISIF in any sector, alongside more than &euro;850m of external co-investment capital. These investments are, in all cases, focused on new housing supply and therefore on making much needed additional supply available to purchase and rent. Collectively, ISIF&rsquo;s investments are expected to support the supply of 15,000 new homes by 2021, with to date specific funding commitments made by ISIF platforms for over 3,500 residential units. All such housing projects financed by ISIF capital include, in line with the wider market, an element of both Part V housing and, in the case of rental properties, Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) tenancies.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, ISIF is required by legislation to ensure that all of its investments meet both commercial criteria and are off-balance sheet from the Exchequer perspective.  In that context, investment in social housing supply is particularly challenging, although ISIF continues to engage intensively with the market to examine the potential for social housing investment that is both commercial and off-balance sheet.</p>  <p>  ISIF&rsquo;s contribution therefore, in line with its mandate, is focused particularly on helping to overcome barriers to new housing supply, particularly through the provision of equity for investments that may not otherwise happen, and in this way is helping, as part of a wider range of Government policies and actions, to narrow the gap between housing supply and housing demand which is at the heart of both access and affordability issues.</p>  <p>  On July 4th 2018, following extensive review, the Government decided to refocus ISIF funds on the priorities that will support Project Ireland 2040 and have a more direct and positive impact on the economy&rsquo;s long-term growth potential. Housing supply is one of the identified priorities. The reallocations of ISIF funds requires the passage of legislation, including the legislation establishing Home Building Finance Ireland for which &euro;750 million of the original ISIF fund has been earmarked. On foot of the recent Government Decision, I will soon be writing to the Chief Executive of the NTMA to request that ISIF prepare the necessary proposals to operationalise the decision for my consideration.  My officials have already held discussions with ISIF so as to allow it to begin preparatory work on the refocused investment strategy.</p></reply>

However, in accordance with section 97(2K) TCA 1997, those restrictions do not apply where in the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019, a landlord rents residential premises for a period of 3 years to a tenant who is in receipt of certain social housing supports.  In such a case, when computing taxable rents from the property in question, the landlord may deduct the full amount of loan interest accruing in that 3-year period in respect of money borrowed to purchase, improve or repair that property.</p>  <p>  In effect, the amount of the interest accrued in each year of the 3-year period is rolled-up and treated as accruing on the day after the 3-year period ends.  Relief for this rolled-up interest is then obtained by way of a claim to Revenue after the end of the period.  Revenue advise me that the interest deduction is claimed on the landlord&rsquo;s tax return.  If the individual is non-resident for the year of assessment, the tax return requires details of the foreign tax identification number to be provided.  </p>  <p>  Revenue further advise me that to qualify for relief under section 97(2K) TCA 1997, the landlord must submit a Declaration of Undertaking Form to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  The undertaking commits the landlord to letting the relevant property to a qualifying tenant for the 3-year period and must be submitted at the same time as the tenancy is required to be registered in accordance with section 134 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (i.e. within 1 month of the start of the tenancy).</p></reply>

It operates in a similar manner to other withholding taxes including those in place in respect of share dividends and certain professional services.  </p>  <p>  A paper based withholding system was in place until 1 January 2012, when the electronic RCT (eRCT) system was introduced.  The electronic system streamlined the administration of RCT, reduced the opportunity for fraud, improved the cash-flow position of compliant subcontractors and significantly reduced the compliance burden for persons operating the tax.  For example, eRCT eliminates more than 1 million paper returns annually, reducing the cost of compliance to business by an estimated &euro;85 million.  In addition, Revenue uses the data collected through the eRCT system to pre-populate annual tax return forms thereby further assisting taxpayers to meet their obligations while also reducing compliance costs. </p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that the eRCT system is a flexible, user-friendly tool that can easily link in with other software packages that Principal Contractors can use to manage their own financial affairs as well as fulfil their RCT obligations.  Revenue has also confirmed that the eRCT system is supported by extensive published guidance and it should not be necessary for taxpayers to engage a tax agent to operate it.</p></reply>

The Central Bank indicates that the charge attached to calling their 1890 numbers is dependent on the mobile phone provider, specifically in the case of those using pre-pay bundles.

This included evaluating new telephony technology which could provide a robust, reliable and scalable telephone service (Revenue received approx. 2.5m calls per year) without relying on 1890 architecture.  Revenue is now in a position to begin rolling out new technology for its telephone service by the end of 2018/early 2019 using &lsquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)&rsquo; based telephony.

As part of the policy to encourage decommissioning of such vessels, this extended the terms of CGT retirement relief for those receiving such compensation under the scheme and lengthened the time over which recipients of such relief could pay balancing charges for capital allowances on vessels.  At the time of the passing of the Act, the introduction of the relief was subject to a commencement order to be signed by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  </p>  <p>  I understand that Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme 2014-20 provided for the implementation of a scheme to incentivise the permanent decommissioning of fishing vessels in certain imbalanced fleet segments.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara commissioned consultants to carry out a cost benefit analysis study of the proposed scheme.  The consultants concluded that while the proposal could have a positive return, they recommended against a decommissioning scheme proceeding, as they considered that there was a significant risk that the benefits of the scheme would be eroded by use of the decommissioning premiums to fund re-entry to the fleet using off-register fleet capacity.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine sought solutions to this issue with representatives of the fishing industry, but no legally robust solutions were identified.  I understand that there was also a number of legal and State Aid obstacles to resolving the off-register obstacle. </p>  <p>  As a result I believe that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine concluded that a decommissioning scheme could not proceed.  Under the EMFF Regulation, Permanent Cessation schemes were no longer permitted after 31 December, 2017.

The relief was limited to a maximum of 50% of the trading profits for each accounting period.  This restriction was removed in Finance Bill 2013 as it was considered to have outlasted its initial purpose.  Due to the substantial holdings that the State had subsequently acquired in the banking sector (99.8% of AIB and 15% of Bank of Ireland at the time) it was deemed to be acting against the State&rsquo;s interests.  Section 396C was repealed to reduce the State&rsquo;s role as a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; provider of capital and to improve the existing value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the losses carried forward it should be noted that the Irish banks do currently pay some Irish corporation tax, as the losses do not shelter profits made in all their corporate entities in Ireland.  The banks are also contributing to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy.  To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016.  In Budget 2016, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021.  The bank levy is expected to raise &euro;750 million over those five years.</p>  <p>  At Committee Stage of Finance Act 2017, I agreed that my officials would produce a report on the potential effect of limiting the provision of tax relief for losses carried forward for banks.  This report has recently been provided to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  The paper examines the potential re-introduction of the tax loss restriction for the NAMA-participating banks, among other options, and estimates that such a measure could potentially result in an annual Exchequer yield of approximately &euro;111 million in respect of the remaining NAMA-participating banks, assuming no change to the bank levy.</p>  <p>  The report also notes that a range of consequential impacts would have to be considered in connection which such a measure.  A restriction targeted at some or all banks in Ireland could be expected to increase costs and/or reduce competition in the sector.  This could have negative knock-on effects to the detriment of consumers, including mortgage holders, business borrowers and savers.</p>  <p>  Such a change would have an impact on the capital position of the banks in which the State has a shareholding and the report estimates that an immediate reduction in value of the State&rsquo;s shareholdings of in excess of &euro;400 million could be expected to occur.  It would also have the potential to damage the State&rsquo;s credibility in the international markets, and this could have negative consequences for values achieved in future share sales.  </p>  <p>  These factors would need to be considered carefully in framing future policy with regard to relief for trading losses in the banking sector.</p></reply>

The report favoured the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this recommendation was accepted by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Thornhill Group concluded that the arguments for SVT were outweighed by the likely difficulties in ensuring acceptance by taxpayers, i.e., arriving at values that were evidence based, understandable and acceptable to the public in addition to complexities and uncertainties in the valuation effort necessary to put an SVT in place.  In contrast, the Group considered that under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood.  There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the properties. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Minister for Finance, the operation of the LPT was reviewed in 2015 by Dr. Thornhill.  A number of submissions to the review favoured changing the basis of determination of LPT liabilities to site value, floor area or variations thereof.  Dr. Thornhill considered these but remained of the view that market value is the most appropriate and equitable basis on which to determine LPT liabilities.</p>  <p>  Both Commissions on Taxation in 1985 and 2009 favoured property taxation based on market value citing inter alia significant difficulties in communicating to home-owners and land-holders the nature of the taxation charge that is involved and the benefits that would accrue from that change. </p>  <p>  At my request the Department of Finance is currently finalising a review of the LPT in conjunction with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Housing Planning and Local Government and the Taoiseach and the Revenue Commissioners.  The review is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments and includes a consultation process to enable all interested parties and individuals to submit their views on the future of the LPT.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce a Site Value Tax.</p></reply>

Information for 2017 will be published in 2019 when Corporation Tax returns for the year have been analysed. </p><p>On the matter of the effective corporate tax rate paid by corporations in Ireland, the Deputy will be aware that there have been seemingly conflicting figures and methodologies used in reference to Ireland.  Therefore in 2014, my Department prepared and presented a report for the Finance Committee to explain figures which are quoted and attributed to Ireland on this matter.  This technical paper, co-authored by an independent academic, provides clarity on the matter and is available online via the following link: <i>. </i></p><p>Based on data from the Central Statistics Office and Revenue, this technical paper highlighted that, from 2003, the effective corporate tax rates on Net Operating Surplus and Taxable Income averaged 10.9% and 10.7% respectively.  While these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the availability of the small number of targeted tax measures that are available in Ireland that may lower the effective rate of corporation tax paid in Ireland. </p><p>Furthermore, the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s (C&amp;amp;AG) Report Annual Report for 2016 highlighted that 79 of the top 100 companies paid an effective rate of 10% or more, and almost two-thirds paid in excess of 12%.</p><p>It is important to note that, of the companies which paid less than an effective rate of 10%, in most of these cases the relevant company was in receipt of foreign dividends for which double tax relief was available for taxes incurred in other jurisdictions in respect of that income.  Therefore, when foreign taxes are factored in, the rate of tax was substantially higher.</p><p>In a number of cases, the effective corporate tax rate was also impacted by R&amp;amp;D tax credit claims.  The R&amp;amp;D tax credit is one of the few reliefs we have which may lower the effective rate of corporate tax paid in Ireland.  Some other countries have higher headline rates, supplemented by a high number of tax reliefs, which reduce the overall tax paid.  In contrast, Ireland&rsquo;s approach is transparent.  We have a competitive headline rate of corporate tax applied to a broad base.  Of the small number incentives we have, these are focused on the creation of additional employment and on areas of innovation. </p><p>Further work carried out by Revenue has identified that the effective rate of tax paid by companies in 2015 was provisionally 9.8%, which was a marginal increase on the 2014 rate of 9.7%.  The 2012 and 2013 figures are 10.1%.  Again, while these percentages are lower than the 12.5% headline rate, this can be attributed to the small number of targeted tax measures available in Ireland.</p><p>On the basis of this extensive analysis, I am satisfied that companies in Ireland are paying the appropriate rate of corporate tax on profits generated by those companies in Ireland.</p></reply>

A major contributor to this progress has been the number of mortgage restructures the banks have agreed with their customers.  There are currently over 137,000 mortgage restructures in place covering both owner occupied and buy-to-let facilities. </p>  <p>  Despite this progress, the NPL ratios of the Irish banks remain at an elevated level and are well above the European average of c. 4%. Permanent TSB (PTSB) is a particular outlier in this regard with a ratio of c. 25%, before the recent loan sale (Project Glas) took place. Given this position, the banking regulatory authorities have tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy with the expectation that they will reduce their NPL ratio towards the European average within a defined time period.</p>  <p>  The decisions around the content of these strategies are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks themselves and the banking regulatory authorities have not mandated any specific actions. </p>  <p>  With regards to the second part of your question, a number of Parliamentary Questions have been answered in the past in relation to rules adopted by banks when valuing assets including loans. These rules are determined by the relevant accounting standards and it is the responsibility of the directors of the respective banks to ensure these rules have been properly applied. To provide assurance that this is the case, the proper application of the rules is subject to an annual independent external audit review.? ?</p>  <p>  Nothing has been brought to my attention to suggest that these rules have not been correctly applied by the banks. Notwithstanding this, should the Deputy have concerns in this regard, she may wish to refer such concerns to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), the independent body responsible for the examination and enforcement of certain listed entities' financial reporting.  ?</p>  <p>  Finally, the requirement for banks to prepare financial statements is laid out in the Companies Acts. The Companies Acts come under the scope of the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation. The Director of Corporate Enforcement has widespread powers and functions in relation to potential breaches of the Companies Acts.?</p></reply>

Firstly, the inherited house must have been the deceased person&rsquo;s principal private residence at the date of his or her death. This requirement is relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home. In addition, the beneficiary must not have a beneficial interest in another residential property. Finally, the beneficiary must have lived in the house for 3 years prior to the date of the inheritance and must continue to live in the house for 6 years after the date of the inheritance. </p>  <p>  A transfer of a house for no consideration is treated as a gift. With one exception, it is not possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house. The exception is where a person gifts a dwelling house to a &lsquo;dependent relative&rsquo;. For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. If a beneficiary qualifies as a &lsquo;dependent relative&rsquo; then there is no requirement that the house be the principal private residence of the deceased person or the donor or that the beneficiary remain in the house for 6 years after the date of the gift or inheritance.</p>  <p>  The same treatment applies in relation to a part of a building as it does to an entire building, provided that the part of the building involved was used as a dwelling house, or was suitable for such use, and meets the qualifying conditions for the exemption in its own right: for example, a &lsquo;granny flat&rsquo; that forms part of a house or an individual apartment in an apartment block.</p>  <p>  Stamp duty</p>  <p>  The transfer of a property that is a family home, or part of a family home, to a son or daughter constitutes a conveyance on sale for the purposes of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999. Stamp duty is payable by the transferee, whether or not it was transferred by way of sale or gift. Where a property is sold, or otherwise transferred, for less than market value, section 30 SDCA 1999 imposes a charge to stamp duty at the market value of the property.</p>  <p>  Stamp duty on transfers of residential property is chargeable at the rate of 1% where the consideration does not exceed &euro;1 million. Where the consideration exceeds &euro;1 million, stamp duty is chargeable at 1% on the first &euro;1 million and 2% on the balance in excess of &euro;1 million. </p>  <p>  Capital gains tax</p>  <p>  The transfer of a family home to a son or daughter is exempt from capital gains tax if the property was the main family residence for the period of the parent&rsquo;s ownership.</p></reply>

These reports demonstrated that PCP finance has grown considerably in recent years and is becoming an increasingly important source of finance for the purchase of new cars. While the availability of such credit is important for the finance and motor industries, it is also important that the level of information and protections available to consumers in relation to such products continues to be robust.</p>  <p>  Following on from these publications, I commissioned Mr. Michael Tutty, a former Regulator and Second Secretary in the Department of Finance, to carry out an independent review of the current PCP market and regulatory structure to see if there are any particular consumer protection gaps which may need to be addressed. As part of his work Mr. Tutty has consulted both the Central Bank and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission along with a number of other key stakeholders. I expect to receive Mr Tutty's report very shortly and I will then consider the report and any recommendations it may contain.</p></reply>

This cost is based on claims in respect of Entrepreneur Relief that were included in 2016 tax returns and does not take account of any potential behavioural change.</p></reply>

The VAT Directive provides that VAT registration thresholds may only be raised by Member States to maintain their value in real terms, that is, they may only be increased in line with inflation.  Our VAT thresholds were increased to their current values, &euro;37,500 for services and &euro;75,000 for goods, on 1 May 2008 and as the Central Statistics Office figures show the consumer price index is below the level it reached in 2008, therefore it is not possible to increase these thresholds. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s VAT registration thresholds for small enterprises and the self-employed are among the highest in the EU.

These include:</p><p>- simplified and electronic invoicing, </p><p>- special schemes for retailers and pharmacists, </p><p>- the facility to make VAT returns on a bi-annual or annual basis,</p><p>- the facility for small businesses to submit an annual VIES return rather than monthly</p><p>- the cash receipts basis of accounting where the trader is not required to pay VAT until payment for the supply is received, and</p><p>- the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) which allows business to register, file and pay VAT due in all Member States through a single portal. </p></reply>

This shift in focus has been accompanied by a new strict definition Europe-wide of what constitutes an NPL by the European Banking Authority (EBA) which means that certain restructures are deemed NPL even if customers are meeting the revised payment schedule.  </p><p>Officials in my Department met with staff of the SSM at the highest level on two occasions since late 2016.  I also met Ms Nouy, Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB. In the course of these discussions my officials outlined the background and history to the restructuring effort in Ireland and questioned the logic of now classifying some types of restructured loans, including certain split mortgages, as NPL indefinitely.  While we have been informed that the SSM is looking into the regulatory treatment of split mortgages across a number of European member states I have no evidence at this point that this categorisation is going to change.  </p><p>I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that in 2014, the European Banking Authority (EBA) introduced harmonized definitions of forbearance and non-performing for supervisory reporting purposes (referred to as the ITS on forbearance and non-performing exposures).</p><p>Per the and the , non-performing exposures are those that satisfy either or both of the following criteria:</p><p>1.material exposures which are more than 90 days past-due;</p><p>2.the debtor is assessed as unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full without realisation of collateral, regardless of the existence of any past-due amount or of the number of days past due.&rdquo;</p><p>Exposures should be classified as non-performing and/or forborne if they meet the relevant criteria outlined in the EBA ITS.  In relation to curing, paragraph 157 outlines the criteria required for a non-performing forborne exposure to move back to performing status.  Restructured NPLs can migrate back to performing when the criteria outlined in the EBA ITS has been satisfied, and it is the bank&rsquo;s responsibility to conduct that assessment.  Depending on the specificities of the restructure, it can take at least a year for a restructured NPL to move back to performing status.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm.  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm. Under the 2015 Act, if the firm who bought loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a &lsquo;credit servicing firm&rsquo; which is regulated by the Central Bank.  Credit Servicing Firms are firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities. </p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013, and the SME Regulations.  Contractual terms are not changed by the sale of the loan.</p><p>Provision 3.11 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s (the Code) requires that, where a regulated lender intends to transfer all or part of its &lsquo;regulated activities&rsquo; to another regulated entity, it must provide advance notification to both the Central Bank and affected consumers.  Specifically, a lender must provide a consumer with at least 2 months&rsquo; notice before transferring all or part of its loan book covered by the Code to another person, including where the transferee is an unregulated entity. Where the transferee is an unregulated entity, the Code requires that the regulated lender also notify the consumer of the name of the regulated entity that will be &lsquo;servicing&rsquo; the loan for the unregulated entity.  In the event that there is a change in the credit servicing firm, the existing credit servicing firm must also notify the Central Bank and the consumer in advance, in accordance with the timelines set out under Provision 3.11 of the Code. Furthermore, I understand that the Central Bank expects all affected consumers to be informed of the term of their loan agreement which allows the loan to be sold and the identity and address of the new owner.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now titled the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2018 was considered by Select committee on 12 July. My officials worked with Deputy McGrath and other stakeholders to develop the Bill as initiated.  This Bill will require that loan owners are regulated by the Central Bank. I expect that Report Stage will be taken after the summer recess.</p><p>I have also asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to ensure it remains as effective as possible and for the review to be completed as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The SBCI achieves this aim through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk sharing activities supporting the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to SMEs. </p><p>The SBCI does not lend directly. Rather, the SBCI operates through its partner finance providers, known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank and four non-bank on-lenders: AIB; Bank of Ireland; Ulster Bank; First Citizen Finance; Finance Ireland; Bibby Financial Services Ireland and FEXCO Asset Finance.<b></b></p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland commenced on-lending in March 2015. To the end of March 2018, the SBCI has supported loans through both its on-lending and risk-sharing activities, totaling &euro;952m to 23,867 Irish SMEs supporting 122,227 jobs.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors, and they are spread across every region of the country. </p><p>The SBCI is currently seeking to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage thereby serving to meet the needs of Irish SMEs and drive competition in the SME finance market.  The SBCI continues to work on developing new innovative products, such as the Brexit Loan Scheme, which was launched in March 2018.  This &euro;300m scheme is designed to provide funding support to enable eligible Irish businesses to implement necessary changes to address the challenges posed by Brexit. Additionally, the SBCI is also continuing to work on a number of other initiatives, including the continued use of guarantees and risk sharing schemes to support lending by finance providers.  These aim to address recognised market failures and improve the risk appetite of partner finance providers.</p><p>Chronological Table of SBCI Funds and Guarantees Committed to On-Lenders<table><tr><th>Date </th><th>On Lender</th><th>Liquidity (Funds)</th><th>Risk Sharing (Guarantees Provided)</th></tr><tr><td>Dec-14 </td><td>Bank of Ireland</td><td>&euro;200m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Feb-15 </td><td>Allied Irish Bank</td><td>&euro;200m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Oct-15 </td><td>Finance Ireland</td><td>&euro;51m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Nov-15 </td><td>Merrion Fleet</td><td>&euro;25m* </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Nov-15 </td><td>Allied Irish Bank</td><td>&euro;200m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dec-15 </td><td>Ulster Bank</td><td>&euro;75m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>May-16 </td><td>First Citizen Agri Finance</td><td>&euro;40m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jun-16 </td><td>Bibby Financial Services Ireland</td><td>&euro;45m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Nov-16 </td><td>Fexco Asset Finance</td><td>&euro;70m </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jan-17 </td><td>Bank of Ireland</td><td></td><td>&euro;65m </td></tr><tr><td>Jan-17 </td><td>Allied Irish Bank</td><td></td><td>&euro;60m </td></tr><tr><td>Jan-17 </td><td>Ulster Bank</td><td></td><td>&euro;25m </td></tr><tr><td>Mar-18 </td><td>Bank of Ireland</td><td></td><td>&euro;128m </td></tr><tr><td>Mar-18 </td><td>Allied Irish Bank</td><td></td><td>&euro;122m </td></tr><tr><td>Mar-18 </td><td>Ulster Bank</td><td></td><td>&euro;50m </td></tr><tr><td>May-18 </td><td>Bibby Financial Services Ireland</td><td>&euro;25m </td><td></td></tr></table>*Facility closed in July 2017 following the sale of Merrion Fleet to Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale</p><p>SBCI liquidity funding remains available through Finance Ireland, First Citizen, Bibby Financial Services Ireland and Fexco Asset Finance.  </p><p>Risk-sharing activities totaling &euro;450m were provided via the &euro;150m Agricultural Cashflow Loan Scheme launched in January 2017 and more recently through the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme launched in March 2018.  </p><p>The SBCI&rsquo;s lending to SMEs is largely driven by market demands and needs that are not fully met by the private sector.  The Deputy can rest assured that the SBCI is working to develop a more diverse range of on-lenders and innovative products.  This will enable it to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage, meet the evolving requirements of the SME finance market and contribute to a sustainable and competitive economy in the medium to long term</p></reply>

This includes decisions in relation to rejection rates as determined by the banks.</p><p>However, the Government is concious of the important role SMEs play in our economy.  In this regard, my Department commissions biannual surveys to ascertain the demand for credit by SMEs, as well as related issues.  The SME Credit Demand Survey, October 2017 &ndash; March 2018, which was published last Monday, 27th August, shows that bank rejection rates have decreased for micro SMEs.  The latest SME Credit Demand Survey report shows that refusal rates amongst micro companies have decreased to 16% in March 2018 from 21% in March 2017, while small and medium-sized businesses seeking finance have also indicated higher levels of approval rates.  The survey shows that in total, 88% of all applications for the past six months (excluding &ldquo;still pending&rdquo;) have been approved in full/partially, similar to March 2017.  Longitudinally, the Credit Demand Survey shows that overall rejection rates for SMEs have been reducing since the begining of the series, from 23% in March 2012 to 12% in March 2018. </p><p>The SME Credit Demand Surveys is currently conducted by Fitzpatrick Associates in conjunction with Behaviour and Attitudes, on behalf of the Department.  It is the most comprehensive survey of SME Credit Demand in Ireland, covering over 1,500 respondents through in-depth discussions.  The survey ensures that it captures a full picture of the SME landscape in Ireland, with micro enterprises, small-sized enterprises and medium-sized enterprises accurately represented as per the percentage make-up of SMEs in Ireland.  </p><p>The SME Credit Demand Survey is available at <i>.</i></p></reply>

To the extent that the US rules prevent companies from achieving globally low effective tax rates, this change is to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  Naturally, US tax reform is of great interest to Ireland given the large volume of US investment here.  Foreign Direct Investment has been a key contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s economic development and growth.  It has provided rewarding employment for over 300,000 people directly and a transformation of the enterprise base in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The level of investment from the US into Ireland cannot be attributed just to corporate tax policy &ndash; that is not a fair reflection of the many other reasons that companies choose to locate in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Factors such as availability of physical and technological infrastructure, availability of skilled staff, access to the EU market as well as culture and quality of life are also significant and important considerations.</p>  <p>  US business will always want to have operations in the EU, and Ireland will remain very competitive and attractive as an EU location to invest in and do business from. US multinationals locating real substantial activity in Ireland will continue to be subject to Irish tax at 12.5% on their profits properly attributable to activity located in Ireland.</p>  <p>  BEAT and other measures have been critically received internationally, by the OECD, European Commission and larger EU Member States.</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance, and the Irish Embassy in the US, will continue to monitor the situation regarding US Tax reform and will continue to engage with business and others to fully understand the potential impacts of the changes in the US.</p></reply>

The construction industry accounts for approximately 7.4 per cent of GDP. For comparison, in 2007 it accounted for 18.6 per cent. In terms of labour supply, workers in the construction industry account for 6.3 per cent of all workers. In 2007, they accounted for 10.6 per cent. Overall, the contribution of construction to the economy is expected to grow with the Department forecasting this to rise to 9.7 per cent of GDP by 2021. The rise is consistent with delivery of the National Development Plan as well as the much needed increase in housing supply. An increase of this magnitude in the overall contribution of construction to the broader economy is both sustainable and desirable given our investment requirements. I also note the results of the recent Quarterly Labour Force Survey showing that the construction sector gained 17,800 employees over the year to Q2 2018, the largest sectoral increase for the period. While there may be a shortage of labour with specific skill sets there does not appear to be a more generalised labour supply problem in the construction industry.</p>  <p>  I am nevertheless aware that specific pressures exist.  A report by SOLAS earlier this year entitled &ldquo;Overview of Construction Sector Skills&rdquo; identified skill shortages in the sector.  It also outlined the Agency&rsquo;s response, which includes a very significant increase in apprenticeships. </p>  <p>  Separately, the issue of land price inflation is another matter that my Department continues to monitor.  While there are no official data on residential development land prices, reports on construction costs, including land prices, have been published by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as well as by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government report specifically looks at the drivers of land price inflation. </p>  <p>  To help tackle land price inflation - and housing inflation more generally - the Government introduced the Vacant Site Levy.  The levy aims to encourage land owners to either develop their sites or sell them to those who will.  The Vacant Site Levy presents a strong disincentive to land hoarding.  In addition, in Budget 2018 I increased the rate of stamp duty on non-residential property from 2 per cent to 6 per cent with a view to refocusing construction activity.  Finally, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is finalising proposals around the new State land management agency, which will maximise the use of State land as well enter partnerships with private land owners to ensure strategically important land banks are used efficiently.</p></reply>

To this end, co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being taken forward through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and on 18 July the T&aacute;naiste presented a Memorandum to the Government on Brexit Preparedness and Contingency Planning.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, was identified as an early priority and is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. </p>  <p>  My Department, along with the Revenue Commissioners, is actively engaged in this planning work which has intensified in recent months and is now well advanced. The planning, as appropriate, includes any specific responses necessary according to regional needs and at the county level.</p>  <p>  This work has provided baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations. This is enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement, including a transitional arrangement, is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  On the basis of this work, relevant Departments have now been tasked by the Government to rollout detailed Action Plans with a view to advancing, as appropriate, the mitigating measures which have been identified in the areas of their responsibility from the planning to the implementation phase.</p>  <p>  In line with this approach, the Government has already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focused on East-West trade and by the end of September, detailed and costed plans will be presented to Government on additional full time customs staff to carry out relevant controls at ports and airports; and upgrading of infrastructure at ports and airports, in particular Dublin and Rosslare Ports, to facilitate increased customs and SPS controls.</p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s priority to date has been on upgrading relevant IT systems to have the most advanced systems possible to support and facilitate smooth and efficient trade flows. Performance testing is well advanced and I am assured by Revenue that based on the work completed to date they are confident that the various IT systems will support the expected additional work load arising from Brexit, ensuring customs processes can continue to operate effectively and efficiently post-Brexit.</p></reply>

The primary policy areas for the Department relate to the economic and financial sector implications stemming from Brexit.  This work is being undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework coordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and is vital to guaranteeing Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected in the negotiation process to ensure that any adverse impacts on our economy are minimised.</p>  <p>  The Department undertakes a rolling analysis which focusses on the key Brexit related policy issues, which includes taxation. The issue of VAT and Brexit was analysed in four papers as part of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) in 2017 and 2018. (TSG 17-06 &ndash; Selected VAT Issues, TSG 17-09 &ndash; BREXIT Taxation Issues, TSG 18-05 &ndash; VAT Issues and TSG 18-08 &ndash; Brexit). </p>  <p>  The papers identify the rules governing the European Value Added Tax System for goods and services within the VAT Directive (2006/112/EC) to which all 28 EU Member States must adhere and notes that post Brexit, the UK will no longer operate within those EU frameworks. This change has a number of implications for business and consumers.</p>  <p>  Like all Government agencies, the Revenue Commissioners are also actively engaged in examining a range of scenarios in order to support Ireland's objectives.  However, until the shape of post-Brexit arrangements becomes clear, it will not be possible to formulate specific plans.</p>  <p>  There remains a large level of uncertainty in the UK position and the precise future arrangements for taxation shall depend on the outcome of future relationship negotiations between the EU and United Kingdom, and those discussions are currently ongoing.</p></reply>

This guidance incorporates key elements of EU legislation that have been transposed into Irish law and is complemented by circulars and guidance issued by this Department and the Office of Government Procurement. </p><p>The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p><p>Under the EU Directives governing public procurement, contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5.548 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;144,000 and for local authorities and non-central bodies the threshold is &euro;221,000. In the case of contracts below the threshold levels, the Treaty principles of proportionality, transparency, non-discrimination etc. apply where there is the potential for cross-border interest.  Under national rules, all contracts for works and works-related services over &euro;50,000 and over &euro;25,000 for supplies and general services must be advertised on the national public procurement website www.etenders.gov.ie.  Contracts below these thresholds, should be awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers. </p><p>The eTenders website is for use by the wider public sector including semi-state bodies, both commercial and non-commercial.  Voluntary and community groups which are publicly funded are also entitled to use the site for their procurement activity.  Registration on eTenders is free and there is no charge to submit a tender.  Contractors can register as a &lsquo;Supplier&rsquo; on the eTenders system.  As part of the registration process a contractor should select the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) codes that describe the type of works that they are interested in tendering for.  This will ensure that they receive an automatic notification email alert when contracting authorities publish contract notices on eTenders for public works of a type that they select.  The form for eTenders supplier registration can be found at .</p><p>Where tenders are invited in this manner it is incumbent on contracting authorities to ensure that those who are awarded public contracts have the financial standing and technical capacity to complete the works in a safe and timely manner.  </p><p>Bodies procuring public works projects must comply with the provisions of the CWMF which contains extensive guidance covering all aspects of the procurement and contract administration stages.  Specific guidance and templates are also published to manage the pre-qualification stage of a procurement process.  It is important, when assessing the financial standing and technical capacity of a contractor to undertake a particular project, that the contracting authority should set standards that are proportionate to the project and its associated risks.</p><p>To provide targeted assistance to contracting authorities on this important stage of the procurement process guidance note GN 2.3.1.3 - Minimum Standards for Suitability Works Contractor Criteria (Open, Restricted Procedure) was first published on 6 October 2010.</p><p>This guidance note sets out standards under each of the criteria that may be used to assess a contractor&rsquo;s financial standing and technical ability.  The guidance was developed in consultation with industry at a point where the recession had commenced and took into account reduced capacity generally.  The guidance was revised in May 2013, primarily to reflect changes in the requirements for performance bonds on public works projects.</p><p>Turnover represents a reasonable indicator of the capacity of a contractor to deliver projects of a particular scale.  Construction projects require main contractors to manage a significant supply chain and where turnover is lower than recommended levels contracting authorities are entitled to have legitimate concerns over the capacity of a contractor to deliver the project in question.</p><p>Guidance note GN 2.3.1.3 (page 11) states that, for building projects, turnover should be set within a range of 75 &ndash; 150% of the annualised turnover of the capital value of the contract which is the capital value of the project divided by the number of years over which the expenditure will occur.  For a straightforward building project of 2 years duration with a capital value of &euro;4m the turnover sought can be as low as &euro;1.5m.  For general civil engineering projects this is reduced to 30 &ndash; 60% but rises to 200 &ndash; 300% of the annualised turnover of the capital value for complex civil engineering rail projects.</p><p>The 2014 procurement directives set a cap on the level of turnover at a maximum of two times the estimated contract value except in duly justified cases.  The ranges set out above result in turnover levels that are well below this cap with the exception of the range specified for complex rail projects which, because of their exceptionally high risk, is justified.</p></reply>

A link to the report follows.  </p></reply>

Insofar as pension increases are concerned, the main function of my Department is to determine, subject to appropriate Ministerial and Government approval, the pensions increase policy to apply, and to issue Circulars to Departments and public service bodies to authorise and give guidance on the application of the relevant increases. It is then a matter for each pension paying authority to ensure that effect is given to the pension increases authorised in the relevant Circulars, in the present instance, those set out in Circular 02/2018.</p>  <p>  The principle of pay parity underlies the pension increases sanctioned in this Circular. This means that pay increases, agreed as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA), are to be passed on to pension recipients to bring the salary on which their pension is based up to the current salary of those still serving after the pay increases are applied. It is important to note that not all pension recipients will be due these increases. This is because of protections in place (known as &lsquo;grace periods&rsquo;) for public servants retiring after the application of pay cuts under the FEMPI legislation, whereby their pensions were calculated using the higher pay rates that were in effect prior to the application of the pay cuts.</p>  <p>  The administrative procedures for applying pay parity to pensions in payment, both in general and in the particular case of Circular 02/2018, are not straightforward. They require an examination of the salary on which an individual&rsquo;s pension was based and the salary of those still serving in the same grade and on the same payscale point after the pay increase is applied, which I am advised is largely a manual process. The grace periods to which I refer above, a valuable protection for the pension entitlements of the public servants concerned, inevitably impose an additional hurdle to be addressed in the application of pension increases.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the procedures I have described are inevitably complex and time-consuming, and that, as a result, not all pension increases will be capable of being paid on any one fixed date. </p>  <p>  As I mentioned in my earlier response, responsibility for implementing the increases, within the context of the administrative issues I have outlined above, lies with the various public service pension/payroll providers. I understand that work is underway to apply the 1 January 2018 pay increase, the first pension increase sanctioned in Circular 02/2018, to those qualifying pensions in payment that have not yet benefited from that increase, and that this will include the calculation and payment of arrears backdated as appropriate.</p></reply>

This approach is beneficial for the State because it nurtures competition which ensures value for money is maintained and provides SME with a platform to take advantage of similar opportunities in Ireland and across the European Union.   </p>  <p>  Specifically, the Office of Government Procurement have developed a suite of measures (circular 10/14) aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities. These include:</p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice contract value);</p>  <p>  - Contracting Authorities are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale;</p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal. </p>  <p>  In addition, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, ensuring that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) is heard by Government.  </p>  <p>  SMEs are also encouraged to register on the Government's eTenders portal. Suppliers that are registered and have expressed an interest in similar business opportunities will receive automatic notification when new opportunities arise.</p>  <p>  The OGP proactively engages with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Inter-Trade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote SME access to public procurement. The OGP participate at "Go-2-Tender" workshops and "Meet the Buyer" events which are also designed to help SMEs. </p>  <p>  A SME Communication Strategy sub-group, chaired by the OGP, was established in 2017 as a joint venture with the industry representative bodies.  This further promotes awareness of potential opportunities and supports available for SMEs in tendering for public contracts.  A series of information videos explaining specific public procurement topics, along with case studies of SMEs who have won government contracts, was launched by Minister of State O&rsquo;Donovan earlier this year.  A series of focused and targeted breakfast briefings have also been scheduled around the country in conjunction with Inter-Trade Ireland and the SME Advisory Group partners.</p>  <p>  Currently, data on the award of public contracts does not generally capture the size of businesses that are successful. However, analysis carried and published by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) in the "Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2015" indicates that 94% of government procurement expenditure analysed falls within the State. This was based on an analysis of &euro;4.535 billion expenditure across 86 large public service bodies.  Other key findings show that the majority of spend analysed is with SMEs. 76% of tender notices are smaller value (below OJEU threshold) tenders. The median contract value of 2015 tender notices is less than or equal to &euro;100k in 12 of the 16 procurement spend categories. This would indicate that government contracts in Ireland are accessible to SMEs given the low median size of published estimated contract values.</p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to proactively engage with business and strive to enhance the significant measures already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities.</p></reply>

The primary objective was to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all participants, attendees and staff.</p><p>The Office of Public Works managed the safety and logistics aspects of the visit in conjunction with An Garda Siochana.</p><p>Event Planning, equipment hire and the provision of security barriers was contracted through the OPW Event Management Services Procurement Framework. Under this Framework the following companies provided services:</p><p>- Actavo</p><p>- Arcana</p><p>- Catapult</p><p>- Eamon O'Boyle &amp;amp; Associates</p><p>- Pulse Security Management Ltd</p><p>- Eventsec</p><p>The final cost in this regard is not available as yet. However, I can advise that &euro;4.9million has been paid to date.</p><p>The Estimated attendance at the Papal Mass in the Phoenix Park was 150,000 people.</p><p>The overall final cost of the Papal Visit is not available as yet. Although the visit is over, the OPW continues to work on the logistical arrangements which includes the de-rig, reinstatement and post-event administration for venues and locations associated with the visit including Aras an Uachtarain, Dublin Castle, the Papal City Route, the Pro Cathedral, Capuchin Day Centre, Ireland West Airport, Knock Shrine, Phoenix Park, Media Centre Dublin Castle, Media Centre Phoenix Park, Media Centre Ireland West Airport, Media Centre Knock Shrine, Papal Visit Control Room - Dublin Castle.</p><p>OPW does not have any information in relation to the estimated economic benefit of the visit or the estimated economic impact on traffic restrictions on Dublin City during the visit.</p><p>OPW worked closely with all the agencies involved in the Papal Mass event to minimise the impact on the flora and fauna in the Phoenix Park. While some localised ground compaction occurred, as would be expected with an event of this scale, the overall effect on the flora and fauna of the Park was negligible.</p><p>With a view to minimising the impact of the event in the Phoenix Park on local residents and regular Park users, OPW implemented the following measures:</p><p>- Engaged dedicated Business and Community Liaison team.</p><p>- 26 July - 200 A4 Flyers and business cards distributed to City centre businesses.</p><p>- 8 and 9 August - Business Briefings in Printworks Dublin Castle. Attended by 140 businesses.</p><p>- 4 and 5 August - 400 x A3 full colour posters distributed.  Advance Notification of Community Briefing in The Castleknock Hotel.</p><p>- 10 August - Community Briefing at The Castleknock Hotel. Attended by 120 people.</p><p>- 14 - 21 August &ndash; An Post mail distribution of 144,000 booklets containing list of road closures, &lsquo;Dear Community&rsquo; letter and contact information. These were delivered to residents and businesses in the City to advise them of restrictions in place that may impact them in advance of and during the Papal Visit.  Copies of the booklet were also available from Dublin City Council,  Dublin Town Kiosks, local Garda stations and from the OPW offices in Phoenix Park.  </p><p>- 18 and 19 August - 60 x A3 full colour posters distributed in Smithfield, Stoneybatter and Navan Road areas re forthcoming community briefing.</p><p>- 20 August - 130 businesses and residents attended Community Briefing in Parish Hall, Prussia Street, Stoneybatter, D.7</p><p>- 20 - 27 August &ndash; Dedicated Papal Visit Helpline live in Dublin City Council.</p><p>- 23 August - 4,900 full colour A4 double-sided leaflets delivered to each of the seven designated pedestrian routes giving advance notification to residents and businesses of the large numbers of pedestrians expected to walk along these roads and the suspension of parking on their roads. </p><p>As described above, the process of de-rig, dismantling and removal of event infrastructure is ongoing in the Park and until complete, a costing for reinstatement of the Park cannot be provided. It is expected that these costs will be minimal. It is also expected that reinstatement works will be completed by the end of the year. </p><p>The organiser of the Papal Visit was the World Meeting of Families. No fees were charged.</p><p>In addition to the deployment of its own direct labour resources, the following contractors were engaged by the OPW in the Phoenix Park in relation to the Papal Visit:</p><p>- Actavo</p><p>- Ailesbury Ltd</p><p>- Catapult</p><p>- ETAV Ltd</p><p>- Eventus Ltd</p><p>- Total Event Hire</p><p>- Mongey Communications (Clardex Systems t/a Mongey Communications)</p><p>- Eventsec</p><p>- With Taste</p><p>- King Tree Services</p><p>- Garrido Limited</p><p>- Shaw Tree Services</p><p>- Darwin's Tree Services</p><p>- Peter O'Brien &amp;amp; Sons Landscapes</p><p>- Fleming &amp;amp; Co Signs</p><p>- Celtic Roadsweepers</p><p>- CFA Construction</p><p>- Conex Civil Engineering</p><p>- McLoughlin Line Marking Ltd</p><p>- Des Byrne Painting Contractors</p><p>- MC Decorators Ltd</p><p>- GMC Civil Engineering</p><p>- MP Decorators Ltd</p><p>- Draintech </p><p>- CSI Cleaning Services</p><p>- SDS Traffic Management Services</p><p>- Bill Kearney </p><p>- BirdWatch Ireland.</p></reply>

This was not confined to the Defence Forces, but was a public service-wide phenomenon. </p>  <p>  The Commission on Public Service Pensions Pension in its Final Report (2000) examined a range of submissions that sought a new option to join the schemes but recommended against opening a further general membership option across the public service as a whole. The Commission was concerned about the major additional costs which a new option would impose, given that it would almost certainly be availed of by those who would either have an immediate entitlement or a high expectation of benefit at a later stage. A further option, the Commission argued, would weaken the integrity of the schemes, would lead to pressure for individuals to be permitted to enter and leave at will, and could undermine fundamentally the financing of the schemes, which operate on the insurance principle, i.e. that not everyone benefits.</p>  <p>  However, the Pension Commission accepted that in a number of cases, perceptions of injustice might have arisen as a result of the exercise of past options not to join S&amp;C schemes. For that reason, it recommended that a limited appeals process for scheme membership options be established to examine individual cases and to allow appeals that met any one of the following criteria:</p>  <p>  &lsquo;(i) where there is no evidence that an option was provided to the individual public servant in the first place;</p>  <p>  (ii) where there is medical evidence to indicate that the person making the decision not to join the scheme was of sufficiently unsound mind not to appreciate the consequences of his or her decision;</p>  <p>  (iii) where a member of the original scheme declined to join the revised scheme in circumstances where there would have been no reasonably foreseeable adverse financial consequences for the individual (in terms only of his or her scheme contributions) had he or she instead opted to join the revised scheme.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  A comprehensive framework for addressing outstanding Pension Commission recommendations was agreed by a joint management-union Working Group and subsequently approved by the Government in 2004. Since then, the criteria recommended by the Pension Commission have been used in considering S&amp;C scheme membership option appeals.</p>  <p>  My information is that five appeal cases have been submitted to my Department under the Pension Commission limited appeals mechanism by the Department of Defence on behalf of spouses (or children) of deceased members of the Defence Forces, and that all five have been allowed, subject to complying with all of the requirements regarding qualification and payment of a spouse&rsquo;s pension and children&rsquo;s pensions under the relevant scheme rules, including the payment of any relevant outstanding member contributions. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the operation of the S&amp;C scheme membership option appeals mechanism. I consider that it is consistent with the Pension Commission&rsquo;s analysis and recommendations on the issues involved (as I have outlined them above), and that both of these remain valid today.</p></reply>

This is a national scheme of humanitarian assistance, targeting aid at those worst affected properties, for which there are no alternative feasible measures. </p><p>The Government decision confirmed that a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions to be eligible for assistance under this scheme, including:</p><p>- That floodwater entered and damaged the building during the relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable. </p><p>- That the property was the homeowner&rsquo;s primary residence at the time of the floods. </p><p>- That the affected property must have a significant probability of the recurrence of the flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could cause further serious and similar damage to the home. </p><p>- That the property is not due to or may not benefit from a planned or possible future major, minor or individual flood defence scheme. </p><p>- That the property may not be protected adequately from being flooded in the future, at an economically feasible cost, through other flood mitigation works including minor works, individual property protection or other possible measures that can be considered at this time. </p><p>- That the homeowner is unable to obtain flood risk insurance.</p><p>At this time, in relation to those homeowners being considered under the scheme, the OPW is continuing to work with each of the Local Authorities.  To date: </p><p>- 43 homeowners have been met in relation to the scheme and in June of this year,<b></b>36 of these homeowners were invited to apply for the next stage that includes a site inspection,</p><p>- 43 homes have been approved or are being considered by the Local Authorities for remedial works, to provide an engineering solution to their property,</p><p>- 58 homes did not meet the criteria for the scheme.</p><p>The numbers of homes within the process are changing regularly as homeowners make contact with the OPW and as assessments are completed. </p><p>The OPW has budgeted up to &euro;3m this year for the potential costs associated with this scheme. </p><p><b>Shannon Group &amp;amp; Lake Levels </b></p><p>The Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group met on six occasions in 2016.  During 2016, the primary focus of the Group was to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies and set out a Work Programme. In 2017, a number of sub-committees were established in accordance with the Group's Terms of Reference to progress the delivery of initiatives agreed by the Group.  The Group met formally twice in 2017 with sub-committee and other bilateral meetings taking place more frequently as required. The Group has met once this year with another meeting scheduled for October.</p><p>Information about the Group is available on the OPW website, <i>www.opw.ie.</i></p><p>The Group took a decision in October 2016 to trial the lowering of the lake levels on Lough Allen, within the existing statutory framework, during the Winter 2016/2017 to help mitigate potential flood risk. A protocol was finalised between ESB, Waterways Ireland and the OPW to lower the late Autumn and Winter minimum lake levels in Lough Allen by approximately 0.7 metres with the first reduction implemented in October 2016.  The trial was repeated for the Winter 2017/2018 and is being reviewed.  The Group took a decision at its meeting in May to repeat the trial for this coming Winter, subject to the review.</p><p>The Group at its meeting on 2 December, 2016 took a major decision to develop a plan for a strategic maintenance programme on the River Shannon to halt the deterioration of the river channel.  Planning for a strategic maintenance programme has been advanced during 2017 and 2018 and will be discussed by the Group at its meeting in October. </p><p><b>Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group </b></p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group, that I chair, met twice in 2015, four times in 2016, once in 2017, once in 2018 to date with a further meeting scheduled for October.  The most recent meeting was held on 7th February, 2018. </p><p>In November 2016, Government agreed an interim report from the Interdepartmental Flood Policy Coordination Group setting out progress on its work and making appropriate recommendations for consideration by Government.  This report is available to view on the OPW website at <i>.</i></p><p><i></i>Implementing the National Flood Risk Policy, launched with the Flood Risk Management Plans on 3 May 2018, provides an update of progress by the Group&rsquo;s implementation of the national flood risk policy.  This report is available on <i>www.floodinfo.ie</i></p><p><b>National Flood Forecasting &amp;amp; Warning Service</b></p><p>A Steering Group has been established to steer, support and oversee the establishment of a new National Flood Forecasting Service.  The Steering Group has met on sixteen occasions to date, agreed a Terms of Reference and prepared and agreed an implementation plan comprising a number of phases, including an initial set-up phase and a development and trial phase.  Work is now progressing on these phases. </p><p>The service will deal with flood forecasting from fluvial (river) and coastal sources.  When established it will involve the issuing of flood forecasts and general alerts.</p><p>Given the complexities involved in establishing, designing, developing and testing this new service, it is anticipated that it will take at least 5 years before it is fully operational and it is estimated it will require a staffing complement of 15 full time posts.  To date, the following progress has been made including staff appointed:</p><p>- Met &Eacute;ireann has appointed two staff members to date to the project.</p><p>- Met &Eacute;ireann is in the process of recruiting Hydrometeorologists for its Flood Forecasting Centre.</p><p>- In April 2018, a contract was placed for a study of suitable catchment-based models and an assessment of integrator systems to be undertaken over an 18 month period.</p><p>- A Communications Working Group, reporting to the Steering Group, has been established to consider the communications needs of the service and has recently held its first meeting.  </p><p><b>Individual Property Protection </b></p><p>The Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group this year is considering the potential costs and benefits associated with the introduction of an individual property protection scheme. </p><p>The Group is being informed by two different OPW funded pilot projects, in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny and Crossmolina in County Mayo.  The Co-ordination Group&rsquo;s work, when completed, will be submitted to Government for consideration in the context of the merits of the introduction by Government of any scheme to support individual property protection measures.</p><p>Following consideration of the consultant engineer&rsquo;s feasibility report on a potential IPP scheme, Kilkenny County Council, having noted the limitations of such measures and having regard to the adoption by the Council in June 2018 of the Flood Risk Management Plan for the Kilkenny area which includes proposals for permanent flood defence schemes for both Graiguenamanagh and Thomastown, has confirmed to the OPW that it does not now propose to progress the implementation of IPP measures for the two towns. The Council&rsquo;s preference is for permanent flood defence measures and it is now in correspondence and discussion with the OPW on the implementation of the proposed schemes for the two towns and other proposed flood defence schemes for County Kilkenny.  Expenditure to date on the Kilkenny pilot scheme is &euro;27,956 which relates to costs incurred for the commission of the feasibility report for the pilot.</p><p>Mayo County Council (MCC), in conjunction with the Office of Public Works (OPW) and the local Flood Action Group, have progressed a pilot project for the installation of flood gates for properties in Crossmolina.  A survey of households in the town by MCC received expressions of interest from over 70 homeowners. OPW appointed consultants to undertake a survey of individual properties to determine their suitability for floodgates, and to make recommendations for each property.  MCC procured a contractor to supply and install the floodgates based on the recommendations of the consultants.  The OPW has provided some &euro;237,000 in funding to date for this pilot with gates having now been installed in 67 properties in the town.  Some property owners who originally expressed an interest in having gates installed have not responded to further communications from the consultant appointed by OPW.  As a result, these properties are still awaiting gates. </p><p>Additionally, a review is ongoing as to whether further properties in Crossmolina might benefit from the installation of gates.</p><p><b>Riparian Guidance</b></p><p>The OPW will be publishing on <i>www.flooding.ie</i>guidance to landowners in relation to the maintenance of watercourses on or near their lands in the context of managing flood risk.  This website is undergoing a review and it is expected that an updated website with some guidance will be available before the end of this year. </p></reply>

The Teaching Council's (Registration) Regulations 2016 set out the routes under which teachers are eligible to apply for registration.  A degree in Early Childhood Teaching and Learning, while valuable, is not an accredited course nor does it meet the registration requirements under Route 4 Other of the Teaching Council Registration Regulations 2016 (formerly Regulation 3 Montessori and Other Categories of the 2009 Regulations).</p>  <p>  Under the Council&rsquo;s criteria for initial teacher education (revised in March 2017), student teachers in all accredited programmes are required to undertake study in Inclusive Education (Special Education, Multiculturalism, Disadvantage, etc.) as mandatory areas.</p>  <p>  Registration under Route 3 (Further Education) of the 2016 Regulations is the only route to registration available where an accredited qualification is not held.  Applicants who apply under this route must hold a degree qualification but are not initially required to hold a teacher education qualification (TEQ).  A relevant TEQ is required under Route 3.  However applicants who meet the degree qualification requirements and who have not completed an accredited TEQ are eligible for conditional registration for a period of three years in which time this requirement must be completed.</p>  <p>  The St. Nicholas Montessori College degree in Montessori Education has long standing recognition with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and was subsequently amalgamated into the Council&rsquo;s Registration Regulations.  This is being phased out.

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools.  Though schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in primary and secondary schools, where staff employed on these schemes are paid directly by the Department and not via grant funding, these schemes have been largely phased out and have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant scheme.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance.</p><p>In terms of the latest negotiations that have taken place with regard to school secretaries, in 2015 my Department engaged with the Union side on negotiations in relation to the pay of school secretaries (and caretakers) who are employed using grant funding, and agreed to enter an arbitration process on that issue.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries (and caretakers).</p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at:</p><p>Circular 0078/2017: <i>.</i></p><p>Circular 0079/2017: <i>.</i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator's recommendation applies. </p><p>With regard to bus drivers, and as the Deputy is aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of the Department, and issues regarding the terms and conditions and employment status of bus drivers under that scheme is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment of 167 on 30th September 2017.  This provides for a mainstream staffing of Principal and 5 classroom teachers for the 2018/19 school year.  The school will also have 1 full-time and 1 shared Special Education Teachers.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. </p>  <p>  The school submitted an application for consideration by the Appeals Board at its May 2018 meeting under the Exceptional Accommodation Difficulties criteria.  The appeal was refused by the Appeals Board on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not warrant the allocation of an additional post under Circular 0010/2018.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.  My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.  Given that the staffing schedule operates to a general average of one classroom teacher for every 26 pupils, if a school has a large class it generally also has a small class.</p></reply>

My Department is strongly supportive of the promotion of positive mental health awareness in post-primary schools.  The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems including behavioural, emotional and social. </p>  <p>  To support this holistic approach my Department has published a Wellbeing Policy and Framework for Practice (2018-2023) for all schools which will inform how schools can promote student wellbeing.  It is the Department&rsquo;s aim that by 2023 all schools and centres for education will have embedded a dynamic Wellbeing Promotion Process which promotes a whole school preventative approach to the promotion of wellbeing with interventions at both universal and targeted levels.  This approach is the most beneficial evidence informed approach for schools in the promotion of mental health and the support for students with mental health difficulties.  The Wellbeing Policy includes an Implementation Plan with seven high level actions to support the realisation of the policy.  Actions 2, 3 and 4 below focus on the need for the training of teachers which will include work with schools to ensure those students with most needs, including mental health needs, receive the highest level of support. </p>  <p>  - Plan and provide for the national roll-out of a professional development process to facilitate all schools and centres for education to engage with and embed a Wellbeing Promotion Process which builds professional capacity and collaborative cultures in schools from 2018-2023.</p>  <p>  - Provide for an aligned, comprehensive and easily-accessible programme of support for all schools and centres for education to address school-identified Wellbeing Promotion Needs.</p>  <p>  - Consider how the system is meeting current and future teachers&rsquo; learning needs relating to wellbeing promotion.  </p>  <p>  The Wellbeing Policy also builds on the work already taking place in schools including the new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) which places a clear emphasis on overall student health and wellbeing.  This Framework is underpinned by eight principles, one of which is "Wellbeing" covering the development of key skills of &ldquo;Managing Myself" and "Staying Well" which cover issues such as mental health and mental ill-health, dealing with tough times, loss and bereavement.  A Junior Cycle Wellbeing programme was introduced to post primary schools in 2017 as part of the Framework for Junior Cycle which includes the implementation of curricular areas of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Physical Education.  Support for implementation of the national Wellbeing in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) is also encompassed within the Wellbeing Policy and Framework for Practice implementation.  </p>  <p>  Responsibility for provision of mental health services and counselling for young people lies with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  Schools are advised to identify supports and services that are available in their community, build relationships and agree referral pathways for students needing referral.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides psychological support and engages in collaborative work helping school staff including the school&rsquo;s Guidance Counselling Service in how to access appropriate mental health services.  Psychologists support schools in connecting with Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health services in relation to individual children and young people with mental health needs.  Psychologists support and encourage the establishment of referral and communication protocols between education and health services at local level and work with others to develop community based mental health promotion strategies.  In addition NEPS psychologists provide support to schools in implementing Student Support Teams in Post Primary Schools (2014).  A project is planned for supporting three clusters of schools in Donegal, Dublin and Cork in developing or reviewing student support teams in post primary schools in September 2018.  </p>  <p>   NEPS also provides guidelines and resource materials for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect students and school staff.  The guidelines responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools (2016) refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment.  It also outlines how schools can plan for crises.  The publication provides support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time with practical step-by-step guidance for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs.  The guidelines focus on alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community.  In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches.  NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at the schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff and students.</p>  <p>  A Wellbeing Steering Committee is overseeing the implementation plan in the Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice within my Department.  It examines issues in relation to the co-ordination and aligning of the range of supports provided to schools in regard to wellbeing and mental health promotion.  This involves coordinating the liaison with other Departments and Government agencies. </p>  <p>  Significant resources and developments to achieve these actions have been committed to across a number of sections of the Department.  NEPS capacity to enhance educational psychological service to schools has been increased through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists in the last academic year and a further 10 psychologists in 2018/19.  The focus of part of this additional support, in the context of post-primary schools, is on extending the delivery of training in the Friends programmes to teachers in DEIS schools.  This programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in young people thus promoting mental health. </p>  <p>Enhancing Guidance Counselling Provision at post-primary level has been achieved through improvements in the guidance allocation to schools, with Budgets 2016 and 2017 together seeing the allocation of the equivalent of 500 guidance posts, following budget measures in 2012 which removed the ex-quota provision for guidance posts (which amounted to some 600 posts).  The 500 guidance posts which have now been restored will be allocated separately and transparently.  This means that there is now an obligation on principals to ensure that these hours are used for guidance activities.  Principals may decide to allocate more hours to guidance activities than the amount allocated on the schedule; they cannot decide to allocate fewer. </p>  <p>  Circular Letter 0010/2017 &lsquo;Approved Allocation of Teaching Posts 2017/18 School Year&rsquo; provides a separate guidance allocation to schools by reducing the Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR). The CL states that &ldquo;Guidance plans should outline the school&rsquo;s approach to guidance generally and how students can be supported and assisted in making choices and successful transitions in the personal and social, educational and career areas.&rdquo;  Schools are asked to consider &ldquo;how best to align resource allocation with the objectives of the Guidance Plan&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Department also works with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the Health Promoting Schools initiative, which is supported by the Health Service Executive.  This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing on whole-school level conditions that affect health and wellbeing of children and young people. </p>  <p>  Finding new ways of tackling policy issues that are not the sole responsibility of any one Government Department or agency has been prioritised by Government.  My Department has been involved with the Taskforce on Youth Mental Health as part of the programme for Government.  One of the challenges of providing a coordinated, streamlined approach to mental health promotion is the fact that there are so many statutory and voluntary agencies/services/NGOs involved.  The Task Force was established to produce a series of action-focused recommendations to improve youth mental health.  The main areas of focus comprised: emotional literacy and reduction of stigma; awareness of services and supports; accessibility to services and supports across different settings; alignment of services and supports across different providers; and building capacity in local communities.  The report has been published and a memorandum has been agreed the Government.   </p>  <p>  The work of implementing the Taskforce recommendations will be linked with the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project.  Youth mental health and suicide prevention is one of three Pathfinder Projects under Action 5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan (2014) and agreed by the Civil Service Management Board.  This Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project is an initiative to innovate and improve whole-of-Government working on cross-cutting policy issues and improve the delivery of shared whole-of-Government projects.  The aim is to strengthen management and accountability of cross-cutting projects that involve multiple Departments, Offices and Agencies and ensure that policies that are not the priority or responsibility of a single body are effectively managed, supported and resourced.</p></reply>

A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons, including those offering Irish-medium Gaelscoileanna.  Parental preferences for patronage and language of instruction, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) opened in June 2018 for the four post-primary schools to be established in 2019 and my Department is currently preparing assessment reports for the NSEG. The Patronage Process for the primary schools to be established in 2019 will commence later this year.</p>  <p>  Separately, I have announced the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process to help accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools towards the Government target of reaching 400 such schools by 2030. The new plans are designed to provide multi- and non-denominational schools by way of patronage transfer of existing schools.  An opportunity will be available to English-medium schools seeking to make a transition to Gaelscoil provision in that context, in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community.</p></reply>

The redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget.  Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers.</p>  <p>  After the redeployment and supplementary panel processes have transacted, each school is permitted to fill any remaining vacancies through open recruitment. It is open to any suitably qualified teacher to apply for these advertised teaching positions as they arise.</p>  <p>  The redeployment arrangements are reviewed and agreed annually with the Education Partners (i.e. School management bodies, Teacher Unions etc). Arrangements for the next school year will be finalised later in the Autumn and the relevant circulars will be available on my Department's website at that stage. </p></reply>

The procedures require schools to prepare, display and publish a Child Safeguarding Statement in accordance with the requirements of the Children First Act 2015. As part of the Child Safeguarding Statement schools are required to undertake a risk assessment to help identify the child protection and welfare considerations applicable to school activities, policies, procedures and practices. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s procedures for schools also outline that under the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 it is a criminal offence to withhold information about certain serious offences, against a person under 18 years or a vulnerable person.</p><p>The reporting obligations under the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 are in addition to the reporting obligations under Children First National Guidance 2017 and the Children First Act, 2015.</p></reply>

To date actions under the National Student Accommodation Strategy has delivered a fast-track planning procedure for strategic housing developments, which includes student accommodation projects containing 200 or more bed spaces, under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  The Act also provides for Higher Education Institutes to borrow money from the Housing Finance Agency for the purposes of financing student accommodation provision.  </p><p>The target in the Strategy was to facilitate the construction of 7,000 PBSA bed spaces by the end of 2019 and 21,000 by 2024.  We are on track to meet, and likely exceed, these targets.  Figures at the end of July indicate that over 4,000 bed spaces have been delivered in the past two years with a further 1,160 due for completion this month.  </p><p>Moreover, the Government is committed to taking steps to improve the position of rent predictability for students, and the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are working to develop proposals in this regard.  </p><p>In the immediate term, the Government are supporting the USI #HomesforStudy campaign which aims to increase the numbers of rooms available in digs accommodation.  This offers students an alternative to purpose built student accommodation.

The NDP also highlights the importance of examining the role of Building Information Modelling and adopting other technologies and innovative practices in driving improving productivity and efficiencies.  The work of the Group will, therefore have an important role to play in ensuring that the construction sector enhances its capacity to meet infrastructural priorities over the next decade. </p>  <p>  In responding to specific skill needs for the construction sector, a particular focus of my Department and the education and training sector more generally has been an expansion in apprenticeship recruitment.</p>  <p>  Apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme, which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market.  Consequently, the number of construction related apprentices being registered is determined by employers within the construction sector. My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector.  Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.  </p>  <p>  Construction related apprenticeship registrations increased from 1,713 in 2015 to 2,314 in 2016 which represents an increase of 35%.  This trend continued in 2017 with a further increase of 28% bringing the total number of construction related registrations to 2,963.  </p>  <p>  The range of apprenticeships on offer is also being expanded to meet the identified skill needs of the sector.  Arising from our first call for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 an apprenticeship in Engineering Services Management, with the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) as industry lead, is currently being developed into a national apprenticeship programme.  In addition, 26 further new programmes arising from last year&rsquo;s second call for proposals were approved for further development into national apprenticeships, including a scaffolding apprenticeship, again with the CIF as industry lead and a senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland as industry lead.  These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs identified by the sector.</p>  <p>  In addition to apprenticeship provision, almost 7,000 beneficiaries participated in SOLAS-funded construction related further education and training programmes provided by Education and Training Boards (ETBs) during 2017.  Separately, following a series of discussions with the Construction Industry Federation, programmes have been put in place to produce approximately 100 form workers, 100 steel-fixers and 50 curtain wallers per year.  SOLAS will continue to engage with the ETBs to expand provision to meet needs in these areas.</p></reply>

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with a child for individual intensive intervention or assessment.  </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.  </p>  <p>  Where, by agreement with the school authorities, the child is referred to the NEPS psychologist it is with the full consent of the child&rsquo;s parents or guardians and commences a formal documented process which is maintained on the NEPS Casetrack database.  </p>  <p>  This referral process involves a range of information gathering on the child, providing relevant background to the child&rsquo;s educational and social development and to the particular concerns raised which warrant consideration.  Depending on the nature and context of the concerns raised the psychologist may involve themselves directly with the child in, for example, applying a range of psychometric tests or observation of the child in the school setting and / or engage in consultation with parents, teachers and other involved professionals.  The overall focus of any or all of these interactions is to enable the psychologist to identify the needs of the child  and to make recommendations as to the appropriate intervention(s) to address these needs.  </p>  <p>  All of the above interventions are considered to be in the context of an assessment process, some involving direct contact with the child, others not.  They are all used in part or combination to inform the process.  While engagement with parents and school authorities is implicit in each referral, in a minority of cases, direct contact may not be necessary between the psychologist and child.  </p>  <p>  In this context and relating to the Deputy's specific question I have made enquiries into the matter and can inform her that in 2012/13 some 6,856 referrals with NEPS involved direct contact with the child concerned, in 2013/14 &ndash; 6,418 and in 2014/15 &ndash; 6,311.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government has provided &euro;49.5 million for the scheme in 2018 which is means tested scheme.   </p>  <p>  In addition, in an attempt to reduce back to school costs for those living in direct provision accommodation centres, return to school packs have been provided in respect of some 1,100 school going children under the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) EU Programme which is managed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The pack comprises of basic stationery items relevant to their educational level requirements.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education, which aims to make the Irish education and training service the best in Europe, commits to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.  In 2017 as Minister for Education and Skills, I, introduced measures that now requires school authorities to adopt principles of cost-effective practice which will put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and increase the financial support for book rental schemes, in order to reduce/eliminate school book costs for parents.</p>  <p>  Funding is provided by my Department for the provision of a book grant to all recognised primary and post primary schools within the Free Education Scheme, with DEIS schools receiving an enhanced rate.  The Department provided approximately &euro;16.5m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2017.  </p>  <p>  Primary and Post Primary schools received funding of &euro;15.7m over three years 2014 &ndash; 2016 in support of the establishment of book rental schemes.  DEIS schools received &euro;150 per child and non-DEIS schools received &euro;100 per child in seed capital to establish book rental schemes.  The most recent figures available indicate that 65% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme and at post primary level 68% of schools reported operating a book rental scheme.   </p>  <p>  At present as Minister for Education and Skills, I am introducing a requirement on every school to consult with parents and students regularly, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter.  Some of the issues which schools will be required to deal with under the charter include: </p>  <p>  - Consult students and parents regularly in relation to school costs and work to avoid costs acting as a barrier</p>  <p>  - Publish a school financial statement which would include information on how any voluntary contributions are used </p>  <p>  - Schools are encouraged to develop uniform policies in consultation with parents.   </p>  <p>  The Bill to provide for a Parent and Student Charter is in the process of being drafted in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.  It will be published in the coming months.   </p></reply>

The group is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and it last met on 29 June. </p>  <p>  The steering group is considering the issues that impact on teacher supply, including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession. The steering group will oversee a programme of actions according to strict timelines and clear deliverables.  In undertaking its task, the group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  In the last two years we have hired 5,000 additional new teachers. It is the case that many teachers who would have been available to carry out substitute work are now gaining permanent and long term contracts and I am aware that some schools experienced difficulties in finding substitute teachers in 2017. </p>  <p>  In order to ease the situation, in the last school year I suspended the limits that teachers on career break can work as substitutes. Schools were also reminded that, in considering career break applications, the needs of pupils should take precedence and they must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers.</p>  <p>  The steering group is due to meet again on 10 September. At this point the steering group and the working groups reporting to it have met on a number of occasions and I hope to be in a position to announce further measures to support teacher supply over the coming months.  </p></reply>

The distribution of the population necessitates a relatively large number of small primary schools. In the case of principals in smaller schools, while management and administrations duties may be smaller in scale than those of larger schools, they must be undertaken in addition to their full-time teaching duties.</p><p>The enrolment required for administrative principal in ordinary schools, gaelscoileanna and schools in the Gaeltacht is 176 pupils, or 113 if operating a specialist autism unit. </p><p>Schools that have less than this enrolment have teaching principals. Recently published Circular 40/2018 is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, which outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties. Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p><p>Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4,600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p><p>While the principal is ultimately responsible to the board of management for the management and leadership of the school, the deputy principal occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school. The deputy principal co-operates with the principal in the fulfilment of the principal's role and acts or deputises as the principal in the principal's absence.</p><p>I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018/19 school year.

However, I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year. In the last two budgets, I made provision for 6,000 extra teachers and 3,000 extra SNAs and over 3,000 new middle management posts.  These resources were allocated to improve the learning experience right across the sector, with a particular focus on children with special needs.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2018 marked the second year of major reinvestment in the education sector, as we continue to implement the Action Plan for Education, which has the central aim to make the Irish education and training service the best in Europe within a decade.  In 2018, the budget for the Department of Education increased by &euro;554 million to over &euro;10 billion. Through budget 2017 and Budget 2018, we are now investing &euro;1 billion more in education.</p>  <p>  Voluntary contributions to schools by parents are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to them that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition and that a child's place in the school or continued enrolment is not dependant on a willingness to make a contribution. </p>  <p>  The manner in which voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character. As voluntary contributions are used by schools for many different purposes it is not my intention to seek to abolish them. </p>  <p>   The parent and charter bill will provide for parents to be provided better information including in relation to school accounts and the use of voluntary contributions.</p></reply>

This requires a teacher to submit an application for registration, provide supporting documentation and complete the vetting process.  Where an applicant holds an out-of-State qualification the documentation is assessed under the EU Directive 2005/36/EC as amended.  Finalising registration only occurs once the application is fully processed including the qualifications assessment process. </p>  <p>  Generally teachers are initially registered with the condition of fulfilling post-qualification professional practice conditions.  The teacher is given three years from the date of registration to fulfil these conditions.  For teachers who have these conditions attached, it is not possible to commence the fulfilment of these conditions until initial registration is finalised.  Should a teacher have previously fulfilled these conditions or an equivalent in a different jurisdiction then the condition can be lifted on submission of the relevant evidence.</p>  <p>  Where a teacher has a specific query regarding his/her conditions of registration, queries should be sent to conditions@teachingcouncil.ie. </p></reply>

Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.</p>  <p>  Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the long-standing moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels. This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total).</p>  <p>  Circular 63/2017 was issued by my Department in September 2017 which sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools.  Flexibility in identifying and prioritising the evolving leadership and management needs of the school, and in assigning and re-assigning post holders to specific roles and responsibilities to meet the evolving needs of a school, is an essential feature of this school leadership model.</p>  <p>  While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal also occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school. The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school. These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p>  <p>  The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts have been filled, including in schools where the Principal is a "Teaching Principal".</p>  <p>  I also recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts are available to be put in place for the 2018/19 school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p></reply>

Circular 10/2018 outlines the allocation process for the 2018/19 school year for primary schools. The published criteria also includes the primary staffing schedule, which operates on the basis of enrolment bands and does so in a clear and transparent manner. </p><p>For the 2018/19 school year, the staffing schedule at Primary level will operate on a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher (26:1). This is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.  </p><p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts as permitted by the staffing schedule is a matter for the individual Board of Managements of each school.</p><p>The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data relating to pupil enrolment and individual class groupings for all schools at primary level.  The most recent published information relates to the 2017/2018 school year.</p><p>The information sought by the Deputy is being compiled by the Teacher Allocation section of my Department and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</p><p>.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country.  </p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. The Patronage Process for the primary schools to be established in 2019, including the new primary school referred to by the Deputy, will commence later this year. </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  An initial phased start-up is envisaged for the new schools, which typically involves the use of interim accommodation. However, this is the first time the requirement for new schools is set out over a 4-year horizon and this will provide a better lead-in period for the planning and delivery of permanent accommodation solutions.  </p>  <p>  In line with the policy on the use of state assets (Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars 11/15 and 17/16), my Department will be seeking to maximise the use of sites already in my ownership and of available properties in the ownership of other State bodies, where these are considered suitable.</p>  <p>  In addition as part of my Department's ongoing engagement with Local Authorities in respect of statutory planning processes and under the MoU on school site acquisitions, my Department will be examining all potential suitable site options, including appropriately zoned sites, to serve the relevant areas. </p>  <p>  Taking into account all of the above, decisions will then be made as part of the site acquisition process in relation to appropriate sites for all the schools announced and will be confirmed at a later date.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that all children must be enrolled in the primary school system, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools in the September prior to their sixth birthday.</p><p>The greater proportion of children with special education needs attend mainstream class, where they may access additional supports if required. </p><p>Some students with special education needs, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there and placement in a special class is an option for them. </p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week. </p><p>The Department therefore provides for a continuum of provision which includes mainstream school placements with additional supports, or for pupils who require more specialist interventions, special class and special school placements.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers, for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.</p><p>The NCSE and my Department work closely together to address issues in specialised provision that arise from time in time at local levels and also to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.</p><p>To this end my Department and the NCSE have convened a working group to put in place a new working protocol to ensure that there is effective pro-active planning and timely delivery of specialist educational places for students in special classes and special schools.</p><p>The focus of the working group is to guide the development of necessary placements in schools in the short, medium and longer terms to meet the anticipated needs of pupils and to ensure that any necessary school building or refurbishment and school transport considerations are resolved as early as possible so that placement options can be accessed where and when they are needed. </p><p>My Department has acknowledged that in recent years the establishment of special provision in some schools and communities has been challenging. </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was signed by the President on 18 July 2018 and will, when commenced, assist parents to more easily access local schools and to enrol their children in a school that meets their needs. </p><p>When commenced, the Act will also, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, provide a power for the Minister to direct a school to make additional provision in respect of children with special educational needs. </p><p>The direction by me will be preceded by a number of steps to allow for engagement between myself, the NCSE, the Board of Management and Patron and where the owner is not the Patron, the owner of a school.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need. </p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 130% from 548 in 2011 to 1,456 across the country now. In addition there are currently 124 Special schools of which provide 7,872 placements for children with very complex needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to establish further specialised placements during the school year where such need has been identified.</p><p>In circumstances, where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department can provide Home Tuition grant funding towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available. </p><p>Applications can be made at any point of the school year, based on when the child receives a diagnosis and recommendation for a specialised placement.  </p><p>Over the course of the 2017/18 school year, 61 children with special education needs over the age of 6 availed of this interim provision.  Statistics for the current school year are not readily available. While the scheme has commenced, Statistics have yet to emerge as the Department has only begun to receive applications under the 2018/19 scheme.</p><p>Parents/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement, including special class placement, should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available at <i>.</i></p><p>The NCSE also works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school.  The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at<i>.</i></p></reply>

If a particular school has a query in relation to the cost of insurance it should raise this directly with its insurance provider.</p>  <p>  Boards of Management and ETBs should take a proactive approach when it comes to sourcing insurance in order to ensure best value is obtained and to ensure compliance with public procurement procedures.  The Schools Procurement Unit which has a national remit is available to advise and assist schools in relation to procurement matters.  </p>  <p>  It is my view that it is important for children to avail of the opportunity to exercise at school and that children should be able to run and move freely in the school yard unless there are very compelling reasons for individual schools to prohibit such activity.</p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 sets out the responsibilities on individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools.  It is also a matter for school authorities to determine school policies, taking into account any health and safety risks to children running in the school yard and to put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate any potential risk to the school community. </p>  <p>  As part of the management of the risks there is an onus on Boards of Management and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) in respect of schools operated by them to ensure, as appropriate, that they have put in place comprehensive insurance cover for schools.  Boards are advised by my Department to ensure that all such insurances are effected and maintained as are necessary to safeguard the school, the Board and the Trustees against all public liability. Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998 the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.  </p>  <p>  Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and responsibility for the appropriate supervision of students is therefore a matter for the individual Board of Management.  While appreciating that it is not always possible to eliminate all risks, it should nevertheless be possible to manage them in such a manner that pupils can run in school yards provided it is done in an orderly and supervised manner.</p></reply>

Where the introduction of new technology is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised.  The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made.  </p><p>An advice sheet on the adoption of tablets in schools is available on the PDST-Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) website, detailing what tablets can offer a school, educational considerations, purchasing considerations and software.</p><p>It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of textbooks in the school. Individual schools should adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.</p><p>The vital contribution of the library service to literacy and numeracy and education more broadly is reflected in the National Strategy for Literacy and Numeracy 2011-2020.  The strategy, which was reviewed in 2017, includes as an action the promotion of library usage as a means of supporting family literacy, and ensuring that all children, through their school and parents, are motivated to avail of membership of a public library.</p><p>In relation to textbook costs an agreement was reached with the Irish Educational Publisher&rsquo;s Association which resulted in the agreement of a Code of Practice.  The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock book rental schemes.</p><p>School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents. Circa. 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  </p><p>My Department supports the operation of book rental schemes through the funding provided under its school books grant scheme.  Under this scheme, my Department provides funding of &euro;16.7 million annually to all recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme.

Vetting is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.</p>  <p>  Vetting checks are conducted by the Vetting Bureau for each new application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that in general the vetting process is working well. At present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The e-vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-vetting system to do so. In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated.</p>  <p>  That said, the Deputy will wish to be aware that the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 provides at section 12 for certain circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant and by the organisations in question.</p></reply>

It also requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process. </p>  <p>  The Equality Division in the Department of Justice and Equality has been designated as the focal point. Equality Division has policy responsibility for disability and equality, and domestic human and fundamental rights.

The IHREC Act 2014 was designed to ensure that IHREC, as Ireland&rsquo;s National Human Rights Institution, fully meets the standard of independence in accordance with the Paris Principles, and is best placed to make periodic independent reports to the UN, supported by progress assessments and statistical information supplied by the NDA.  The NDA has expertise and information resources in relation to reporting on disability issues. </p>  <p>  Ongoing progress and implementation will be internally monitored through the structures in place to support the implementation of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS).  The NDIS was published on 14 July 2017 and its implementation is monitored by a Steering Group which comprises the key departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group.  The Strategy is an all-of-Government approach and focuses on eight key themes including equality and choice, the provision of services, accommodation, health, employment, transport and education.  </p></reply>

Ireland supports efforts made by the European Union and its Member States to put a stop to the unnecessary deaths in the Mediterranean. Ireland has been active in Search and Rescue missions in the Mediterranean since 2015, first through Operation Pontus, a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Italy running in parallel to Operation Sophia. Ireland has been a full member of Operation Sophia since 2017. Since 2015, Irish naval vessels have rescued thousands of migrants at sea.</p>  <p>  In its conclusions of 28 June, the European Council, following a meeting which was attended by the Taoiseach, reconfirmed that a functioning EU policy on migration relies on a comprehensive approach to migration which combines effective controls of the EU's external borders, increased external action as well as the internal aspects of migration.</p>  <p>  In order to break the business model of the smugglers and prevent loss of life at sea, the Council agreed that a new approach is required in relation to those who are saved in Search and Rescue operations. In this regard, the European Council called on the Council and the Commission to explore the concept of regional disembarkation platforms, in cooperation with third countries as well as UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).  Furthermore, the European Council agreed to set up 'controlled centres' in willing Member States to allow for rapid processing to distinguish between irregular migrants and those in need of international protection.   </p>  <p>  Discussions on these measures are underway and I and my officials are playing an active role in their development. The Council itself confirmed in its conclusions that any centres established must operate in full compliance with international law. In advance of the measures being agreed, Ireland has on three separate occasions over the summer and in an act of humanitarian assistance and collegiality with other Member States, made pledges to take migrants who were rescued in the Mediterranean Sea and to process their applications for international protection. </p>  <p>  In addition to supporting the rescue of migrants at sea, and our active engagement in the on-going discussions on regional disembarkation and &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; centres, Ireland supports other measures to address the root causes of irregular migration, such as through the EU&rsquo;s efforts to stabilise Libya and neighbouring countries in North and West Africa, both politically and economically. The recently established AU-EU-UN Taskforce on Libya has seen some early successes in its efforts to support migrants in Libya. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to support numerous humanitarian and developmental programmes in developing Partner Countries through Irish Aid. Ireland continues to support the EU&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Africa, increasing our pledge to fifteen million euro. This is the third highest per capita contribution by an EU Member State. The Trust Fund is of paramount importance in addressing the root causes of irregular migration in Africa, through its effort, amongst other things, to stabilise Libya and neighbouring countries and to improve the socioeconomic situation in Africa.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports the opening up of new legal migratory pathways to Europe for third country nationals, as part of efforts to reduce irregular migration and to reduce the numbers of migrants making dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean Sea. Ireland expects to be an active participant in current and future pledges in respect of refugees and other vulnerable persons in need of protection. In this regard, we have pledged to resettle 600 refugees each year in 2018 and 2019 under the EU-UNHCR pledging exercise for the two-year period.</p></reply>

This is additional to the investment of approximately &euro;100 million in development of 3 major new Divisional and Regional Headquarters recently completed and entered into operational use at Galway, Wexford and Kevin Street Dublin. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will further appreciate that it is the Commissioner who is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the efficient and effective use of these resources.  The programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW). Decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles are a matter for the Commissioner in the light of his identified operational demands and the availability of resources. </p>  <p>  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters. However I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources (including allocation of Garda vehicles) under continual review so as to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Cavan / Monaghan Division, I am informed by the Garda authorities that under the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021, a new Garda station will be constructed in Bailieborough, County Cavan. I am informed that the planning application for the development of the new Station was lodged in August 2018. Until planning, the required public procurement process and contract award are completed, it is not possible to give a definitive date for completion of the construction of the new station.</p>  <p>  In advance of that new development, essential remediation works at the existing station at Bailieborough were also completed in 2016. The works involved enhancements to the public office and safety improvements throughout the building.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order. The Commissioner's final report in that regard recommends that Bawnboy Garda Station in County Cavan be included in the pilot.  The OPW and Commissioner are engaging in relation to the works required in that regard. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the strength of the Garda fleet in the Cavan/Monaghan Division as at 31 July 2018 is 58 vehicles.  </p>  <p>  I understand that provision has been made to purchase an additional 25 vehicles for the Northern Region in 2018, of which 4 have been allocated to the Cavan/Monaghan Division as at 31 July 2018. The exact allocation of these vehicles will be determined by Assistant Commissioner for the Northern Region in accordance with operational policing priorities following delivery of these vehicles. </p>  <p>With regard to the Meath Division, provision is made under the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 for works at Navan Garda Station, namely the demolition of the existing cell block and the construction of a new cell block and overhead office accommodation. I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is actively engaged with the OPW to progress this project.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that the strength of the Garda fleet in the Meath Division as at 31 July 2018 is 55 vehicles. </p>  <p>  I understand that provision has been made to purchase an additional 23 vehicles for the Eastern Region in 2018, of which 2 have been allocated to the Meath Division as at 31 July 2018. The exact allocation of these vehicles will be determined by Assistant Commissioner for the Eastern Region in accordance with operational policing priorities following delivery of these vehicles.</p>  <p>  Separate to the above details specific to the Cavan / Monaghan and Meath Divisions, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeks to address minor maintenance issues, including refurbishment, as they arise, liaising closely with the OPW in that regard. The progression of any works is subject to funding available and the competing accommodation priorities within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Finally and apart from capital investment, I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda division. Furthermore when allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management. Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-07a.1193.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018090700024#WRW00400"><p>The starting point for consideration of these issues is the best interests of the child.  Equal shared parenting may not be in the best interests of the child in every family situation.</p>  <p>  There has been extensive reform of family law in recent years to place a greater emphasis on recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her parents.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is a child&ndash;centred Act which addresses the rights of children to legal security, to the care of their parents and important adults in their lives, and to equality before the law.  The reforms in family law provided for in that Act recognise the crucial role of parents and the need for a child to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents.</p>  <p>  Married parents of a child are automatically joint guardians and have joint custody of their children.  Where married parents separate or divorce, they can decide between themselves on custody arrangements for their children or apply to the courts to decide on the matter.  If the father is not married to the mother of the child, he will not automatically become a guardian of the child.  The issue of automatic guardianship was considered during the passage of the Children and Family Relationships Bill through the Oireachtas.  However, the automatic extension of guardianship to a father who is not involved and is not participating in his child&rsquo;s life would have consequences for the child and the child&rsquo;s mother, for example, if he does not consent to the issue of a passport or to the placement of a child for adoption.</p>  <p>  There are provisions in place to facilitate non-marital fathers who have an ongoing relationship with their children to become guardians of their children.  Section 2(4A) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as inserted by section 43(c) of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) now provides for joint guardianship by a man who was not married to the mother of the child and was cohabiting with the mother for not less than 12 consecutive months.  This 12 month period must include a period, occurring at any time after the birth of the child, of not less than 3 months during which both the mother and father have lived with the child.  In addition, a father who is not married to the child's mother and does not satisfy the cohabitation requirements may become a guardian if the parents jointly make a statutory declaration appointing him as a guardian.  It is also open to the father at any stage to make an application to court for guardianship of the child under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Article 42A.4 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings concerning the guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child in such proceedings.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  The courts shall have regard to all of these factors or circumstances that it regards as being relevant to the child concerned and his or her family and make its decision accordingly.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that either parent of a child, whether or not he or she is also a guardian of the child, may apply to court for a direction regarding the custody of a child or the right of access to the child.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act obliges the court in proceedings under section 11 to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with each of his or her parents on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in guardianship, custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.</p>  <p>  Section 12A of the 1964 Act (inserted by section 58 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015) provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child.  It is a matter for the courts when making orders under the 1964 Act in relation to matters such as the guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child to determine the best interests of the child and to consider whether or not any conditions should be attached to such orders.</p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 made provision to assist parents who need to return to court because the other parent has breached a court order in relation to custody of, or access to, a child.  Section 56 of the 2015 Act inserted a new section 18A into the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  This provides that where a parent or guardian of a child has been granted custody of or access to the child under the 1964 Act, but he or she has been unreasonably denied such custody or access by another guardian or parent, that person may apply to court for an enforcement order.</p>  <p>  Court orders in relation to guardianship, custody and access are of course a matter for the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.</p>  <p>  While there are no plans at present for further amendment of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the operation of the law in this area is kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p></reply>

In pursuance of this commitment, a new grant-aid scheme was launched by my Department in 2017 to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas.  It is intended that the scheme will run for 3 years with funding of some &euro;1 million being made available each year.</p>  <p>  Eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p>  <p>  The Department receives a regular flow of enquiries regarding the scheme from a broad spectrum of the public.  There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme.  5 applications have been approved to date.  19 applications are being considered.  The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.</p>  <p>  I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme.  If the Deputy is aware of community groups wishing to avail of the scheme, I would point out that full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address, communitycctv@justice.ie.</p></reply>

The role of an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently resettled and the accommodation of persons in EROCs for a period of time is considered to be good practice by the UNHCR as it allows for a period of acclimatisation, de-stressing and on-site processing.</p>  <p>  In the case of Monasterevin, County Kildare, the premises in question was contracted as an EROC until August 2018.  The premises had also been offered to the Department as part of an 'Expressions of Interest for the Provision of Accommodation Services to Persons in the Protection Process' which was advertised in the National Press in January of this year.  Given the continued high demand for accommodation services for persons seeking international protection, the Department has contracted the Hazel Hotel to provide accommodation and ancillary services to those persons for a 1 year period.</p>  <p>  All persons in the IRPP cohort who had been living in the Centre at the time of closure have been relocated to another EROC.</p></reply>

Following their arrival in Ireland, and during their initial period of reception, they are accommodated in an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC).  As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently settled around the country.  In the EROCs both cohorts receive broadly the same integration services with due account being taken of the fact that certain things may not be able to happen until individuals receive a decision on their application for a grant of international protection. IRPP staff hold regular clinics in the EROCs, often at weekly intervals, at which individuals and families may discuss their needs and requirements.  The client group also receive an orientation and language training programme while in the EROC.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of a recent public procurement competition, Mosney, Co. Meath and Clonea Strand, Co. Waterford will be awarded contracts for the provision of EROC services.  These contracts will be for an initial 2 year period.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Abbeyfield Hotel in Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon is contracted to the Department to provide an EROC until December 2019.</p></reply>

Some &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution and allocation of Garda resources.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that there is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to support investment in CCTV systems at key locations along the road network and in urban centres.  This commitment is being progressed in a number of ways, including in particular through the community CCTV grant-aid scheme administered by my Department.</p><p>The intention is to support local communities who wish to install CCTV systems in their localities, including access roads to their areas where necessary and appropriate.  Under the scheme, which is being administered by my Department, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000. Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>.</p><p>That scheme supplements the existing network of CCTV Systems in operation in the State including both existing Garda and Community based CCTV schemes. For example, there are some 35 Garda CCTV schemes in operation throughout the State comprising some 523 cameras.  There are also some 45 Community-based CCTV schemes in operation encompassing some 367 cameras to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have access, established under the previous grant-aid scheme funded by my Department between 2005 and 2013.</p><p>I would point out that Joint Policing Committees play an important role in the establishment of Community CCTV schemes - indeed their approval is one of the statutory requirements for establishment of any community CCTV scheme.  In this regard the Deputy may find it useful to engage with her local Joint Policing Committee. </p><p>In addition to the Community CCTV scheme and as the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda Safety Camera Contract, GoSafe will provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones.</p><p>Further, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology is fitted in a number of official Garda vehicles which are allocated around the country and used on a daily basis to assist in the prevention and detection of crime, particularly on our roads network.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016 &ndash; 2021 (&quot;MRP&quot;) has identified a number of areas for expansion of ANPR including: </p><p>- increasing the number of ANPR units deployed;</p><p>- the addition of more &lsquo;watch-lists&rsquo; in order to remove a greater number of dangerous drivers and defective vehicles from the roads;</p><p>- examining the introduction of fixed ANPR sites at strategic locations across the roads network, in addition to using portable ANPR units while patrolling;</p><p>- working with the National Roads Authority, Port Authorities, Local Authorities and private car park operators in order to access data from their ANPR systems, as well as CCTV systems operating on the motorway network.</p><p>The MRP also sets out key strategic objectives for road policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road policing plans over the next 5 years.  Under the Programme, the Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints.</p><p>Finally and more generally, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that Garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary to detect and investigate crimes, and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24/7 basis.  Some &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million under the Government's Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to utilise appropriate technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community.</p></reply>

The Programme includes over &euro;60 million of Exchequer funding as well as a major Public Private Partnership (PPP) project to deliver stations at Macroom, Clonmel and Sligo.  This is in addition to the provision of over &euro;100 million for delivery of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters in Wexford, Galway and Kevin Street, Dublin, each of which, I am pleased to confirm, have been completed and are now operational.</p>  <p>  Regarding the PPP to deliver stations at Macroom, Clonmel and Sligo, I am informed by the OPW and the Garda authorities that the OPW has acquired sites for the development of the new stations in Macroom and Sligo.  The site for the new Garda Station in Clonmel is already in State ownership and its transfer to the OPW from Tipperary County Council is currently being finalised.</p>  <p>  The development of PPP projects is progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA).  My Department has been in contact with the NDFA with a view to progressing the matter further. It is not possible to provide a timeframe for the completion of these projects at this point.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of the core safety camera service over 6 years is approximately &euro;73 million excluding VAT (Total cost of the safety camera contract over 7 years is estimated at &euro;100.4 million, including VAT).  This represents a reduction of approximately 14% when compared with the cost which would have arisen over that time based on the charges under the previous contract.</p><p>Under the current contract, GoSafe will provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones.  This equates to a minimum of 7,400 monitoring hours and 100 survey hours a month.  This represents an annual increase of 300 hours on the previous contract.  The current contract also contains provisions for up to 1,500 additional monitoring hours within any calendar month and the option to avail of fixed, temporary fixed and average speed safety camera systems.</p><p>The role of the Safety Camera Contract is critical in the context of road traffic enforcement, improving road safety by changing driver behaviour in order to reduce road traffic fatalities and serious injuries by reducing the incidence of drivers exceeding stipulated speed limits, in circumstances where speeding is known to be a significant factor behind serious collisions.  As such, the deployment of safety cameras is determined by road safety considerations as opposed to revenue maximisation.</p><p>The overall impact of the safety cameras can be seen in the impact on the fatal collisions in the designated safety camera zones, referred to as speed enforcement zones.  The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones.  In 2015, this figure had reduced to 16% (or 24 road deaths) in safety camera zones.</p><p>The safety camera network has made a critical contribution to road traffic enforcement and, by extension, road safety, since its inception, and will continue to provide valuable support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of roads policing.</p><p>In relation to the statistics sought by the Deputy on receipts generated as a result of the safety camera contract for each of the past six years, the Deputy will recall that statistics for each year from 2010 to the end of May 2016 were provided in response to his Parliamentary Question No. 59 of 16 September 2016.  To be of assistance, the statistics relating to the years referred to in the Deputy's current question are reproduced below.<table><tr><th>2012 - &euro;</th><th>2013 - &euro;</th><th>2014 - &euro;</th><th>2015 - &euro;</th><th>2016 to end May - &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>4,613,360</td><td>4,383,880</td><td>6,584,880</td><td>7,521,400</td><td>2,144,720</td></tr></table></p><p>I have requested a report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to receipts generated as a result of the safety camera contract for the years 2016 and 2017 and I will be in contact with the Deputy directly on receipt of this report.</p></reply>

They stated at that time that they were the spouse of a citizen of Slovakia.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was advised on 10 March 2018 that their application had been refused.  This was because they had been found to have engaged in a fraudulent act within the meaning of the Regulations and Directive, which provide that Member States may refuse, terminate or withdraw any rights conferred under the Directive in the case of abuse of rights or fraud.  The application was refused in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 27(1) of the Regulations and Article 35 of the Directive.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the person concerned was advised their marriage to the EU citizen was considered to be one of convenience that was contracted for the sole purpose of obtaining a derived right of free movement and residence under EU law as a spouse who would not otherwise have such a right.  Therefore, their application was also refused in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 28(1) of the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The person concerned sought a review of that decision on 21 March 2018.

The bicycles are locked in prominent positions and when an attempt is made to steal the bicycle the members intercept the offender, arrest and detain them and recover the bicycle.  Follow up enquiries are conducted, which may include liaison with online retailers to ascertain if the individual has been involved in sale of bicycles on line, and follow up searches are conducted where warranted.</p><p>In addition to these targeted policing operations, on Thursday 6 September, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na launched the &ldquo;Lock it or Lose It&rdquo; campaign in response to a rise in bicycle thefts nationwide.  Launching this campaign, Garda&iacute; also provided comprehensive crime prevention advice in the hopes of substantially reducing the number of bike thefts nationwide, including advice to spend between 10% and 20% of the price of your bike on a good lock, noting the serial number on your bicycle, keeping your lock off the ground and locking your bike indoors or in a well-lit area.  The full press release and further information about this campaign can be found on the Garda website at<i>www.garda.ie.</i></p><p>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in relation to this particular form of criminality and to deploy Garda resources, including personnel, to tackle the issue.</p></reply>

These Regulations provide that all applicants must have a proven proficiency in two languages, one of which must be Irish or English.  This requirement applies without discrimination to all candidates. Such competency may be proven by achieving the relevant grades in an Irish Leaving Certificate or for English or Irish through such assessments as set out by the Public Appointments Service.  While two languages are required, applicants who do not possess proficiency in Irish but have a second language will be deemed eligible under the Regulations.  However, all Garda trainees are required to partake in and pass Irish while in the Garda College.  </p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of the Garda Commissioner, manages the initial recruitment stages for selection of Garda Trainees and I, as  Minister, have no direct involvement in the matter.  I have, however, been informed that PAS, which conducts tests as part of the competitive selection process, carefully considers all requests for reasonable accommodations.  In considering such requests, PAS is conscious of the rights of people with disabilities and of the obligations on it to observe those rights and to act in accordance with the provisions of the relevant equality legislation. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that in considering requests for reasonable accommodations, PAS has a fundamental duty to ensure it is being fair to all candidates who have entered a particular competition and that the key principle of appointment on merit is being observed.  To assist PAS in considering a request for accommodations in a fair and balanced way, its policy is to ask candidates to indicate on their application if they require special accommodations and to submit evidence in support of their request.  PAS will consider letters or reports from relevant professionals which clearly indicate the nature of the disability and the type of accommodation(s) that may be relevant to the person.  PAS has given additional time to people with dyslexia where they have supporting evidence.  However, having made reasonable accommodations, candidates must reach the required standard in order to be considered for further progression in a competition. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to recruit candidates with the appropriate qualifications to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and am committed to ensuring that best practice is followed with regard to any such recruitment.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which began its work in May 2017, is undertaking a comprehensive examination of all aspects of policing including, the appropriate composition, recruitment and training of personnel to ensure the personnel reflect the diversity of Irish society.  The Commission is due to report later this month.  The report will be considered by Government in due course and decisions taken in relation to its implementation.  </p></reply>

The onus is on the applicant to provide evidence of Irish descent or Irish association to the Minister for consideration.</p><p>Various documentation is required for applications for citizenship including evidence of age, proof of identity (passport, etc.) as well as proof of residency, such as payslips, bank statements, etc.  In relation to proof of lawful residency, for applicants residing in Northern Ireland, such information is required to be obtained from the UK immigration authorities.  Similarly, a PSNI report is required for applicants applying from Northern Ireland. </p><p>In addition Section 17(b)(ii) of the 1956 Act states that an application for a certificate of naturalisation shall be accompanied by such evidence (including statutory declarations) to vouch the application as the Minister may require. </p><p>Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation, along with the relevant application forms and guidance notes, is available on the INIS website at <i>ww.inis.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities.</p>  <p>  I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents of anti-social behaviour.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains close contact with local and senior management in Irish Rail and other transport providers.  Garda&iacute; also have a good working relationship with the public transport services providers and patrols of uniformed and plain-clothes Garda&iacute;, including personnel on foot patrols and other community engagement duties, are routinely employed when deemed appropriate by Garda management.</p>  <p>   Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  There is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13, which provides for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle this problem head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone.  Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding.  These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by society in general.  We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the number of anti-social behaviour incidents on the rail networks for the period 2015-2017, I have requested a report from the Garda authorities on this matter and I will contact the Deputies directly when the report is to hand. </p></reply>

No. 569 of 2011).  The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  As such, the Regulations make specific provision for particular categories of applicants who may be on a reduced level of income and there is no information available to either myself or Departmental officials that in general, the level of fees is discouraging people from applying for naturalisation.  In that regard, it should be noted that once a grant of naturalisation is made in respect of non-EEA nationals, they no longer are required to register their immigration permission or pay the registration fee of &euro;300 each time. </p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Regulations for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees, or for differing fees to apply to different nationalities, or based on length of residency.  While the operation of the Act is kept under review, there are no plans to amend the fees as they are comparable with other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation.  The Deputy will be aware that formal citizenship ceremonies have been introduced at no extra cost to applicants.  These have been universally well received by participants as the ceremonies provide a sense of dignity and occasion that serves to underscore the importance to both the State and the applicant of the granting of Irish citizenship.</p></reply>

In terms of providing upgraded court accommodation the refurbishment, extension and development of existing courthouses has always been the Courts Service's preference. However, while this is an option for Tralee, the scope for refurbishing and developing the existing courthouse on Ashe Street to provide the envisaged accommodation is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and the constrained nature of the site.</p><p>The Courts Service has also advised that it is currently considering a number of options for Tralee Courthouse, including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow. Previous efforts to acquire adjacent sites on Ashe Street have not been successful as the sites could not be acquired at a price that represented value for money. A further option is to build a new modern courthouse on a greenfield/brownfield site and a number of potential sites are being considered in this regard. The Courts Service has informed me that a decision has not yet been made and that all options are under review.</p><p>A number of developments in relation to Courts Service accommodation requirements are outlined in the Government's recent National Development Plan 2018 -2027. They include:</p><p>- Further new or refurbished courthouses in regional cities and county towns where facilities remain substandard (including Galway City, Wicklow Town, Portlaoise, <b>Tralee</b>and Roscommon) and further provincial locations such as An Clochan Liath (Dungloe) to serve as the Gaeltacht court for the region, and Tuam;</p><p>- Regional Family Law Centres;</p><p>- A nationwide condition survey of all court buildings in the estate will be undertaken to determine their condition and identify works required in relation to any issues identified and meet ongoing maintenance requirements.</p><p>The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period remains to be fully determined. It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective.</p></reply>

I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.</p>  <p>  Following a recommendation made by my Department's Internal Audit Committee in 2015, a Criminal Legal Aid Oversight Committee was set up.  The Committee is made up of representatives of my Department , the Courts Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Legal Aid Board.  The purpose of this Committee is to oversee and advise on the management and control of the criminal legal aid schemes and to provide a platform for the improved coordination of the respective roles of the agencies represented on the Committee.  </p>  <p>  My Department is preparing a draft General Scheme of a Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill, the key purpose of which is to transfer the administration of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to the Legal Aid Board and to give effect to Government Programme commitments in respect of criminal legal aid, including introducing a more rigorous and objective means testing system for criminal legal aid, provision for contributions, and new sanctions.   It is my intention to seek approval of Government for the General Scheme of the Bill and submit it to the Oireachtas for pre-legislative scrutiny as early as is practicable. </p></reply>

The learning derived from the pilot cell share scheme in the Midlands Prison was incorporated into the development of the new risk assessment process. This process alongside existing information contained on Prisoner Information Management allows a prison Governor to make an informed recommendation with regard to cell sharing, where a risk or need has been identified.  This Prisoner Information Management development was deployed on 21 June 2018 and is now operational in all prisons.</p>  <p>  The pillars identified for prisoner risk/needs analysis at Governor committal stage are 1. prison accommodation, 2. work/training suitability and 3. security (including escorts).  Where a prisoner specific risk or need is identified in any of these three areas, recommendations for intervention are recorded and all reasonable steps are taken by the relevant provider of this service to ensure that appropriate interventions are provided leading to a safer environment for all stakeholders including prisoners, staff, visitors, and the wider community. </p></reply>

Tattoo and body piercing shops are also currently encompassed by the HSA&rsquo;s BeSmart system (<i>),</i>which provides an online risk assessment and safety statement tool for businesses.</p><p>Tattoo inks are regulated under EU Regulations. Tattoo inks and permanent make-up are mixtures of several chemical substances. Since 2003 regulations on the use of tattoo inks were laid down by the Council of Europe.  These regulations were revised in Resolution ResAP 2008 (<i>),</i>which lists substances which should not be used in tattoo inks/permanent makeup. Inks used for tattooing should, at a minimum, fulfil those requirements. </p><p>The European Commission has recently tasked the European Chemical Agency with assessing the risks of substances in tattoo inks to human health and to also examine the need for an EU-wide restriction on their use. As a result, a restriction proposal was prepared to regulate specific hazardous substances present in tattoo inks so that they are safe.  There is no intention to ban tattoo inks or tattooing.  The restriction will significantly reduce the potential health risks for people getting new tattoos, such as allergic reactions to tattoo inks and possible long-term effects from exposure to hazardous substances injected under the skin.</p><p>Manufacturers and importers of tattoo inks must also comply with obligations under the EU REACH and CLP Regulations, which govern chemical safety. The regulations require them to register the individual substances if they are manufactured or imported in quantities at or above one tonne per year and to classify the substances so that formulators of tattoo inks can use the information to then classify the mixture and ensure the labelling and packaging requirements are also met.  Companies selling tattoo inks must provide a safety data sheet, which gives the user information on its composition and safe use. Further details on tattoo inks can be found at the ECHA webpage - <i>.</i></p><p>The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE) are also currently finalising best practice guidelines on infection prevention and control for tattooing and body piercing.  The purpose of the document is to provide guidance in relation to infection control, and is aimed at achieving the highest standards of safety and prevention.  The guidelines are expected to be published later this year. The HSA actively contributed material in relation to occupational and chemical requirements before and during the public consultation. </p><p>My Department is not considering preparing any specific legislation regarding these businesses as it is not considered necessary.  The principal issue is public health and therefore any new regulations for these businesses would be a matter for the Department of Health.</p><p>Complaints formally recorded by the HSA between 2008 and 2018 in the tattooing/ body piercing section are set out in the following table. My Department and the HSA would also point out that several of these topics including dirty needles and poor housekeeping are expected to be covered in the draft Department of Health guide on infection prevention and control for tattooing and body piercing practitioners and businesses.<table><tr><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></table>2009: Using dirty products to tattoo and pierce members of the public.</p><p>2010: Smoking in the workplace and related fire hazards.</p><p>2016: Unsafe working at height on roof of tattoo business.</p><p>2017: Dirty tattoo needles being used.</p><p>2018: Dirty tattoo needles and poor housekeeping.</p><p>Inspections carried out by the HSA at tattoo/body piercing businesses between 2008 and 2018 are set out in the following table. </p><p>As tattoo parlours/body piercing premises do not have a unique NACE (Economic Sector) code, these types of premises cannot be individually identified on the HSA&rsquo;s inspection database. The HSA&rsquo;s database does allow for employer names and location addresses to be searched using the key words, &ldquo;tattoo&rdquo; and &ldquo;piercing&rdquo; and inspections identified using these search terms returned the following list of inspections completed:<table><tr><th>2008</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that the inspection in 2016 related to construction work on a tattoo parlour and did not have any connection to the work of tattooing or body piercing.</p></reply>

Funding granted under the scheme must be used to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit.</p>  <p>  To assist businesses in responding to Brexit, Enterprise Ireland has a strong programme to build resilience in Irish exporting businesses focused on innovation, market diversification and competitiveness. To this end, EI has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit, as well as a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. As part of its Brexit awareness-raising activities, EI is rolling out regional Brexit Advisory Clinics and a national Brexit Roadshow. A two-day external Brexit consultancy support is also being rolled out to individual clients to help them develop a detailed sustainable growth plan.</p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Offices are also offering Brexit supports including a &ldquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rdquo; grant, enabling businesses to diversify into new markets, as well as tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related challenges, and targeted training on specific Brexit-related challenges. </p>  <p>  Advisory supports in relation to business planning, such as those provided by the Local Enterprise Offices and Enterprise Ireland, will be particularly important in assisting viable-but-vulnerable SMEs that may be adversely affected due to Brexit. These supports will help raise awareness of both private market financial supports and existing State supports. </p>  <p>  The Retail Consultation Forum, which I chair, provides a platform for structured engagement between representatives of the sector and Government. The Forum meets four times per year, and specific issues (e.g. skills) are also pursued through working groups, bilaterals, and information events. </p>  <p>  The Forum has proved an important means for communicating the latest updates on Brexit developments to the sector, hearing the views of retailers, and raising awareness of the supports that retailers can avail of.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department hosted a special Brexit presentation event for Forum members to hear about and discuss two pieces of recently published research: &ldquo;Ireland and the Impact of Brexit&rdquo; by Copenhagen Economics, and the ESRI research commissioned by the CCPC on &ldquo;Brexit and Irish Consumer&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Retail Consultation Forum will next meet on 20 September, and Forum members in attendance will be informed of the latest Brexit developments and discussion will focus the key issues of concern for the sector.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the potential for further shifts in the sterling exchange rate in the future, my Department continues to work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance, the SBCI, and its agencies to develop potential supports in response to the needs of businesses exposed to Brexit-related impacts. Roll out of these proposed responses is subject to resources being agreed as part of the annual budgetary process.</p>  <p>  My Department is also currently exploring the development of a Business Finance Advisory Hub service.

This report - undertaken by Indecon Economic Consultants - includes a chapter on entrepreneurial-related barriers related to difficulties in setting up a business upon return including those barriers outlined in the Deputy's question for those transferring their operations to Ireland. These include barriers to opening bank accounts, transferring driving licenses, company incorporations and the entrepreneurial-related barriers including difficulties in setting up a business upon return, (e.g. re-establishing contact &amp;amp; networks, lack of local market knowledge, knowledge of legal frameworks, lack of expertise, Government &amp;amp; non-Government supports). </p><p>This report proposes a number of recommendations aimed at alleviating these barriers. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is driving this initiative and progressing the recommendations of the report with the relevant Government Departments and agencies.</p><p>With regard to financial barriers and funding supports, my Department, through Enterprise Ireland, runs the Start in Ireland programme to attract overseas entrepreneurs to start their businesses in Ireland. EI&rsquo;s website details the supports available to overseas entrepreneurs, eligibility criteria etc.<i>. EI have launched several calls for Competitive Start Funds, with a particular focus on overseas entrepreneurs.</i></p><p><i></i>The Companies Registration Office (CRO) is the statutory authority for registering companies in Ireland. The process of incorporation and registration of a company requires delivery of a constitution, a Form A1 containing necessary details on the company and a registration fee, in accordance with the Companies Act 2014 to the Registrar of Companies. On the registration of the constitution, the Registrar will certify in writing that the company is incorporated and issue a certificate of incorporation.</p><p>The Companies Act 2014 consolidated the existing 17 Companies Acts, which date from 1963 to 2013, into one Act and introduced a number of reforms, designed to make it easier to operate a company in Ireland. The Act provides significant benefits to companies by reducing unnecessary administrative burdens and making company law obligations easier to understand.</p><p>The CRO is the central repository of public statutory information on Irish companies.  To assist anyone considering incorporation of a company, it provides an Information Leaflet on the incorporation process, available free of charge at <i>.</i></p><p><i></i>The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) also provides a Quick Guide and an Information Booklet, available free of charge at <i>.</i></p><p><i></i>Information on a range of supports available to assist companies, is available on the , <i></i>.  My Department&rsquo;s  website also includes a dedicated page on support for SMEs, available at <i>.</i></p><p><i></i>DFAT has implemented several of the Indecon Report&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to information provision.  An enhanced &lsquo;Returning to Ireland&rsquo; section, containing more information and advice for returning emigrants, has been developed for the dedicated diaspora website, the Global Irish Hub. DFAT is working closely with the Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board to ensure that returning emigrants have the best information and advice possible to assist them in making the return back to Ireland by preparing and publishing a number of advice notes for people returning to Ireland to live.  These are located on its Global Irish website here.  Under the section on finances there are notes on car insurance and on setting up bank accounts.  These aspects are within the remit of the Minister for Finance.</p><p>Minister of State Cannon has also written to all motor insurance underwriters that operate in Ireland requesting information as to their approach, with a view to further information on motor insurance for returning emigrant drivers being made available.</p><p>Details on transferring drivers&rsquo; licences are available on the NDLS website,<i>.</i>These are within the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>On the issue of insurance costs, the price of motor insurance as measured by the CPI increased by approximately 40% in the period 2014-2016, but prices have moderated in recent months.  The Government recognises that rising insurance costs for enterprise are an issue and the Minister for Finance established the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  The Group published its first Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in January 2017.  The establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, strengthening the power of PIAB in terms of addressing cases of non-cooperation and examining the frequency of the publication of the Book of Quantum, were key recommendations.</p><p>In January 2018, following approval by Government, Minister D'Arcy at the Department of Finance published the Cost of Insurance Working Group Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  This Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out. My Department in conjunction with PIAB has lead responsibility for Recommendation 9, which relates to a review of the operation of the six-month standstill period provided for in the PIAB Act 2003, with a timeline of completion by Quarter 2 of 2019.  </p><p>In December 2017, my Department published the First Report of the Personal Injuries Commission. The Report is the first phase of an eighteen-month work programme.  Implementation of the actions in this Report will help to bring more consistency to medical reporting and diagnosis of personal injuries, leading to a better functioning personal injuries environment in the future.  The Final Report of the Personal Injuries Commission deals mainly with the benchmarking of Irish personal injury award levels and an examination of alternative compensation and resolution models in other jurisdictions and makes a number of recommendations.  The purpose of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill 2018 is to amend the existing legislation to strengthen PIAB in terms of operational issues to ensure greater compliance with the PIAB process and encourage more claims to be settled through the PIAB model.  The Bill includes the recommendations from the Cost of Insurance Working Group Motor Report.</p><p>The ongoing work of the Personal Injuries Commission and the complementary work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group should contribute to a better functioning personal injury litigation system and should also help to deliver reduced premiums for businesses.</p></reply>

The following table outlines the number of IDA-supported companies by country of origin. American firms account for the largest share of multinationals with 753 companies.</p><p>The IDA has made significant progress in diversifying their portfolio of client companies that invest here.  There were, for example, 111 new name investments in 2017, an increase of 12% compared to 2016 which saw 99 new name investments. </p><p>The IDA is working hard to avail of new opportunities from our non-traditional target markets.  This includes seeking new investors from the Middle East, Africa and across Asia.  I am particularly encouraged by the progress made in recent times in securing investment from countries like China, South Korea and India.  This shows that the concerted effort that the IDA has made in growing investment from Asia is producing results in terms of new jobs here on the ground in Ireland. </p><p>While much has been accomplished in this context, the Government remains conscious of our need to continue attracting FDI from as many different countries as possible.  To diversify investment here further, we need to build awareness of Ireland as a preferred investment destination in target countries, as well as improve competitiveness and consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths in terms of talent, productivity and ease of doing business.  I am confident that this approach will help boost further the number of investors here from non-traditional markets and that we will continue to see greater geographic diversity across the IDA's client portfolio.<table><tr><th>Country of Origin</th><th>No. of companies</th></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Austria</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Bermuda</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>British Virgin Islands</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Cayman Islands</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Cyprus</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>Great Britain</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Hong Kong</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>India incl Sikkim</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Israel</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Liechtenstein</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Luxembourg</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysia </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mexico</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Nigeria</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Norway</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Russia</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Serbia</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Slovenia</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>South Africa</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>South Korea</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Sri Lanka</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Switzerland</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Taiwan</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Turkey</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>United Arab Emirates (inc.

The upper limit that the Circuit Court can impose fines on conviction up to &euro;3 million per count or imprisonment up to 2 years, while the District Court has an upper limit of &euro;5,000 fine per count on conviction or imprisonment up to 6 months. </p><p>In a number of cases in the Courts, the Judge may dismiss the case taken by the Authority. In 2016, 1 case was dismissed, 3 in 2017 and 1 in 2018.  The judge may also dismiss the case if the defendant makes a contribution to the Court poor box.

The payment amount for each alleged offence referenced in a FPN relates to the category of the alleged offence and can be &euro;100, &euro;250 or &euro;500 for category III, II and I alleged offences respectively.</p><p><sup>3</sup>Health and Safety Authority Inspectors carry out targeted inspections and investigations across all work sectors and work activities that come under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Chemicals Act 2008.  Most inspections are targeted at the high risk sectors such as construction, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, health care, mines, quarries, transport of dangerous goods by road, or the chemical sectors.  Other inspections can be part of a particular safety awareness campaign e.g. on manual handling, on slips, trips or falls or on compliance with the REACH Regulation. </p><p><sup>4 </sup>Each year the HSA carries out approximately 200 investigations.  These investigations include all fatal accidents and selected serious accidents which are connected to work activities.  Furthermore approximately 800 investigations of complaints made by workers and members of the public about workplace health and safety issues are carried out annually.  These investigations are included in the above figures. </p><p>Over 90% of the targeted inspections and complaint investigations carried out by the HSA are unannounced. In the case of accident investigations the majority of these are announced.  This is to ensure that the appropriate persons are available to the investigating inspector at the workplace for providing information, being interviewed as witnesses and for providing statements.  Some follow up inspections may also be announced when these involve checking for compliance with a previously served Prohibition or Improvement Notice.</p></reply>

That review, inter alia, identified certain skill deficiencies, as a consequence of which sanction was sought, and subsequently obtained, to recruit a number of additional professional staff to address the identified need. </p><p>Further to that process, the Department, through the Public Appointments Service, recruited six suitably qualified and experienced forensic accountants (although one was later successful in another recruitment campaign) together with a suitably qualified and experienced digital forensics specialist, for assignment to the ODCE. </p><p>Over recent years, a number of senior-level vacancies have arisen within the ODCE through a combination of retirement, promotion and transfer to other parts of the public service. In that context, the skill sets, competencies, roles and responsibilities associated with each of those posts have been reviewed and reconfigured by the Director to better reflect the organisation&rsquo;s current needs. That exercise has resulted in two senior-level professional posts of Enforcement Portfolio Manager being created. Both of these posts having been filled through recruitment campaigns led by the Public Appointments Service. Public Appointments Service ran a recruitment campaign for the positions of Enforcement Lawyer and two remaining Forensic Accountant (Professional Accountant Grade 1) positions on 26th January 2018. One Enforcement Lawyer was appointed to the ODCE on 11th June 2018 and the second will be appointed on 1st October, 2018 . Two Forensic Accountants were identified from this competition and one was appointed on 8th May 2018 and the second on 23rd July 2018.</p><p>The ODCE also has an approved complement of seven members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (one Detective Inspector, two Detective Sergeants and four Detective Garda&iacute;). At this time, there is one vacancy in that approved complement, i.e., the Detective inspector post. The filling of that post is a matter for the Commissioner.</p></reply>

Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges.  The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p>  <p>   Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number.  Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank.  Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.   </p>  <p>  From the launch of the scheme on 28 March 2018 to the end of June 2018, the SBCI  received 151 applications.  Of these, 132 have been deemed eligible and can proceed to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.  10 SMEs have progressed to sanction at finance provider level to a total value of &euro;2.49 million.</p>  <p>   The Department will receive a report each quarter from the SBCI on the uptake of the scheme.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Brexit Loan Scheme is only one of a wide range of supports offered by my Department and its Agencies to help businesses prepare for Brexit.</p></reply>

The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p><p>The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories:  Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand.  (It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses).  In addition, there is a Technical Assistance Grant available for eligible micro-exporter applicants who are seeking to explore alternative markets for their product or service.</p><p>For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); a mentor to work with the business proposer; or targeted programmes such as Lean for Micro (to help boost business productivity and competitiveness).</p><p>Micro-enterprises may also avail of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) from the LEOs.  The Scheme offers the opportunity for businesses to develop their website or digital marketing strategy by availing of vouchers of up to &euro;2,500 or 50% of eligible expenditure.</p><p>Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.</p><p>I should also draw your attention to the &lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; Online Tool, which is a cross-governmental initiative to help start-ups navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible.  The tool is available at <i>www.supportingsmes.ie</i>.  By answering the eight questions in the Online Tool, a small business will, in one location, be able to:</p><p>- find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them;</p><p>- obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit;</p><p>- identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further;</p><p>- download all these filtered results into a document for their further use. </p><p>For further information on LEO supports see <i>.</i></p></reply>

The employment permits system is managed in part through the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL) for the purposes of granting an employment permit.  </p>  <p>  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research compiled in the annual National Skills Bulletin and the annual Vacancy Overview Report, which is undertaken by the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs, the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SOLAS) and coordinated by the National Skills Council.  This data, in tandem with a public consultation process which will involve the submission of evidence based cases for inclusion on, or removal from the HSEOL and ICEL, to the appropriate Government Department by sectoral stakeholders, will form the basis of the bi-annual review process.  </p>  <p>  Since a review of the lists completed in 2015, Chiropractors (who are members of the Chiropractic Association of Ireland) were removed from the Ineligible List and became eligible for a General Employment Permit.  This permit type is the primary vehicle used by the State to attract third country nationals for occupations experiencing a labour or skills shortage and holders are eligible to apply for family reunification with the Department of Justice and Equality after 12 months.   </p>  <p>  My Department recently conducted a review of economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system and the report is due to be published shortly with a review of the lists of occupations for employment permits scheduled to commence in the Autumn.  </p>  <p>  In order to consider an occupation for inclusion on the HSEOL, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claim as part of a detailed evidence-based case which would be forwarded by the Department of Health as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration.</p></reply>

Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges.

The move to real-time reporting is the most significant change to the PAYE system since its introduction more than fifty years ago. The modernisation programme will bring improved accuracy and transparency for all stakeholders, including employers, employees and Revenue, while also significantly streamlining the entire administration process. </p>  <p>  The new real-time reporting requirements will simplify the PAYE reporting process for employers and their agents by eliminating various forms (e.g. P.30, P.45, P60) which are currently required.  For the most part the new reporting requirements will seamlessly integrate with the existing payroll process without any additional burden on the current employer.  Revenue is working very closely with the Payroll Software Developers Association to design the employer payroll reporting requirements.  </p>  <p>  Employers who do not use payroll software will be able to comply with the requirements by completing a simple online form on ROS, the data required is in line with what they are currently required to provide on an employee&rsquo;s payslip under employment law.</p>  <p>  I am assured that Revenue is also conscious of the very small minority (0.3%) of employers who are unable to use online services. These would typically include situations where internet access is insufficient, or where the employer is elderly or suffers from a disability. Such employers can apply to be excluded from the obligation to submit PAYE returns online and Revenue will make specific arrangements to facilitate manual reporting using customised stationery, to record and submit employees&rsquo; payroll information in hard copy.</p>  <p>  One of the main advantages of the new real-time reporting arrangements is that employees, employers, and Revenue, will always have the most accurate and up-to-date information available in respect of pay and statutory deductions. For example, in the context of an increasing variety of employments, where people change jobs more frequently and multiple concurrent employments are more commonplace, the availability of this information will assist Revenue in ensuring that each employee gets the full benefit of her/his entitlements each year, particularly if s/he has more than one employment. The current annual (P35) system does not facilitate this and can leave employees at a disadvantage because information is captured on an annual (historic) basis, rather than in real-time.</p>  <p>  In terms of communicating the message to all employers, Revenue has been actively engaged in information briefing sessions nationwide. Since January 2017 to date, Revenue teams have presented at over 240 PAYE focused events for a variety of stakeholders including the Small Firms Association, The Irish Farmers Association, Chartered Accountants Institute, Irish Taxation Institute, Age Action, Payroll Providers, Tax Agents and many other representative bodies.</p>  <p>  I also understand that Revenue has written to every registered employer in the country and is currently engaged in a large number of regional customer service visits to assist employers with their preparations for PAYE Modernisation.  Revenue Seminars are planned for September and October as well as an extensive advertising campaign.</p>  <p>  My officials have engaged with Revenue on this matter and will continue to monitor the impact of the new requirements on businesses of all sizes.  In 2017, the Revenue Commissioners gave a presentation and hosted a question and answer session for members of the Advisory Group on Small Business (AGSB) on the new PAYE reporting requirements. The AGSB (chaired by Minister Breen) is the principal conduit for SMEs and their representative groups to interact with my Department. It is envisaged that Revenue will attend future meetings of the AGSB for further discussions and to receive feedback on the new system. </p></reply>

When comparing year-on-year data, our overall participation rate has increased by 0.5 percent to 62.3 percent. The male participation rate has shown a slight increase (0.1 percent) to bring total male participation to 68.6 percent. The female participation rate has increased by 0.8 percent to bring the total to 56.4 percent. This level of female participation is the highest rate that has been recorded in Ireland since Q3 2009. </p>  <p>  In order to make accurate EU comparisons, data is taken from Eurostat&rsquo;s EU Labour Force Survey as published for 2017. This data shows that female participation in Ireland in 2017 was 55.7 percent. This is significantly higher than the 2017 EU average of 51.8 percent. This data identifies Sweden as the country with the highest female participation rate (62.1 percent) in Europe and Italy as the country with the lowest female participation rate (40.9 percent). </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of enhancing female participation rates in the labour market. Increasing female participation in the labour market provides us with the potential to both deliver significant social and gender equality benefits, and to address the growing need for skills and talent. With this in mind, the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 has a dedicated action aimed at facilitating female participation in employment. Action 28 aims to identify relevant policy issues for cohorts with low participation rates based on analysis of patterns of labour market participation. My Department is leading on this action and work is currently underway. It is expected that this study will be completed by the end of this year.</p></reply>

This has been a key priority for the body since the decision by the UK to leave the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Advisory Service was established in May 2017 to provide a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships on account of Brexit. The service includes a range of tailored supports to help businesses prepare for the challenges ahead.  As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. ITI also offers vouchers which enable companies to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &pound;2000/&euro;2000 (inclusive of VAT) each.</p>  <p>  ITI has incurred expenditure of &pound;220,000, which is approximately &euro;244,000, on advertising and promotion for their Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure to promote their &lsquo;Be Prepared&rsquo; grant amounts to &euro;7,000, which was incurred in respect of digital media platforms only.

The HSE has completed the first phase of their work in relation to the 50 agencies identified as part of the WRC process.  This exercise has shown that of the agencies who returned data, a majority did apply pay reductions of some form.  It also showed that some agencies made some form of pay restoration between 2016 and 2018. </p>  <p>  Two conciliation meetings took place between the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission in July 2018.  Regrettably, the unions withdrew from this process and SIPTU has indicated its intention to proceed with industrial action on 18 September 2018.  </p>  <p>  My Department remains willing to return to discussions at the Workplace Relations Commission.</p></reply>

The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school.

The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and to deliver improved services and supports.  The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE.  The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year. Plans are progressing to further implement the Dementia Strategy through the National Dementia Office, including in the area of diagnosis, post-diagnostic supports and care pathways.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports.  It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered.  The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.  There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country.  The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites.  The appointment of additional dementia advisers will be considered when the results of an evaluation are available. </p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, provide expert knowledge and leadership, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice.  Work is under way to further determine the scope and requirements for this role.</p>  <p>  As part of the Dementia Understand Together campaign, a national community activation coordinator has been recruited to ensure that the campaign translates into dementia inclusive communities on the ground, including by fostering local dementia champions.  The Department of Health has secured Dormant Accounts funding to allow this post to continue until the end of 2019. </p>  <p>  With regard to the provision of additional resources, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Since 2009 HIQA have maintained a register of all nursing homes whether public or private.  This can be accessed through the HIQA website.  All nursing homes are expected to provide person-centred, safe and effective services for all residents, including those with dementia.   </p>  <p>  Sheltered housing developments for older people are not required to register with HIQA, do not come within the remit of the Minister for Health, and the Department of Health is not therefore in a position to supply the details regarding numbers and occupancy levels requested.   </p>  <p>  The Government intends to establish a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services.  The Department of Health is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this.  The statutory scheme for home support will introduce clear rules in relation to the services for which individuals are eligible and in relation to how decisions are made on allocating services. It will therefore be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home support services. It will also help to improve access to services, in an affordable and sustainable way. The system of regulation for home support will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided, whether they are living in their own home or they living in a form of sheltered accommodation are of a high standard.  In the meantime, the HSE has taken steps to improve the quality of Home Support Services provided by it, whether directly or indirectly.   </p>  <p>  The Department, in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is currently exploring policy options including supporting housing/housing with care so that older people have a wider range of housing options and choices available to them. A cross Department/Agency steering group chaired by the DHPLG and comprising the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, the Housing Agency and other key stakeholders was established in 2017 to consider the issues and provide guidance on drafting a joint policy statement on housing options for older people. The draft statement is currently being finalised.   </p>  <p>  This will be a first step in the broader process of seeking to provide older people with appropriate accommodation options that are suited to their needs. The policy statement will set out a framework by which the Government can facilitate housing, including housing with care, for older people having regard to current demographics and looking at best practice models. The aim is to ensure that people can grow old and live in a community of their choosing, with dignity and independence.   </p>  <p>  In November I intend to host a joint expert conference on housing for older people, together with the Minister of State with responsibility for Housing and Urban Renewal. The conference will identify and discuss a range of issues including opportunities, barriers and enablers to guide future development of housing and support needs for older people.</p></reply>

Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to persons granted registration.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters, and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system. </p>  <p>  These bodies are collectively known as CORU and are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  CORU is also charged with the promotion of high standards of professional conduct, professional education, training and competence among the registrants</p>  <p>  The grade of Assistant Psychologist is not an established grade in the Irish healthcare system.  This grade has been introduced in the HSE on a two-year pilot basis only. Decisions in relation to the future of the grade will be made on completion of the pilot.  Therefore, there are no plans at present to regulate the title of Assistant Psychologist. </p></reply>

Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time.  A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE through the community drugs schemes, it must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the 2016 Framework Agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), whether to add the medicine to the reimbursement list, agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse it.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p>  <p>  I have indicated a willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

At my request, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is preparing a report which will make recommendations in relation to the clinical and technical issues involved.  I am informed that following policy actions in relation to mesh by health authorities in the NHS and in Northern Ireland in July 2018, as set out below, further engagements with the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Agency, the professional bodies and colleagues in other jurisdictions were needed for the purpose of finalising the report.  I am informed that the CMO&rsquo;s Report is anticipated to be completed in the coming weeks.</p><p>Pending finalisation of the report, a number of significant system actions in relation to mesh implants have already been advanced.</p><p>The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the Health Service Executive on 20 July 2018 to request that the Executive put immediate measures in place to: <ol type="1"><li>Pause the use of all procedures involving uro-gynaecological/transvaginal mesh implants for the management of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in HSE funded hospitals, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so.</li> <li>Ensure that in situations where expert clinical judgment is that there is an urgency to carry out the procedure and no suitable alternative exists, surgery should proceed only if a delay would risk harm to the patient and should be based on multidisciplinary team decision and fully informed consent.</li></ol>This pause is to remain in place pending confirmation of implementation by the Health Service Executive, working in conjunction with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), of three urgent recommendations relating to:</p><p>(i)Surgical Training, </p><p>(ii)  Informed Consent and </p><p>(iii) the Development of an agreed Dataset of Mesh Procedures.</p><p>The Department also wrote to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Continence Foundation of Ireland on requesting that they assist the HSE in progressing these recommendations on an urgent basis.</p><p>The HSE has published information for patients on its website concerning the pause.</p><p>It is acknowledged that there may be concerns that restricting the availability of mesh procedures, particularly SUI mesh procedures, which are widely accepted to be less invasive and more effective than non-mesh alternatives will delay access to treatment procedures for distressing symptoms.  Advice received in relation to this is that uro-gynaecological mesh procedures are largely elective procedures and it is not anticipated that a postponement of weeks / months will materially affect health outcomes for the majority of women affected. Given the limited number of surgeons and units carrying out these procedures in HSE funded hospitals, it is anticipated that the Executive will be in a position to indicate to the Department that these recommendations have been implemented within a number of months.</p><p>The decision to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures in HSE funded hospitals followed a review by Department officials, together with representatives of the HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), of the NHS England decision of Tuesday 10 July to institute a similar &lsquo;pause&rsquo; in their use.  This decision in the NHS followed a recommendation by the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety (IMMDS) Review established in February 2018 by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the Rt. Hon Jeremy Hunt MP.  On Wednesday July 11, a pause was instigated by health authorities in Northern Ireland. </p><p>It has been clarified by the NHS that there is no concurrent change in the evidence base concerning these devices.  The recommendations of the IMMDS to NHS England arose because of a lack of certainty or confidence that critical clinical governance measures to assure the safety of mesh procedures are demonstrably in place.  The Department considers that similar concerns in relation to the visibility and consistency of such measures apply equally in the public health system here.</p><p>There is understandable public and patient anxiety about the ongoing safety of mesh devices in light of the considerable publicity that this issue has received and this has been heightened by recent developments in the NHS.  It is important that this be addressed as comprehensively as possible.  A pause on the use of mesh procedures, pending confirmation by the Executive that the recommendations as set out above have been implemented, is considered proportionate and necessary to provide public assurance that these procedures are being carried out in accordance with internationally accepted good practice. </p><p>The advice of the HPRA to the Department is that it is supports a temporary restriction on all procedures involving uro-gynaecological/transvaginal mesh implants, pending the introduction of the further clinical mechanisms proposed relating to the delivery of care for patients.  The regulatory status of uro-gynaecological mesh implants at a European level remains unchanged in that they are CE marked medical devices.  As such, the benefit-risk profile for the devices is considered positive.  Ensuring that the use of transvaginal mesh is appropriate and as safe as possible requires, not only that the device is safe and performs as intended, but also that the healthcare system has appropriate measures for patient selection, treatment and follow-up in place. </p><p>In relation to the provision of appropriate aftercare for women suffering from mesh complications, including appropriate diagnostic facilities, this has already been identified as one of two priority recommendations for immediate advancement by the Executive in the course of preparation of the CMO&rsquo;s report.  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the HSE, and to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG), the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), and the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) on May 28 2018,  requesting that the Executive commence work on (i) the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials and (ii) clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications, in conjunction with the IOG, the RCSI and the CFI.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that work has commenced by the National Women and Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in the HSE to progress all of the recommendations above.  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications.  This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website.</p><p>The experiences of women concerned will be an essential element to informing the assessment of need and identifying the aftercare services required.  I am informed that a Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations.</p><p>This work is ongoing and will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services.  It will also include an examination of the role of and requirement for specialist diagnostic services such as translabial scanning.  The outcome of this work will clarify if there is a need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any shortfalls identified at national level, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p><p>The HSE advice is that all patients who have experienced complications due to mesh devices are advised to contact their consultant&rsquo;s clinic in the first instance.  Each hospital group has nominated an individual to coordinate a response to this group of patients.  If patients are having trouble accessing information they can contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at smi.nwihp@hse.ie for help.</p><p>For all patients wishing to access services abroad there are two potential schemes which may be available to patients, namely the Treatment Abroad Scheme and the Cross-Border Directive.  Details of the qualifying criteria for both schemes may be found on the HSE website - details below.  </p><p>It is important to note that both schemes are only applicable for patients accessing care via the public patient pathway.  Referrals of private patients or from private hospital consultants are not eligible for consideration under TAS for example, nor can an outpatient appointment in a private capacity be accepted for the purposes of access healthcare under the Cross-Border Directive, however, for the purposes of the Cross-Border Directive, a GP may refer a patient for an out-patient appointment abroad.</p><p>It is open to private patients to apply their private health insurance provider in relation to accessing funding towards the cost of treatment abroad.  However, if this request for assistance is declined a patient can seek to access treatment through either of the above schemes if they follow the public patient pathway.</p><p>Details of both the TAS and CBD can be accessed on the HSE&rsquo;s website or by contacting the office on 056 778 4551.</p></reply>

Minister Daly hopes to progress legislation in the Oireachtas in the autumn session.</p>  <p>  The impact of potential changes to the NHSS will be considered as part of Budget 2019, with changes expected to take effect next year. It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period.</p></reply>

The New Maternity Hospital at the St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital Campus will be the first of these to be developed, with the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital and University Maternity Hospital, Limerick to follow in time. </p>  <p>  The National Maternity Strategy, published in January 2016, reaffirms the commitment to the provision of maternity services on the St James's Campus and the tri-location of adult, children&rsquo;s and maternity services at St James&rsquo;s will create a centre of healthcare excellence for patients of all ages.</p>  <p>  The relocation of the Coombe Hospital to the St James's site is at an early stage and has yet to progress to planning and design phases.  Construction of the new children's hospital is currently underway on the St James&rsquo;s site and construction of the new maternity hospital on that site will not commence until after the new children's hospital is completed.  I can confirm, however, that the new children's hospital design has incorporated the required operational links with both the maternity and adult hospitals and that a site for the proposed maternity hospital is identified in the St James's campus Master Plan.</p></reply>

An Advisory Group comprised of key stakeholders has been formed to consider the findings of the public consultation, advise on appropriate amendments to the draft Heads of Bill and ensure that the approach taken integrates effectively with existing legislation.  Every effort is being made to progress the legislation as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

More than 1,000 cases of confirmed Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza were hospitalised and 100 people were admitted to Intensive Care Units.  There were 29 deaths, all but two of which were in &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups and most had other significant underlying medical conditions.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health activated the National Plan for Pandemic Influenza and, based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups were prioritised for vaccination.  Vaccination of children was prioritised as the rates of influenza were highest in those groups at that time.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010.  Over 1.1 million pandemic vaccinations were recorded giving a 25% uptake for the total population.  Since the 2010/2011 influenza season H1N1 has been incorporated in the seasonal flu vaccine used in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A copy of the report can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website: health.gov.ie/blog/publications/final-report-of-the-national-narcolepsy-study-steering-committee-2/. </p></reply>

The Authority has not, to date, found any falsified (including counterfeit) medicine within the legitimate supply chain that has reached patient level.  It has identified and investigated falsified medicines transacted through a small number of wholesalers and, in each case, the medicines concerned were not subsequently sold into the Irish market.  The HPRA does not have any remit under intellectual property enforcement legislation and does not keep records under the heading &lsquo;counterfeit medications&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  In co-operation with Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HPRA detains significant quantities of illegally supplied medicines.  An amount of these are known to be falsified. In 2017, the HPRA initiated six prosecutions that included falsified medicines, only one of which involved a wholesaler that was authorised when the activity took place, and the remainder were supplies that took place outside the legitimate supply chain.  Since 2015, the HPRA has initiated a total of 15 prosecutions that involved falsified medicines. </p>  <p>  The HPRA also works with other regulatory and law enforcement agencies worldwide in relation to the illegal manufacture, importation and distribution of medicines, medical devices, cosmetics and other health products.  This includes participation in Operation Pangea, an Interpol-coordinated international operation against illegal supply, including trafficking, of unauthorised prescription medicines and medical devices via online and social media channels.</p></reply>

The applicant can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs. </p>  <p>  Dementia is an umbrella term for loss of memory and other cognitive abilities severe enough to interfere with daily life, caused by physical changes in the brain. There are over 400 different types of dementia. Not all people with dementia who are being cared for in a nursing home reside in a Specialist Care Unit (SCU) for dementia. Whilst the majority of nursing home residents have some type of cognitive impairment or dementia, only a small proportion of nursing homes operate an SCU for dementia. </p>  <p>  The HSE estimate that the current average price for a private/voluntary bed in the NHSS is &euro;1,000 per week, a 5% increase would result in an increase of &euro;50 per bed per week. As there are approximately 17,475 people being supported in private/voluntary nursing homes under the NHSS, a general increase in the NTPF agreed rate would amount to an additional weekly cost of &euro;873,750. </p></reply>

An additional &euro;9 million has been provided to the HSE in 2018 specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including further increasing access to scoliosis services.  The increased investment in the service in 2018 will stabilise and expand the current capacity to meet the demand for timely scoliosis treatment. In 2018, the Children's Hospital Group (CHG) aims to deliver 447 procedures, compared to 371 in 2017 and 224 in 2016.</p><p>The HSE operates two schemes which facilitate patients accessing treatments abroad.  The first is the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) which applies where the treatment is not available in the Irish Republic hospital system. </p><p>The second is under the Cross Border Directive (CBD) and reimburses patients for treatments received in another EU/EEA Member State where the treatment is one which is provided in Ireland.  The HSE provides information for patients on the CBD and TAS on its website which can be accessed at <i></i>schemes and also through the HSE TAS and CBD Office.  The contact details are: HSE TAS and CBD Office, St Canices, Laken, Dublin Road, Kilkenny, R95 P231. Ph: 056 778 4551. e-mail: <i>treatmentabroadscheme@hse.ie</i>.

A key component of the management of waiting lists by hospitals is the categorisation of patients by clinical priority to ensure that all patients receive care in a timely and clinically appropriate matter. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I approved the establishment of a Central Waiting List Validation function in the NTPF.  The new office will consolidate and centralise validation activity for all Inpatient/Daycase and Outpatient waiting lists, thus ensuring a standardisation of approach across all waiting lists and all hospitals. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE is working with the NTPF and my Department to finalise the Outpatient Action Plan for 2018.  This plan will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with their National Service Plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services, improve the accuracy of the waiting list, and trial a number of NTPF funded interventions, including weekend and out of hours clinics.</p>  <p>  In relation to urology appointments in UHG, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-07a.2233.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018090700042#WRPP00500"><p>Currently, patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  There is also a limited specialist AHR service available through the HSE, which provides funding for fertility preservation for cancer patients whose treatment is likely to impact on their future fertility. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill on assisted human reproduction (AHR) and associated areas of research in October last year.  The introduction of legislation in relation to AHR and associated research is a priority for me and officials in my Department are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the process of drafting this Bill.  The General Scheme is published on my Department&rsquo;s website and the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of this year.   </p>  <p>  In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department are working with the HSE over the course of this year in developing a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.   </p>  <p>  Part of this work includes identifying policy options for a public funding model for AHR treatment.  Once I have had the opportunity to consider these policy options I will bring a Memorandum to Government in relation to a model of care for infertility, including public funding for AHR treatment, for the Government's consideration.   </p>  <p>  It should be noted that any funding model that may ultimately be introduced would need to operate within the broader regulatory framework set out in the AHR Bill and a model of care for infertility.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-07a.2238.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018090700042#WRPP01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 787, 790 and 809 together.  </p>  <p>  A Healthy Weight for Ireland&rsquo;, the Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP), was launched in September 2016 under the auspices of the Healthy Ireland agenda.  </p>  <p>  The OPAP covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  Indeed it must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this.  </p>  <p>  The policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity.  A new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group was established in October 2017.  The current position with implementing these is as follows:</p>  <p>  1. Embed multi-sectoral actions on obesity prevention with the support of government departments and public sector agencies</p>  <p>  An Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) has been established under the Chair of the Department of Health.  It is comprised of representatives from the following Departments and Agencies: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Children and Youth Affairs; Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; University College Cork; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Health Service Executive (HSE) - including the National Clinical Lead for Obesity; and Safefood.  The OPIOG held its inaugural meeting on the 19th of October last with further meetings arranged at agreed intervals for the purposes of providing oversight to the implementation of the national Obesity Policy &amp;amp; Action Plan (OPAP).  The OPIOG will identify processes for engaging with networks of stakeholders.  It will elaborate on this aspect of its functions over the course of its work to implement the OPAP that runs up to 2025.  Ultimately, it is under the umbrella of the OPIOG  that the overarching ten steps forward and the individual actions listed in the OPAP under these steps are being largely implemented.  </p>  <p>  The OPAP recommended that proposals be developed relating to the rollout of evidence based fiscal measures, including a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks, in support of healthy eating.  As the Deputy is aware the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax commenced on the 1st of May.  It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity.  </p>  <p>  2. Regulate for a healthier environment</p>  <p>  The development of legislation for calorie posting to support people to make healthy choices is underway by the Department of Health.  Currently, a behaviour study on how best to make the posting of calories meaningful to customers and more likely to impact on their behaviours is being carried out by the ESRI.  In addition, actions in this area are being progressed through engagement with other Government Departments to support the work of stakeholders involved in planning and developing the built environment.  </p>  <p>  In line with Actions 31 and 59 of the National Physical Activity Plan, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity (31), and to develop a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement to ensure delivery of the Plan (59), it is intended to hold a Stakeholder Forum in November this year.  The planned Forum will focus on the theme of the Built Environment. </p>  <p>  Planning for the Forum is at an advanced stage, and a number of individuals have been approached with regard to giving presentations.  A wide range of stakeholders will be invited to the Forum, comprising key representatives from health, sport, planning, environment, local government and others. Full details of the Forum will be available once finalised.  </p>  <p>  3. Secure appropriate support from the commercial sector to play its part in obesity prevention</p>  <p>  At its inaugural meeting, the OPIOG agreed to establish two sub-groups for Reformulation and Healthy Eating.  Both sub-groups have met on a number of occasions since being established and agreed their Terms of Reference.  </p>  <p>  The Reformulation sub-group will be technical in its work programme.  The work of the sub-group will primarily set targets on reformulation of food and drink. It will also make recommendations on addressing reduction of portion sizes and on monitoring and validation procedures.  </p>  <p>  One of the priority actions under Step 3 of the OPAP was to &lsquo;Establish a forum for meaningful engagement with industry on best practice initiatives towards a healthy food environment&rsquo;.  It is intended to progress this action under the auspices of the OPIOG in 2018.  And in this regard, a workshop between the Reformulation sub-group of the OPIOG and Food Sector Stakeholders on reformulation is scheduled for the 20th of September next.  The intention is that this workshop will provide an opportunity for detailed engagement with key Food Sector Stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of reformulation in the interest of promoting the health and wellbeing of the population.  </p>  <p>  A code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship has also been developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments.  It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The Codes of Practice concerned were published in February. In line with the Principles of Governance specified in the Codes of Practice, the process to designate a monitoring body by the Minister for Health is continuing and I expect that it shall be well advanced over the next quarter of 2018.  The development of guidance on the Codes is also featuring in this process.  </p>  <p>  4. Implement a strategic and sustained communications strategy that empowers individuals, communities and service providers to become obesity aware and equipped to change, with a particular focus on families with children in the early years</p>  <p>  The previously launched Healthy Ireland 2018 campaign seeks to encourage people to get out and get active together this summer &ndash; whether walking with a group, visiting some of our many parks and heritage sites with family or sharing a salad or summer fruit with friends.  Building on January&rsquo;s Healthy Ireland 2018 campaign, which encouraged people to make a small, healthy change, the Summer campaign highlights the benefits of making those changes with others &ndash; getting out and feeling good together.  Research shows that starting a healthy habit with someone, such as a family member, friend or colleague, is more likely to last than if you do it alone.  </p>  <p>  A new child obesity campaign from Safefood and the HSE was recently launched.  It's called the START campaign and it aims to inspire, empower and support parents to start building and persist with healthy lifestyle habits in the family to prevent childhood obesity.  The first phase of the campaign advertising features on TV, radio, video on demand, outdoor and digital platforms.  The next phase of the campaign was launched in April.  </p>  <p>  5. The Department of Health, through Healthy Ireland, will provide leadership, engage and co-ordinate multi-sectoral action and implement best practice in the governance of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan</p>  <p>  As referred to at step 1 above, the establishment of an Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group is well advanced. New Healthy Eating Guidelines, Food Pyramid and supporting resources have already been published, disseminated and communicated in 2017, including dissemination of the new Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools.  </p>  <p>  Work has also commenced on developing Healthy Eating Guidelines for the 1-5 year old age group.  As a first step in this work, the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) is currently developing scientific recommendations for food based dietary guidelines for 1 to 5 year olds.  </p>  <p>  New Nutrition Standards for schools, with an initial focus on school meal programmes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, have also been developed.  These Nutrition Standards were published in September 2017.  The Nutrition Standards were developed by the Department of Health with the assistance of Safefood and the Health Service Executive, in cooperation with the members of the School Meals Programme in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills.  </p>  <p>  6. Mobilise the health services to better prevent and address overweight and obesity through effective community-based health promotion programmes, training and skills development and through enhanced systems for detection and referrals of overweight and obese patients at primary care level</p>  <p>  A Healthy Eating, Active Living Programme has been established as a Policy Priority Programme within the HSE and a three-year plan for the programme has been finalised.  The GP contract for the provision of free care to children under 6 years, already provides that the medical practitioner shall take an active approach toward promoting health and preventing disease through the provision of periodic assessments to child patients.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is also implementing a Breastfeeding Action Plan and a new Making Every Contact Count brief intervention framework which aims to capitalise on the opportunities that occur every day within the health service to support people to make healthy lifestyle choices.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of nutrition in hospitals, the HSE is developing a Food, Nutrition and Hydration Policy for Adult Patients, Staff and Visitors in Acute Hospitals.  Consultation on the policy has been completed and comments are currently being reviewed.  The policy will apply to all locations in Acute Hospitals including Inpatient wards, Emergency Departments, Day Procedure Units as well as all facilities providing food and beverages for staff and visitors.  The aim is to improve the quality and safety of food, nutritional and hydration care in our hospitals.  </p>  <p>  7. Develop a service model for specialist care for children and adults</p>  <p>  Professor Donal O&rsquo;Shea was appointed the National Clinical Lead for Obesity.  This appointment will be important in further advancing the implementation of many of the recommendations in the OPAP including the development of a national integrated service model for the health and social care of overweight and obese people and for developing quality assurance guidance for obesity services.  </p>  <p>  8. Acknowledge the key role of physical activity in the prevention of overweight and obesity</p>  <p>  'Get Ireland Active! The National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland' (NPAP) is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, and implementation of that Plan is well underway in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of other stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  9. Allocate resources according to need, in particular to those population groups most in need of support in the prevention and management of obesity, with particular emphasis on families and children during the first 1,000 days of life</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Healthy Eating and Active Living Plan within the HSE will begin to address this action area, with a particular focus on supporting parents and families.  </p>  <p>  10. Develop a multi-annual research programme that is closely allied to policy actions, invest in surveillance and evaluate progress on an annual basis</p>  <p>  The establishment of the national oversight structure referred to earlier will foster developments under this step of the OPAP.</p></reply>

I understand that the Programme has approved the appointment of an additional 28 ultrasonographers which was the total requirement identified to provide 100% access to anomaly scanning.  </p>  <p>  Pending the completion of the requisite recruitment and training processes, I am assured that the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.  The Programme is also working with the Maternity Networks to ensure foetal medicine expertise is available when an anomaly is identified.  In relation to the status of anomaly scan provision at the Midlands Regional Hospital, Mullingar, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.</p></reply>

The expert group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970. as amended, eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  </p></reply>

Detailed work is underway in the Department of Health, to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit.  This includes contingency planning for all possible scenarios.</p>  <p>  The Irish and UK Governments are committed to maintaining the reciprocal rights of access to healthcare for both Irish and UK citizens to publicly funded health services. Technical discussions, involving the Department's of Health from Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK on how to maintain these arrangements post-Brexit are currently ongoing includes work on the Cross Border Directive.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that at present there are no changes to patient care, as the UK continues to be a full member of the EU. Indeed until the UK formally withdraws from the European Union, it remains a full Member with all of its existing rights and obligations.</p></reply>

This is reflected through significant increases in the funding committed to this area. The HSE Mental Health budget has been increased by over &euro;200 million since 2012. Around &euro;911 million has been provided for the Executive this year. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises the need to provide effective and timely care for those in need. The range of services raised by the Deputy continue to be developed as part of implementation of A Vision for Change, and are reflected in the agreed HSE annual Service Plans.</p>  <p>  In relation to crisis access to mental health services, steps were initially taken to progress the improved out-of-hours access to mental health services initiative in 2017. The HSE mapped all  114 Adult Mental Teams to determine the existing level of 7/7 service provision. The results of this exercise showed that there currently is approximately 60% coverage across the nine CHOs of 7/7 cover comprising of a combination of Assertive Outreach, Home-Based Treatment Teams and nurse-provided cover.</p>  <p>  As part of Programme for Government funding in 2017, approximately &euro;4.5 million was sought and was granted for the staffing and non-staffing costs associated with an enhanced service. A consultation process with all nine CHOs then took place to agree staffing numbers and professions. The HSE is now in final stages of recruiting staff required to deliver 7/7 Mental Health service cover for the areas that do not currently have a service in place. The HSE have recruited approximately 50% of the additional staff required to provide a countrywide 7/7 Mental Health service, with interviews for remaining posts completed around mid-August last. </p>  <p>  Additional approaches are also being considered to ensure that those in need of services and support can access these services in the most effective way. It is likely that the future development in Digital response to Mental Health issues will form a part of the overall response. I am strongly supportive of the increased use of technology in the delivery of mental health services, particularly that relating to Prevention and Early Intervention. I am progressing a tele-psychiatry pilot project to ascertain the merits of delivering care from a distance using technology and video-conferencing.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. In order to fully capture the experience of demonstrator sites and inform the future development of this service, the National Dementia Office commissioned an external evaluation of the service. The evaluation, by University College Cork, began in November 2017 and is expected to be finalised by September 2018. Initial results indicate that a majority of people with dementia are satisfied with the information, advice, support and signposting provided by dementia advisers. The service has brought normality to their lives, provided understanding about dementia and given people with dementia the confidence to ask questions. The appointment of additional dementia advisers will be considered when the results of this evaluation are available. </p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice. It is proposed that the key worker will be responsible for the coordinated planning and delivery of individually tailored care plans, developed in consultation with the person, their family carers and a range of health and social care practitioners. The key worker will also provide expert knowledge and leadership in dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured funding through the 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to continue funding in 2019 for the Dementia Community Activation Coordinator post which has been co-funded through a partnership between the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the HSE during 2018. The Community Activation Coordinator is working with national organisations and key community stakeholders to support community dementia champions across Ireland. The Coordinator will seek to grow the number of champions and people within communities to take action to create sustainable dementia inclusive communities.</p>  <p>  In terms of the specific requests for funding set out in the ASI pre-budget submission, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year. The Strategy emphasises the need for a "whole community response" to dementia, as the majority of people with dementia live in their own communities and wish to avail of services in their local area.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. The project showed that the average number of community-based services in each Community Health Organisation was 35. Services provided in the community include dementia day care centres, a large proportion of which operate five days a week; dementia-specific homecare delivered by fully trained staff who are familiar with and understand the different symptoms and stages of dementia; dementia-friendly activities such as choirs and art gallery visits; dementia social clubs and Alzheimer Caf&eacute;s; carer support groups; and dementia advisers. These services are provided by voluntary organisations and the HSE and partner organisations. </p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  In addition to these community supports, in 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages (Dementia-IHCPs) to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home. These were initially co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies and now fully funded by the HSE, which has committed to continue to provide approximately 120 packages at any one time. In addition to the IHCPs, people with dementia are also able to avail of standard home care services on the basis of need and within the resources available</p>  <p>  The Department of Health secured &euro;6.26 million through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a national dementia registry; the national rollout of a Dementia Training Programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of Dementia Resource Centres; funding for a dementia community activation coordinator; and community support projects for people with dementia. </p>  <p>  In terms of plans to expand support levels for people with dementia, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning. </p>  <p>In July, I met with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and discussed dementia issues, and have offered to meet with them again soon. I have also met Senator Colette Kelleher, a former CEO and advocate of the ASI, to specifically discuss the needs of people with dementia. I remain willing to engage with advocacy groups on dementia issues, and am committed to maintaining the warm relationships the Department has with them as we continue to work towards the greater provision of services and care to people with dementia, their carers and families.</p></reply>

The Act also provides the necessary safeguards to protect the rights of such patients, as admissions on this basis proceed regardless of whether the patient consents to admission or not.</p>  <p>  The process of involuntary detention under the Mental Health Act is a three-step process.  The first step requires an applicant who has concerns about the mental health and welfare of the person to make an application for the person to be involuntarily admitted.  </p>  <p>  The second step requires that the person be examined and reviewed by a General Practitioner. Where the General Practitioner is of the view that the person is suffering from a mental disorder and would benefit from a period of treatment in hospital, or if there is a risk of harm by that person to themselves or others, he/she would then make a recommendation that the person concerned be involuntarily admitted to hospital.</p>  <p>  The third step requires a consultant psychiatrist on duty to examine and review the person who is the subject of the application. If the psychiatrist, following an assessment agrees that clinically the person satisfies the criteria for detention and requires an in-patient admission under the Act, he/she will sign an admission order.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that an application for an involuntary admission is ultimately a clinical decision as to whether the individual meets the criteria for detention.  Therefore, as the Deputy's question relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply as a matter of urgency to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Reducing waiting times for hospital procedures is a key priority of this Government. </p>  <p>  The latest NTPF figures show that 61% of patients on the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group (CHG) Outpatient Waiting list are waiting 12 months or less and 69% of patients are waiting 15 months or less.</p>  <p>  The CHG advises that there has been a major investment in additional consultant posts this year to reduce waiting times including orthopaedics and cardiology.  As part of the national model of care for children an additional 12 Consultant posts are being recruited in three specialities, namely General Paediatrics (4 posts), Paediatric Emergency Medicine (6 posts) and Paediatric Radiology (2 posts).  These consultant posts will join the cross-city department/s of Paediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM), General Paediatrics and Paediatric Radiology to support the delivery of care at the existing children&rsquo;s hospitals; Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group, Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Tallaght University Hospital and at the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly upon opening in 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition, the planned new national children&rsquo;s hospital will in time expand the physical capacity needed to increase activity and reduce waiting times in all paediatric services to help tackle current and future challenges in child health.</p>  <p>  The CHG advises that the challenge for the children&rsquo;s hospitals is the volume of patients referred to the three hospitals and the Consultant capacity to deliver the service.  The children&rsquo;s hospital have and continue to work with specialists to reduce waiting lists.  The National Model of Care aims to deliver a hub and spoke model of care by providing treatment as near to the child&rsquo;s home as possible depending on their clinical needs.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I approved the establishment of a Central Waiting List Validation function in the NTPF. The new office will consolidate and centralise validation activity for all Inpatient / Daycase and Outpatient waiting lists, thus ensuring a standardisation of approach across all waiting lists and all hospitals. </p></reply>

It is expected that an appointment will be announced by year end.</p>  <p>  The PAS has concluded the process for recruitment of a Chairperson of the Board of the Health Service Executive and has sent its report to me.  A decision on the successful candidate is imminent. A PAS campaign to identify 8 ordinary members of the Board, one of whom will be nominated as Deputy Chairperson, will commence in the coming weeks.  This campaign will seek to identify persons with the appropriate skills and expertise to support the Chairperson in giving strong leadership to the HSE in delivering safe effective health and social care services and in guiding the HSE through a challenging programme of change. </p></reply>

It sets out four overarching goals and ten high-level strategic actions which will be the key focus for the first three years of the reform programme.</p>  <p>  Key actions in the first three years of reform in primary/community care include the development of a plan for the organisation and operation of community-based services based on population need and size.  At this stage, it is not possible to definitively calculate the cost of universal primary care given the wide range of services, including nursing, multiple therapies, homecare packages and many others which are encompassed under primary care services.  Such a calculation would require a complex and detailed modelling exercise to account for a range of demographic changes and future projections of service demands.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  It should be noted that in certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p></reply>

This means that the referendum result remains provisional and the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 cannot be signed into law by the President.  Therefore, the Bill to expand the grounds for the legal termination of pregnancy cannot be published in the Houses of the Oireachtas, as article 40.3.3 remains unchanged in the Constitution. </p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy will also be aware, the General Scheme of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 was published in advance of the Referendum on the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution, and an Updated General Scheme was approved by Government on 10 July 2018 and published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  Head 6 of the Updated General Scheme makes provision for access to termination on the grounds of a condition affecting the foetus that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to bring the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill to Government as soon as possible.  It is a priority for the Government to have a medically delivered, safe and regulated service for the termination of pregnancy for all those who require it in this State.</p></reply>

The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised.</p>  <p>  Currently, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period.  This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020.  In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups.  Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  </p>  <p>  To date in 2018, &euro;2.8 million approximately has been paid to just over 20,000 sheep farmers from the sheep welfare scheme.  I also recently announced a doubling of the financial support to sheep farmers of support payments for compliance with new sheep EID rules of &euro;100 per farmer. </p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector.  National Farm Survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler and sheep farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p>  <p>  As I outlined to the Joint Oireachtas Committee this week, I have also put in place a range of initiatives and supports aimed at reducing pressure on farmers in response to the current fodder shortages. </p></reply>

The RDP is co-funded by the EU&rsquo;s European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to a sum of &euro;2.19 billion over the programme lifespan.  This EU funding is supplemented by Exchequer funding bringing the total allocation to &euro;4 billion.</p><p>The latest review of the RDP confirmed that entire budget of some &euro;4 billion is fully committed and is expected to be spent by the end of 2020, although there will be some carry-over into 2021.  Under EU regulations governing the Rural Development Programme, funds for multi-annual commitments entered into by the end of 2020 may be claimed up to the end of 2023.  The Review of Expenditure under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020 completed in June 2018 has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website and is available at the following link <i><font color="#2F2F2F"></font></i><i><font color="#2F2F2F">.</font></i></p><p>With regard to funding for the Areas facing Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme, the financial allocation for 2018 is &euro;227 million, which includes &euro;25 million in additional funding on foot of the Programme for Partnership Government commitment to increase ANC funding.  Based on current projections, the projected total spend is expected to be almost &euro;1.5 billion for ANC and the transitional schemes LFA/DAS over the duration of the RDP.  The projected spend for GLAS and the transitional agri-environment measures is &euro;1.4 billion over the duration of the RDP.  As the RDP funding is fully committed and expected to be spent. </p><p>The &euro;4 billion investment under the Rural Development Programme represents a substantial vote of confidence in Irish farming and in rural Ireland.  My Department will continue to review the implementation of the Rural Development Programme to ensure that the RDP funding is fully spent and thereby providing a vital support to our farming community and rural Ireland.  My Department will also ensure that all EU funding is fully drawn down and that all targets set down under the Rural Development Programme are met.</p><p>In relation to low cost loans, I announced in Budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses.  These schemes are developed and delivered in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and take time to develop and operationalise.  Consideration and discussions are ongoing in this regard and I will announce further details on this as they become available.</p></reply>

Following the fodder difficulties of last winter and spring I formed a representative group chaired by Teagasc, including stakeholders such as co-ops, banks, farm bodies, among others, to co-ordinate advisory messages to farmers this summer around replenishing depleted stocks of fodder.  I have requested the group to co-ordinate advice on managing grazing and fodder conservation through this extended period of extraordinarily dry weather.  Practical advice is being shared across the group on dealing both with the current weather and on filling the significant fodder gap.</p><p>On the 26<sup>th</sup>June last, I launched a national fodder survey to be compiled by Teagasc through its client network as well as clients of the other fodder group stakeholders, with another survey being conducted this week.  Given the findings of this survey, the overall priority must be to conserve as much fodder for the coming winter as possible when the opportunity to do so arises. </p><p>I met with Commissioner Hogan on the 24<sup>th</sup>July last and briefed him on the impact on Irish Agriculture of the dry spell.  I secured agreement from the Commissioner to pay higher advance payments this autumn.  As a result, advances for Pillar 1 and 2 payments will be increased to 70% and 85%, respectively, resulting in &euro;260 million in additional cashflow for farmers at a vital time of the year.  I also proposed to Commissioner Hogan certain flexibilities for participants under the GLAS scheme which will replenish their fodder stocks for the winter period.  In this connection I am pleased to have secured the agreement of the European Commission for these measures, which are now in place since 1<sup>st</sup>September and which together bring a potential additional 270,000 hectares into fodder production. </p><p>Furthermore on the 3<sup>rd</sup>August I announced a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market. This measure will provide an incentive of &euro;155 per hectare for tillage growers who grow a temporary crop of short rotation grasses for fodder production over the winter months and &euro;100 per hectare for those growing catch crops such as fodder rape, turnips and brassica crops.  Currently over 23,000 hectares of catch crops are supported under the Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS.  This additional funding commitment aims to incentivise a doubling of this area.<i></i>I am confident this measure will support Tillage farmers to supply into the market for fodder.  Tillage farmers are a critical part of our agricultural sector, supplying the brewing and distilling industry, grain to the feed industry and straw to the livestock sector, while also delivering other benefits. </p><p>Also, following consultation in August with my Government colleague, the Minister for Planning, Housing and Local Government, Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., flexibility has been granted on an extension to the closed period for spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers in order to capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production.  This extra two weeks granted by Minister Murphy will allow application up to the 30<sup>th</sup>September and 31<sup>st</sup>October, respectively, and again maximise the opportunity for autumn production. </p><p>On the 22<sup>nd</sup>August I announced a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018.  The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage, that is: hay, silage, haylage, alfalfa and others from outside the island of Ireland.  The measure will operate through the co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12<sup>th</sup>August 2018 to 31<sup>st</sup>December 2018 and will of course be subject to EU State Aid (<i>de-minimis</i>) rules.  I wish to confirm that while the measure will operate through the co-operatives/registered importers, the actual beneficiaries will be farmers who need supplies of fodder. </p><p>I know that the range of measures introduced by me to date taken together and targeted at producing as much fodder as possible from our own land provide the most effective response to a fodder shortfall.  I can also assure you that I will continue to closely monitor and engage on this significant challenge during this difficult period.</p></reply>

I have requested the group to co-ordinate advice on managing grazing and fodder conservation through this extended period of extraordinarily dry weather.  </p><p>On the 26<sup>th</sup>June last I launched a national fodder survey to be compiled by Teagasc through its client network as well as clients of the other fodder group stakeholders, with another survey currently being undertaken with interim results expected to be available next week.</p><p>I met with Commissioner Hogan on the 24<sup>th</sup>July last and briefed him on the impact on Irish Agriculture of the dry spell.  I have secured agreement from the Commissioner to pay higher advance payments this autumn. As a result, advances for Pillar 1 and 2 payments will be increased to 70% and 85% respectively, resulting in &euro;260 million in additional cash flow for farmers at a vital time of the year.  I proposed to Commissioner Hogan certain flexibilities for participants under the GLAS scheme which will replenish their fodder stocks for the winter period. </p><p>I am very pleased to have secured the agreement of the European Commission for these flexibilities which are now in place since 1<sup>st</sup>September and which together bring a potential additional 270,000 hectares into fodder production. </p><p>Furthermore on the 3<sup>rd</sup>August I announced a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market. This measure will provide an incentive of &euro;155 per hectare for tillage growers who grow a temporary crop of short rotation grasses for fodder production over the winter months and &euro;100 per hectare for those growing catch crops such as fodder Rape, Turnips and Brassica crops.  Currently over 23,000 hectares of catch crops are supported under the Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS. This additional funding commitment aims to incentivise a doubling of this area.  I am confident this measure will support Tillage farmers to supply into the market for fodder.  Tillage farmers are a critical part of our agricultural sector, supplying the brewing and distilling industry, grain to the feed industry and straw to the livestock sector, whilst also delivering other benefits. </p><p>Also, following consultation in August with my Government colleague the Minister for Planning, Housing and Local Government Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., flexibility has been granted on an extension to the closed period for spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers in order to capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production. This extra two weeks granted by Minister Murphy will allow application up to the 30<sup>th</sup>September and 31<sup>st</sup>October respectively and again maximise the opportunity for Autumn production. </p><p>On the 22<sup>nd</sup>August I announced a &euro;4.25million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage, that is: hay silage, haylage, alfalfa and others from outside the island of Ireland. The measure will operate through the Co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12<sup>th</sup>August 2018 to 31<sup>st</sup>December 2018 and will of course be subject to EU State Aid (<i>de-minimis</i>) rules.I wish to confirm that while the measure will operate through the Co-operatives/registered importers, the actual beneficiaries will be farmers who need supplies of fodder. </p><p>I know that the range of measures introduced by me to-date taken together and targeted at producing as much fodder as possible from our own land provide the most effective response to a fodder shortfall. I can assure you that I will continue to closely monitor and engage on this significant challenge during this difficult period.</p></reply>

The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised.</p>  <p>  Currently, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmer also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  </p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. National Farm Survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post 2020. In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP. My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p></reply>

Following the fodder difficulties of last Winter and Spring I formed a representative group chaired by Teagasc, including stakeholders such as Co-ops, banks, farm bodies, amongst others, to coordinate advisory messages to farmers this Summer around replenishing depleted stocks of fodder. I have requested the group to co-ordinate advice on managing grazing and fodder conservation through this extended period of extraordinarily dry weather. Practical advice is being shared across the group on dealing both with the current weather and on filling the significant fodder gap.</p><p>On the 26<sup>th</sup>June last, I launched a national fodder survey to be compiled by Teagasc through its client network as well as clients of the other fodder group stakeholders, with another survey being conducted this week. Given the findings of this survey, the overall priority must be to conserve as much fodder for the coming winter as possible when the opportunity to do so arises. </p><p>I met with Commissioner Hogan on the 24<sup>th</sup>July last and briefed him on the impact on Irish Agriculture of the dry spell.  I secured agreement from the Commissioner to pay higher advance payments this autumn. As a result, advances for Pillar 1 and 2 payments will be increased to 70% and 85% respectively, resulting in &euro;260 million in additional cash flow for farmers at a vital time of the year. I also proposed to Commissioner Hogan certain flexibilities for participants under the GLAS scheme which will replenish their fodder stocks for the winter period. In this connection I am pleased to have secured the agreement of the European Commission for these measures which, are now in place since 1<sup>st</sup>September and which together bring a potential additional 270,000 hectares into fodder production. </p><p>Furthermore on the 3<sup>rd</sup>August I announced a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market. This measure will provide an incentive of &euro;155 per hectare for tillage growers who grow a temporary crop of short rotation grasses for fodder production over the winter months and &euro;100 per hectare for those growing catch crops such as fodder Rape, Turnips and Brassica crops.  Currently over 23,000 hectares of catch crops are supported under the Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS. This additional funding commitment aims to incentivise a doubling of this area.<i></i>I am confident this measure will support Tillage farmers to supply into the market for fodder.  Tillage farmers are a critical part of our agricultural sector ,supplying the brewing and distilling industry, grain to the feed industry and straw to the livestock sector, whilst also delivering other benefits. </p><p>Also, following consultation in August with my Government colleague the Minister for Planning, Housing and Local Government Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., flexibility has been granted on an extension to the closed period for spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers in order to capitalise on Autumn grass growth for fodder production. This extra two weeks granted by Minister Murphy will allow application up to the 30<sup>th</sup>September and 31<sup>st</sup>October respectively and again maximise the opportunity for Autumn production. </p><p>On the 22<sup>nd</sup>August I announced a &euro;4.25million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage ,that is: hay, silage, haylage, alfalfa and others from outside the island of Ireland. The measure will operate through the Co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12<sup>th</sup>August 2018 to 31<sup>st</sup>December 2018 and will of course be subject to EU State Aid (<i>de-minimis</i>) rules.I wish to confirm that while the measure will operate through the Co-operatives/registered importers, the actual beneficiaries will be farmers who need supplies of fodder. </p><p>I know that the range of measures introduced by me to-date taken together and targeted at producing as much fodder as possible from our own land provide the most effective response to a fodder shortfall.  I can also assure you that I will continue to closely monitor and engage on this significant challenge during this difficult period.</p></reply>

While the figures for 2017 are not yet published, I am in a position to attach the, as yet unconfirmed, figures for 2017 &ndash; table 3 - on the basis that they are subject to finalisation in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Numbers are not yet available in respect of 2018 as these are normally prepared towards the end of each year in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </p><p>Samples from culled badgers are not routinely cultured for TB, as previous studies have shown that the levels of TB in badgers is high when the TB prevalence in cattle locally is high. Similarly, when local bovine TB levels are lower, the levels of TB in badgers is lower.  Tissues from badgers are tested for TB when required for specific studies, and the details of such tests carried out by my Department&rsquo;s Regional Veterinary Laboratories and the Irish Diagnostic Laboratory Services are provided in tables 4 and 5 below. </p><p>The Deputy should be aware that under current operating protocols, where herds are identified with a serious outbreak of bovine tuberculosis, and where my Department&rsquo;s epidemiological investigations into the cause of the breakdown implicates badgers as a possible source, a capturing program is set up in the local area. The aims of the program are to manage the local population of badgers downward to an average level of 0.5 badgers per Km<sup>2</sup>which is the optimal density that mitigates badger to cattle transmission.An annual culling effort is managed to ensure these lower density levels are maintained.  The long-term culling of badgers is not ideal or sustainable.  They are protected by national legislation and are listed within the Berne Convention.  Therefore, they are captured under a licence granted to my Department by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  </p><p>Field trials testing the effectiveness of badger vaccination as an alternative to removal confirmed that vaccination of badgers can play a role in reducing the level of infection in cattle.  From January 2018 the formal vaccination programme commenced in the areas which formed part of the field trials, i.e. in parts of counties Monaghan, Longford, Galway, Tipperary, Waterford, Kilkenny, Cork and in all of Louth.  Badgers in a vaccination area will be captured/vaccinated/released instead of being captured/culled.  The vaccination program will continue on an annual basis, so each year&rsquo;s births in vaccination areas will be vaccinated as they are captured.  The vaccination area will be expanded incrementally to all parts of the country during the 2018-2022 period and it is anticipated that the rate of badger removal will reduce over that period. In areas with severe TB outbreaks epidemiologically linked to badgers, some level of badger removals may still continue to be necessary, but the overall level of removals  is likely to be significantly reduced. </p><p><b>Table 1 -

The Conclusion Statement will be finalised taking account, if appropriate, of any written submissions or observations made to my Department during the public and statutory consultation phase for aquaculture applications as they relate to the conservation features in the West of Ardara/Maas Road SAC, and any other relevant information.  The statutory and public consultation phase for aquaculture applications in this SAC has not yet been completed.</p><p>My Department is continuing to examine aquaculture applications in the West of Ardara/Maas Road SAC in accordance with the applicable legislation and full account is being taken of the engineering, scientific, environmental, legal and public policy aspects relevant to each application. Aquaculture projects in this SAC will only be authorized if they (individually or in combination with other plans or projects) do not give rise to significant adverse impacts on the integrity of West of Ardara / Maas Road SAC, having regard to its Conservation Objectives.</p><p>As the aquaculture licence applications in this SAC under active consideration as part of a statutory process it would not be appropriate to comment further on the matter at this time.</p></reply>

The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised.</p>  <p>  Currently, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmer also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. National Farm Survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post 2020. In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP. My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p></reply>

With the challenging weather conditions experienced by farmers this year, I am keenly aware of the importance of these supports for farmers, and accordingly the issuing of payments under these schemes is a matter of priority for my Department.</p>  <p>  The main schemes are delivered under the framework of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, and each year approximately &euro;1.5bn issues under these schemes.  My Department has a strong record in the efficient delivery of these payments, as evidenced by the fact that we perform very favourably compared to other EU Member States in terms of both the dates on which payments are delivered and our ability to maximise the drawdown of available EU funding.</p>  <p>  In terms of the individual schemes, The Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme is due to commence payment on schedule again this year.  In 2017, in the week beginning 18th September, payments in excess of &euro;160 million issued to over 75,000 farmers.  This represented a significant increase over the 65,000 paid at the same stage in 2016.</p>  <p>  The main Direct Payment scheme is the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).  Advance payments are due to commence on 16 October this year, which is the first date permissible under the EU Regulations.  In light of the challenging conditions experienced in 2018, agreement has been reached that the advance payment rate will be set at 70% for 2018, rather than the 50% provided for in EU regulations.  </p>  <p>  Following the first payments issuing on 16th October, regular payment runs will be made in respect of all applicants whose applications are fully processed and who have no outstanding errors.  The balancing payment, at a rate of 30%, will begin to issue to farmers at the beginning of December.</p>  <p>  For the 2017 BPS advance payment, 111,000 farmers received an advance payment totalling some &euro;700 million on the first pay run, representing an increase from the 109,000 farmers paid at the same stage in 2016.</p>  <p>  2017 GLAS advance payments commenced in November 2017. To date 99.7% of eligible advances have been paid. GLAS balance payments commenced on schedule in May 2018. To date 99% of eligible cases have been paid. The bulk of outstanding payments are due to the non submission of Commonage Management Plans (CMPs), Nutrient Management Plans (NMPS) and non participation in GLAS training. 2018 advance payments are on track to commence in November and will be paid at the higher rate of 85%. GLAS payments continue to issue on a weekly basis.</p>  <p>  To assist farmers in replenishing their fodder stocks, flexibilities have been introduced in the GLAS scheme for the LIPP and EMFL actions. LIPP parcels can be cut for the production of hay or silage from 1 September to 30 November 30. In addition off takes can be removed from GLAS fallow land parcels for the production of fodder during the same period. These derogations will apply for 2018 only. Standard scheme specification apply from 1 December 2018 onwards.</p></reply>

Illegal dumping is one of the unauthorised activities encompassed by those Bye-Laws.</p>  <p>  The matter was raised with Coillte who advise that, due to the extent and location of the Coillte estate, illegal dumping is a significant issue for the company.  The company advise that it has six Business Area Units across the country, each with a specific function in relation to the management of broad estate issues like dumping. </p>  <p>  I understand that the company&rsquo;s Midlands Business Area Unit, which covers almost ten counties including Cavan and Monaghan, will spend approximately &euro;20,000 on waste disposal associated with illegal dumping this year. Coillte advise that this is double the expected amount indicating a higher level of dumping activity in general. </p>  <p>  Coillte advise that it is committed to ensuring that visitors can enjoy visiting its forest parks and trails without the sight of illegally dumped rubbish. The company adds that, to deter illegal dumping, it installs signs, barriers and CCTV at illegal dumping hotspots. I am advised that Coillte is currently trialling a &lsquo;Confidential Line&rsquo; which will be displayed on the company website and signage, with information gathered to be filtered back to staff either through e-mail or by phone on more urgent items. Coillte advise that it actively investigates all reports of dumping and, where evidence is found of those responsible, it is passed on to local authority Litter Wardens who are responsible for issuing fines and pursuing prosecutions. The company add that it has good working relations with all Local Authorities to manage and remove dumped material.</p></reply>

It is important that we learn some of the lessons from this Spring and Summer and build resilience into our systems going forward.</p>  <p>  As the most recent weather events have shown, farmers should have access to measures that improve their capacity to respond to these occurrences.

Following the fodder difficulties of last Winter and Spring I formed a representative group chaired by Teagasc, including stakeholders such as Co-ops, banks, farm bodies, amongst others, to coordinate advisory messages to farmers this Summer around replenishing depleted stocks of fodder. I have requested the group to co-ordinate advice on managing grazing and fodder conservation through this extended period of extraordinarily dry weather. Practical advice is being shared across the group on dealing both with the current weather and on filling the significant fodder gap.</p><p>On 26 June last, I launched a national fodder survey to be compiled by Teagasc through its client network as well as clients of the other fodder group stakeholders, with another survey being conducted this week. Given the findings of this survey, the overall priority must be to conserve as much fodder for the coming winter as possible when the opportunity to do so arises.</p><p>I met with Commissioner Hogan on 24 July last and briefed him on the impact on Irish Agriculture of the dry spell.  I secured agreement from the Commissioner to pay higher advance payments this Autumn. As a result, advances for Pillar 1 and 2 payments will be increased to 70% and 85% respectively, resulting in &euro;260 million in additional cash flow for farmers at a vital time of the year. I also proposed to Commissioner Hogan certain flexibilities for participants under the GLAS scheme which will replenish their fodder stocks for the winter period. In this connection I am pleased to have secured the agreement of the European Commission for these measures which are now in place since 1 September and which together bring a potential additional 270,000 hectares into fodder production.</p><p>Furthermore on 3 August I announced a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market. This measure will provide an incentive of &euro;155 per hectare for tillage growers who grow a temporary crop of short rotation grasses for fodder production over the winter months and &euro;100 per hectare for those growing catch crops such as fodder Rape, Turnips and Brassica crops.  Currently over 23,000 hectares of catch crops are supported under the Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS. This additional funding commitment aims to incentivise a doubling of this area.<i></i>I am confident<i></i>this measure will support Tillage farmers to supply into the market for fodder.  Tillage farmers are a critical part of our agricultural sector, supplying the brewing and distilling industry, grain to the feed industry and straw to the livestock sector, whilst also delivering other benefits.</p><p>Also, following consultation in August with my Government colleague the Minister for Planning, Housing and Local Government Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D. flexibility has been granted on an extension to the closed period for spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers  in order to capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production. This extra two weeks granted by Minister Murphy will allow application up to 30 September and 31 October respectively and again maximise the opportunity for Autumn production.</p><p>On 22 August I announced a &euro;4.25million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage, that is: hay, silage, haylage, alfalfa and others from outside the island of Ireland. The measure will operate through the Co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12 August 2018 to 31 December 2018 and will of course be subject to EU State Aid (<i>de-minimis</i>) rules.  I wish to confirm that while the measure will operate through the Co-operatives/registered importers, the actual beneficiaries will be farmers who need supplies of fodder. </p><p>I know that the range of measures introduced by me to-date taken together and targeted at producing as much fodder as possible from our own land provide the most effective response to a fodder shortfall.  I can also assure you that I will continue to closely monitor and engage on this significant challenge during this difficult period.</p></reply>

I announced in Budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses. These schemes are developed and delivered in cooperation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and take time to develop and operationalise. Consideration and discussions with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Finance are ongoing on a long-term investment scheme and an announcement in this regard is expected to be made shortly.</p>  <p>  While continuing to explore additional funding mechanisms to address gaps in the market, I also liaise with the main banks on access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have had ongoing engagement with the banks on the cash flow pressures arising from the effects of the weather on grazing and fodder stocks and I welcome that they are following through on their commitment to support the sector. The delivery of last year&rsquo;s Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Scheme is acting as a catalyst to encourage financial institutions to improve and develop new loan products for the sector. A recently announced initiative by one of the main banks mirrors the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme in offering a discounted interest rate with extended and flexible repayment terms. The &lsquo;Milk Flex&rsquo; loan product developed by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, with dairy co-op and private banking participation, is another good example of innovation in this regard.</p>  <p>  I know that many farmers will be relying heavily on co-op and merchant credit to navigate through the current situation. Therefore, I have also welcomed recent initiatives by co-ops in relation to credit facilities for their suppliers.</p></reply>

Following the fodder difficulties of last Winter and Spring I formed a representative group chaired by Teagasc, including stakeholders such as Co-ops, banks, farm bodies, among others, to coordinate advisory messages to farmers this Summer around replenishing depleted stocks of fodder. I have requested the group to co-ordinate advice on managing grazing and fodder conservation through this extended period of extraordinarily dry weather. Practical advice is being shared across the group on dealing both with the current weather and on filling the significant fodder gap.</p><p>On the 26<sup>th</sup>June last, I launched a national fodder survey to be compiled by Teagasc through its client network as well as clients of the other fodder group stakeholders, with another survey being conducted this week. Given the findings of this survey, the overall priority must be to conserve as much fodder for the coming Winter as possible when the opportunity to do so arises. </p><p>I met with Commissioner Hogan on the 24<sup>th</sup>July last and briefed him on the impact on Irish Agriculture of the dry spell.  I secured agreement from the Commissioner to pay higher advance payments this autumn. As a result, advances for Pillar 1 and 2 payments will be increased to 70% and 85% respectively, resulting in &euro;260 million in additional cash flow for farmers at a vital time of the year. I also proposed to Commissioner Hogan certain flexibilities for participants under the GLAS scheme which will replenish their fodder stocks for the winter period. In this connection I am pleased to have secured the agreement of the European Commission for these measures which, are now in place since 1<sup>st</sup>September and which together bring a potential additional 270,000 hectares into fodder production. </p><p>Furthermore on the 3<sup>rd</sup>August I announced a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market. This measure will provide an incentive of &euro;155 per hectare for tillage growers who grow a temporary crop of short rotation grasses for fodder production over the winter months and &euro;100 per hectare for those growing catch crops such as fodder Rape, Turnips and Brassica crops.  Currently over 23,000 hectares of catch crops are supported under the Agri-Environment Scheme, GLAS. This additional funding commitment aims to incentivise a doubling of this area.<i></i>I am confident<i></i>this measure will support Tillage farmers to supply into the market for fodder.  Tillage farmers are a critical part of our agricultural sector, supplying the brewing and distilling industry, grain to the feed industry and straw to the livestock sector, whilst also delivering other benefits. </p><p>Also, following consultation in August with my Government colleague, the Minister for Planning, Housing and Local Government, Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., flexibility has been granted on an extension to the closed period for spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers in order to capitalise on Autumn grass growth for fodder production. This extra two weeks granted by Minister Murphy will allow application up to the 30<sup>th</sup>September  and 31<sup>st</sup>October respectively and again maximise the opportunity for Autumn production. </p><p>On the 22<sup>nd</sup>August I announced a &euro;4.25million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage, that is: hay, silage, haylage, alfalfa and others from outside the island of Ireland. The measure will operate through the Co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12<sup>th</sup>August 2018 to 31<sup>st</sup>December 2018 and will of course be subject to EU State Aid (<i>de-minimis</i>) rules.  I wish to confirm that while the measure will operate through the Co-operatives/registered importers, the actual beneficiaries will be farmers who need supplies of fodder. </p><p>I know that the range of measures introduced by me to-date taken together and targeted at producing as much fodder as possible from our own land provide the most effective response to a fodder shortfall.

I announced in Budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers, fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses. These schemes are developed and delivered in cooperation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and take time to develop and operationalise. Consideration and discussions with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Finance are ongoing on a long-term investment scheme and an announcement in this regard is expected to be made shortly.</p>  <p>  While continuing to explore additional funding mechanisms to address gaps in the market, I also liaise with the main banks on access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector. I have had ongoing engagement with the banks on the cash flow pressures arising from the effects of the weather on grazing and fodder stocks and I welcome that they are following through on their commitment to support the sector.  The delivery of last year&rsquo;s Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Scheme is acting as a catalyst to encourage financial institutions to improve and develop new loan products for the sector.  A recently announced initiative by one of the main banks mirrors the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme in offering a discounted interest rate with extended and flexible repayment terms. The &lsquo;Milk Flex&rsquo; loan product developed by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, with dairy co-op and private banking participation, is another good example of innovation in this regard.</p>  <p>  I know that many farmers will be relying heavily on co-op and merchant credit to navigate through the current situation. Therefore, I have also welcomed recent initiatives by co-ops in relation to credit facilities for their suppliers.</p></reply>

Thanks to the efforts of all stakeholders, bovine TB levels have reduced significantly in recent years. Herd incidence stood at 8% in 2000 and was under 3.5% in 2017. This represents considerable progress. In the absence of a robust TB eradication Scheme, many more farmers would have suffered a TB breakdown. When a breakdown occurs, certain controls are put in place in an effort to eradicate the disease from that holding and to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading to other holdings. These controls are critical and are to the overall benefit of farmers. While much progress has been made in reducing bovine TB levels, I am concerned that previously observed downward trends in disease levels may have stalled. In an effort to deliver on my stated objective of eradicating bovine TB by 2030, government has approved the establishment of a TB Stakeholder Forum with an independent Chair who have been tasked with bringing forward proposals consistent with eradicating TB by 2030. I look forward to considering these proposals in due course.</p>  <p>  In relation to compensation, a comprehensive regime is in place for herdowners who are affected by bovine TB, including compensation both for direct and indirect losses. </p>  <p>  The primary compensation scheme for TB Affected herds is the On-Farm Market Valuation (OFMV) Scheme under which compensation is payable for cattle removed as reactors on thebasis of the open market value, subject to certain ceiling limits.

I was very pleased to recently add forestry to the sectors available for KT groups. Peer-to-peer learning is a key element of these groups and is a proven success.  </p><p>KTGs involve groups of up to 20 forest owners, who meet at seven meetings or events.  Events can include outdoor activities, such as visits to forests or sawmills, with a maximum of two events per group.  KT facilitators, holding at a minimum a NFQ Level 8 qualification, liaise with KTG organisers, manage the learning events, select from various optional subjects and cover mandatory topics. </p><p>Applications are now open to KTG organisers to submit proposals to my Department, outlining the structure of the programme they are offering.  Following the closing date on 14<sup>th</sup>September, those applications will be evaluated according to the scheme terms and conditions.  Successful groups will then be invited to submit a Form 1 application, which seeks approval by the KTG organiser to establish a group.  Those KTG organisers that are approved to establish a group will then seek forest owner participants.</p><p>The funding structure, following successful completion of the KTG&rsquo;s programme of meetings and events is:</p><p>- &euro;70 per event, providing a minimum of four events have been attended to a maximum of seven, payable to each participant.

The main driver of export growth was Irish Organic Salmon increasing in value by 69% from &euro;71 to &euro;121 million.  Other export products such as seaweed, shrimp, prawn and whiting also experienced strong growth.  France is the most important market for exports accounting for over one quarter of the total value.  The UK and Spain are the other top export partners both accounting for over 10% of total export value.</p>  <p>  To assist our seafood processing sector in achieving its growth potential in the years ahead, and informed by Food Wise 2025, the Government is focussed on encouraging the sector to add value to fish raw material through increased innovation and development of new consumer products, encouraging the sector to further enhance its scale to make it more competitive on world markets, and encouraging the development and diversification of our export markets.

The RESS has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction based, cost effective framework. The RESS will deliver a broader range of policy objectives including: the provision of pathways and supports for communities to participate in renewable energy projects; broadening the renewable electricity technology mix and increasing energy security, energy sustainability and ensuring the cost effectiveness of energy policy.</p>  <p>  Key to the success of RESS will be the development of an enabling framework for community participation and this will be crucial to drive broader participation in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a more decentralised and decarbonised electricity system.</p>  <p>  Within this framework, there will be opportunities for farming communities to participate in the community-led category of RESS. Furthermore there will be obligations on developer-led projects to offer mandatory investment opportunities to those living in proximity to these project looking for support under the RESS. My Department will engage further with all relevant stakeholders over the coming months on the detailed design of these community measures.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in July I launched a pilot support scheme for micro generation, targeting domestic customers and solar PV, with an emphasis on self-consumption and battery storage. Farm homes will be able to avail of this grant support to install solar PV panels on their roofs, thereby reducing their energy costs. The scheme will be subject to a six month review which will explore opportunities for broadening the scheme to include other technologies and to support other groups of users.</p>  <p>  In addition to these opportunities, there are a number of other supports available to farmers under various schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine,  including supports for solar PV for electricity production under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme (PPIS) as part of  the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes and supports for renewable heat technologies in the form of biomass boilers under the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme (YFCIS). In addition, air-source heat pumps are currently supported under the PPIS and YFCIS schemes and they may be used as part of a water heater under the Dairy Equipment Scheme.</p>  <p>  Complimentary programmes like these delivered across a number of Government Departments are crucial in delivering our climate and energy ambitions as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040. The Deputy will also appreciate that in developing and expanding renewable energy support schemes  that a careful balance must be struck between the subsidy to  renewable generators, whether they be large or small, and the additional costs to pay for these schemes that are transferred to  electricity bill payers. Proposals for all such schemes are and must be subject to careful economic appraisal.</p></reply>

This process has unfortunately taken longer than envisaged, due to data protection issues that have arisen since the introduction of GDPR.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to introducing the annual support as soon as practically possible in conjunction with relevant agencies and stakeholders.</p><p>In line with the commitments set out in <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland,</i>published in 2012, and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention and greater recycling, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection are being phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers contracts come up for renewal. The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure. </p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or a weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced.  Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p><p>The Price Monitoring Group has considered eleven months of data to date.  While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability. </p></reply>

This Bill, the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017, has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Online Safety was launched by the Taoiseach on 11 July and contains 25 actions to be implemented by the six sponsor Departments over the next 12-18 months.  These actions cover a range of activities relevant to the proposed Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner, including education and awareness raising, communicating with the public, and oversight and consultative structures.  Action 18 of the plan commits the Government to working with the Joint Oireachtas Committee in relation to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's Bill. </p>  <p>  The Bill raises jurisdictional and legal issues which will impact on the mandate, structure and costs of  the proposed Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner.  In advance of these issues being determined by the Oireachtas, it would not be feasible to set out costings.  However, the Government will work with the Committee as it considers these matters in the context of its post Second Stage scrutiny.</p></reply>

ESB is working with a number of wave energy project developers to realise this 5MW project. </p>  <p>  Since 2003, the project has received exchequer funding of almost &euro;780,000 including funding provided since 2009 from the Prototype Development Fund. This main focus of the Prototype Development Fund is to stimulate the development and deployment of ocean energy devices and systems. This funding has supported the overall objective of the WestWave project to demonstrate that wave energy projects can be designed, consented, developed and operated in Ireland, ultimately producing electricity to the grid. The WestWave project has established a site for a generic pre-commercial wave project off the west coast of Ireland, in Killard, Co. Clare.</p>  <p>  Wave and tidal energy is still at the research, development and demonstration stage globally, and while promising experimental devices have been developed, much more research is required to bring wave energy technology to commercial viability. Consequently it has not yet been possible to confirm a date for a final investment decision or operation. I am advised that the earliest date for operation based on the current view of technology is 2025. ESB is investigating various sources of funding such as those provided by the European Investment Bank. </p>  <p>  It is expected that wave energy technologies will play a part in our energy transition from the 2030&rsquo;s. The WestWave project is a highly innovative project and it is imperative that the technical solution chosen would be appropriate for the energetic wave conditions on the west coast of Ireland. The project represents a necessary step towards the development of, potentially, the world&rsquo;s first commercial wave energy array.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.</p>  <p>  Action 31 of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017, which Minister Kyne and I published on 21 February 2018, commits ComReg to developing and subsequently publishing on its consumer website a composite national coverage map, which will enable consumers across Ireland to make better informed decisions when choosing telecommunications service providers.</p>  <p>  The composite national coverage map is due to be published by end Q4 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition to the development of the national coverage map, a number of other initiatives are under way, which will address mobile coverage blackspots:</p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing, and has been included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. It is planned to have dedicated GIS resources in place to support this.</p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority.  The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018.  It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots.  It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - In addition to its work on handset testing, following a consultation process, ComReg has also developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

The PMG has met each month since September 2017 and has considered eleven months of pricing data trends.  The PMG has indicated that, in the vast majority of cases to date, charges have remained stable.  Detailed data on the price offerings for the months of December to July is available on<i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.  The PMG was originally due to complete its work in June this year; however, I decided to extend the operation of the PMG to the end of the year to allow it to continue to monitor pricing developments.  The operation of the PMG may be extended further if I, in conjunction with other relevant stakeholders, feel there is a need to continue to monitor pricing developments in the waste market.</p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is also currently conducting a separate study on the operation of the household waste collection market which it will complete in 2018.

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.</p><p>In light of its significant health benefits, I decided to extend the ban nationwide. This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Government Departments and Agencies and the residential fuel industry. Discussions with stakeholders on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban are underway. </p><p>Local Authorities, are primarily responsible for the enforcement of legislation on solid fuel including the &lsquo;smoky coal&rsquo; regulations within their functional areas at present.  </p><p>For householders who rely on solid fuel for heating, there is now a range of innovative low smoke solid fuel products, including low smoke coal products, available on the market. Low smoke solid fuel is cleaner and more energy-efficient. It can deliver improved air quality as well as human health benefits. Consumers should contact their solid fuel provider to clarify which of their products are low smoke and which are not. </p><p>In relation to cost, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has published figures comparing the respective costs of domestic fuels.  These are available online at <i></i>and show that while low smoke fuels are typically more expensive to buy on a weight-by-weight basis, they have a higher heat output than coal or lignite nuggets.</p></reply>

Supplementary secondary legislation such as the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations, 2009, together with specific local authority bye-laws, all reflect the waste hierarchy and complete the legislative framework in this regard.  The inspectorate staff of the local authorities and/or the Environmental Protection Agency is charged with oversight.

This draft legislation proposes new EU-wide rules to target the 10 most prevalent single-use plastic (SUP) products found on Europe's beaches and seas, as well as lost and abandoned fishing gear, which together account for 70% of all marine litter.  The proposal includes:</p><p>- proposed bans on certain plastic products, including, cotton buds, plastic cutlery and straws;</p><p>- setting targets for both reducing the use of certain plastics (including coffee cups) and the collection of  certain SUPs such as plastic drinks bottles;</p><p>- placing obligations on producers of SUP items to help cover the costs of their waste management and clean up through the establishment of extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes. </p><p>The full text of the legislative proposal which sets out all the measures contained therein is available at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The Commission has indicated that this proposal should be treated as a priority by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in order to deliver tangible results within a short timeframe.</p><p>Nationally, I am engaging in a range of initiatives, including commissioning a study to explore how we can achieve the 90% target for plastic bottles sought by the Commission in the proposed SUP Directive.  I am cognisant, however, that the Commission has warned of the risk of market fragmentation when Member States take measures in an uncoordinated manner, which differ in scope, focus and ambition level.  Therefore, my immediate focus is to work closely with the Commission and my EU counterparts to ensure this proposed Directive is progressed as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the second period of the Kyoto Protocol, (2013-2020), will be discharged via the 2009 EU Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC (ESD).  The ESD established annual emission limits for the period 2013 to 2020 for each EU Member State.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>  <p>  While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, and the consequent increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular.  The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p>  <p>  The ESD includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets, including provisions to bank any excess allowances to future years and to trade allowances between Member States.  Using banked emissions allocations from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2017.  However, cumulative emissions are projected to exceed annual targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis is ongoing to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.</p></reply>

It is expected that the first renewable electricity auctions will take place under RESS in 2019.   The RESS has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework. The RESS will deliver a broad range of policy objectives including: the provision of pathways and supports for communities to participate in renewable energy projects; broadening the renewable electricity technology mix and increasing energy security, energy sustainability and ensuring the cost effectiveness of energy policy.</p>  <p>  The scheme will provide for a renewable electricity (RES-E) ambition of up to a maximum of 55% by 2030 subject to determining the cost effective level which will be set out in the draft National Energy and Climate Plan.</p>  <p>  The new scheme will be defined by a series of renewable electricity auctions, where the most cost effective projects within an auction structure will receive financial support in the form of a premium, in addition to the price they receive from the market. In addition to this competitive, cost effective framework, the use of certain &lsquo;levers&rsquo; such as near term delivery dates and &lsquo;single technology caps&rsquo;, will accelerate the broadening of the renewable technology mix, particularly in light of falling costs for a number of renewable technologies.</p>  <p>  An important consideration in developing and expanding renewable energy support schemes is that a careful balance must be struck between the subsidy to renewable generators, whether they be large or small, and the additional costs to pay for these schemes that are transferred to electricity bill payers. Proposals for all such schemes must be subject to robust economic appraisal. </p>  <p>  Finally, in July I launched a pilot support scheme for micro generation, targeting domestic customers and solar PV, with an emphasis on self-consumption and battery storage.</p></reply>

The Connections Policy appraises both domestic and industrial/commercial demand, and so proximity to a major pipeline and a large industrial/commercial gas load tend to be the most significant factors in town appraisals.</p>  <p>  The last assessment of this region concluded that it is not economically viable to connect Ballyconnell, or any other areas in Co. Cavan.  However, this outcome may change in the future depending on the emergence of significant new demand for gas connections in the locality.  I note that the &ldquo;Gas to the West&rdquo; project in Northern Ireland is now well into the construction stage, as regards both the high-pressure, cross-country, pipeline and the intermediate-pressure distribution pipelines. </p>  <p>  To address the question as to whether network extensions, where economically feasible and in line with our energy policy, could contribute to regional and rural development, I commissioned a study last year on the wider costs and benefits of gas network extensions, to include possible climate and decarbonisation aspects, as well as regional and rural development benefits.  As advised to the information seminar organised for stakeholders on the study in January, the study was for the purpose of technical evaluation, analysis and information-gathering.  It has since been completed.  The results of the study will be presented to me by the consultants in the coming weeks, with a view to developing next steps to inform and feed into future policy development.</p></reply>

As each charging post consists of two charging points, this gives a total of ten charging points in the county.  There are also charging posts at five locations consisting of a total of ten charging points in County Monaghan.  In addition, there is a fast charging station located in Monaghan Town. </p><p>The <i>National Policy Framework: Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017 to 2030</i>sets out the need for electric vehicle charging in Ireland.  Although the existing capacity of the public charging network is considered adequate, development of infrastructure to meet the growing demand is necessary. </p><p>The majority of the existing network of publicly accessible charge points was rolled out by the ESB through its eCars programme.  This network includes over 70 fast chargers, mainly on national routes.  A map showing the locations of charging points throughout Ireland is available at <i>.</i></p><p>A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network.  The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and has led to an expansion in the supports available for the provision of effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.</p><p>In July, I announced the first Call for Applications for the Climate Action Fund which is one of the four funds established under the <i>National Development Plan 2018-2027</i>as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040.</i>The Climate Action Fund will provide at least &euro;500 million to support initiatives that contribute to the achievement of Ireland's climate and energy targets over the next decade.  This Call for Applications focuses on funding larger scale projects that are scheduled to commence development in 2019 or 2020.  Local infrastructure projects including the provision of electric vehicle charging networks will be eligible to apply.  Further information can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Funding for public charging in local communities can also be accessed through the Better Energy Communities Scheme.  The scheme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, supports community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area.</p><p>Although I cannot provide a timeline for the provision of additional fast chargers in counties Cavan and Monaghan at this point, I expect the supports that are in place, and further proposals that I intend to bring forward later this year, will increase the availability of publically accessible electric vehicle charging.</p></reply>

The post office network has been facing many challenges for some years now with a continuing decline in transaction numbers primarily driven by the move to online payments and online banking, as well as eSubstitution.  Standing still is not an option for the network.</p>  <p>  In April this year An Post announced a renewed vision for the post office network which centres around the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network.  The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members. In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business.</p>  <p>  The agreement represents a necessary first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas. </p>  <p>  As part of its strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail.  Additional services that An Post propose to introduce through the network include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. There is already a rapid expansion of banking services happening with the Smart Current Account and enhanced foreign exchange facilities.  Post offices will have credit card services and will be able to provide loans to small business and personal loans. An Post is committed to ensuring that our post offices will be equipped with the range of services that will attract and retain footfall but these measures are meaningless unless the public use the services provided. Key to the survival of this renewed network is the willingness of all citizens to use it. </p>  <p>  Government business is the backbone of the network. In April this year the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments at post offices.</p>  <p>  While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there is always likely to be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services.  The post office network is the obvious choice as the &ldquo;offline gateway&rdquo; for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens.  Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll a pilot scheme for Digital Assist which will see 10 post offices equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions.  The 10 pilot schemes are being currently rolled out in rural post offices. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have secured Government approval to explore how further services might be made available to our &ldquo;offline citizens&rdquo;.  This would be delivered via a centralised procurement framework.  A Working Group comprising representatives across Government Departments is to be established to consider this issue and will report back by the end of year.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for projects such as Dale Road would have been considered as part of the Specific Improvement Grant Scheme for regional and local roads. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The NDP does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific Grant Programme.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific Grant Programme are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  As required under the capital project appraisal process Kerry County Council has submitted a Preliminary Appraisal in relation to the upgrade of this road. Once that appraisal is assessed, taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget, my Department will respond to Kerry County Council. </p></reply>

The process is very thorough and involves a variety of professional bodies, including the Garda&iacute;, the Irish Coastguard, Met Eireann and the RNLI before completion and submission to the Board.</p><p>Following its investigation, the MCIB makes its recommendations. In this case, the recommendations included the undertaking of a highly visible information poster campaign on piers and launching areas relating to life jackets, VHF radio and emergency contact details and in particular the importance of the need to wear a PFD (Personal Flotation Device) in order to improve the chance of survival when an accident occurs.</p><p>A number of actions were taken by my Department to support these recommendations including the issuing of two marine notices relating to the use of PFDs. Furthermore, the Marine Safety Working Group (MSWG), chaired by the Irish Maritime Administration, a division within my Department produces booklets and posters entitled &quot;Safety on the Water&quot; providing basic safety guidelines and advice for recreational craft users, fishermen, divers etc. who take to the waters of Ireland. The Group&rsquo;s aim is to create and communicate marine safety information and messages to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish Waters. It co-ordinates the publication of water safety messages through media broadcasts, publications, brochures and posters including increasing public awareness of the requirement to wear PFDs, use of VHF radio and emergency contact numbers.</p><p>In addition to the above actions, my Department also promotes the use of PFDs through its circulation of The Code of Practice for the Safe Operation of Recreational Craft, which was revised in 2017 and gives straightforward safety advice on best practice to operators and owners of recreational craft.  . </p><p>I understand that this has been a difficult time for both families and I hope that you are reassured by my Department&rsquo;s efforts to ensure the safety of all while at sea.  </p></reply>

The location is within Irish controlled airspace but over international waters and, as such, the matter would not be the subject of an investigation by the relevant Irish authorities. </p>  <p>  In this context, it is important to make a distinction between Irish "sovereign" airspace and Irish &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; airspace. </p>  <p>  Irish sovereign airspace, by definition and international agreement, is the portion of the atmosphere controlled by Ireland above its territory, including its territorial waters (i.e. 12 nautical miles out from the coastline). Airspace beyond a country&rsquo;s territorial limit is termed &ldquo;international&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Ireland, as a party to international agreements, provides certain air traffic management services in some parts of international airspace, including the Shannon UIR. However, the relevant international treaty sets out that when the location of an incident cannot be established as being within or over the territory of another State, the State of Operator, after consultation with the State of Registry, should accept full or partial responsibility for the conduct of the investigation. </p>  <p>  In this instance, it was established that the event did not occur in the territory of the State, as it was beyond the 12 mile territorial limit.</p></reply>

My Department's high level policy goal for accessible public transport is embodied in the concept of 'Transport Access for All'. This policy is based on the provisions of the Disability Act 2005 and related Government strategies, in particular the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.</p>  <p>  Accessibility features, such as wheelchair access, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage. Newer systems such as LUAS are fully accessible.</p>  <p>  My Department funds an ongoing programme of accessibility improvement grants to upgrade older existing infrastructure and facilities which is managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA). In Budget 2018 I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the accessibility retro-fit programme to &euro;28m, as part of the 4 year capital envelope announced. This additional funding will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet.</p>  <p>  Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 the NTA has functional responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network, as well as having responsibility for the management of the accessibility retro-fit programme.   The NTA has provided information on (i) the accessibility status of existing public transport infrastructure, (ii) the cost of making public transport services wheelchair accessible and (iii) the accessibility improvements planned with the available funding for the 4 year period 2018-2021 under the retro-fit programme. That information is available on my Department's website www.dttas.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the National Development Plan (NDP) over the next ten years and beyond to support the development of an integrated, accessible and sustainable national public transport system.  A number of key new major public transport programmes are proposed to be delivered under the NDP over the period to 2027 and these will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. In addition, there will be continued investment in the retro-fit programme under the NDP.</p>  <p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that the organisation to which he refers is represented on my Department's Accessibility Consultative Committee, which monitors progress in relation to accessible public transport for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In addition, I recently appointed to the Boards of the public transport companies, new directors with direct personal experience of disability. One of these new directors is also a member of the organisation to which the Deputy refers. I look forward to all 5 new directors ensuring that the voices of people with a disability will be heard at the top of those bodies responsible for the provision of public transport.</p></reply>

Surveys are processes and are not single events and can involve a number of surveyors from the MSO specialising in different aspects. They include the owner, the crew and specialist companies such as shipyards representing the owner and ship designers.These surveys also include inspections under various statutory instruments which the MSO has responsibility for.

The medical criteria for issue of the permit are strict and only persons whose mobility is severely and permanently restricted qualify. </p>  <p>  These criteria were revised and clarified in my Department&rsquo;s Review of the Disabled Parking Scheme in 2010. The review recommended revising the eligibility criteria for the disabled parking permit to focus on limitations on mobility rather than on diagnosis of particular medical conditions or illness. This was in line with the original intention of the scheme. Where a condition is associated with a de facto physical inability of the disabled person to walk related to development delay with physical impacts, respiratory problems or cardiac problems, a permit is usually granted as there are measurable criteria to assist making a judgement and a recognised practitioner base to refer to.</p>  <p>  To extend the criteria to include other categories, key stakeholders would need to present a case for a further review of the scheme which I would be willing to give consideration to. This submission would need to take account of the benefit to the person with the particular category of disability from access to the parking spaces designated for disabled persons. A definition of the category, including the point of severity where the need for the permit can be categorised as severe, a mechanism for measurement and the professional body competent to define severity would also be required, along with an estimate of the likely population to be included in the category.</p></reply>

Issues raised in relation to the risk assessment were then clarified at meetings that took place between the relevant officials after that date.</p><p>I gave my consent to the transfer on 11 July and Minister/PER (as a Shareholder) gave his consent on 17 July and signed the Order for transfer. The Order was then sent to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in mid July. </p><p>The current Board of Directors is as outlined below:</p><p>Ms Eithne Scott Lennon (Chair)Expiry of term  23 September 2018</p><p>Mr Mark Finan  Expiry of term  11 February 2019</p><p>Mr James JordanExpiry of term  11 February 2019</p><p>Mr Gerry Dunne CEOEx&ndash;officio</p></reply>

It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  AIM supports children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-school where they can learn and socialise with their peers.  It includes 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted.  The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.</p>  <p>  In relation to this particular child, Pobal has advised that the orders for the Wall Mounted Changing Table and the Shelf Unit with Doors have been sent to the HSE and are being processed by them.  As soon as they have processed the requests, both items will be ordered and delivered directly to the Centre.  The items will be paid for directly by Pobal on behalf of my Department, and there will therefore be no requirement for funding to the Service in relation to these items.</p></reply>

This measure adds to previous enhancement of the programme and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from the original 38 weeks to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years).  This delivers on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children and families.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that age limits have been used to determine eligibility since the inception of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme in 2010.  These rules are a necessary component of any Government scheme and ensure that Exchequer funding is used for its intended purpose. </p>  <p>  The upper age limit for the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was set in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills.  It ensures that children transition into primary school with their peers and limits the age range of children beginning primary school.  Limiting the diversity in age ranges in children beginning primary school education is considered generally to be in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations. </p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness, it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied evenly.  An essential component of the ECCE programme rules is an eligibility start date to ensure that the programme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.  As stated above, the Department of Education and Skills informed the policy which these rules support.</p></reply>

It is critical that the Government continues to invest in the early years sector to benefit all children and family types and I am very much committed to continuing to push for this investment.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme we are developing will provide us with a great infrastructure from which to support childcare costs for parents.  Other initiatives introduced this year and last such as the expansion of the free pre-school scheme to two years and the introduction of universal payments for children under 3 are already having an impact.</p>  <p>  Further investment in childcare is currently being considered in the context of the budget/estimates process.  As this process has not yet been finalised, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot go into specific detail on my plans.</p></reply>

This year has seen an improvement in the timeline for delivery with the initial notifications reaching applicants by early June.  This will give successful applicants more time to complete their capital projects and will also facilitate a more timely review process.</p>  <p>  There has been a review process put in place for services that wished to receive feedback and a review of their application.  This process, like the appraisal process, is being managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  The review process is on-going and every service that applied will be treated in a fair and impartial manner.  The service in question has already applied for a review and will be informed of the outcome directly when Pobal have concluded the process. </p></reply>

The cost to parents to access childcare is set by childcare providers who must factor in these overheads.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am committed to ensuring that childcare is affordable, accessible and of a high quality.</p><p>My Department monitors the cost of childcare closely and will continue to do so.  Research from a sampling of services showed that fee increases across all services delivering full-time childcare rose by &euro;7.13<b></b>or 4.3% per week<b></b>on average between 2015/16 and 2016/17 following a number of years of price stagnation.  Further more up to date information is currently being compiled in respect of the 2017/2018 programme year.  This will be published in November and I do not expect a significant increase in the average fee figure.</p><p>In addition &euro;18.65m was allocated to providers in Programme Support Payments in June and July 2018.  The Programme Support Payment is intended to recognise the important role that childcare providers play in the delivery of childcare subvention schemes to families within their services.  This may include for example costs associated with administrative work, time spent assisting parents in understanding how they can most benefit from the DCYA-funded schemes or other non-contact activities.  Programme Support Payments were made available for both the ECCE programme and the targeted CCS related schemes.</p></reply>

Each Family Resource Centre (FRC) operates autonomously, working inclusively with individuals, families, communities, and both statutory and non-statutory agencies.</p><p>Services provided by FRCs across the country vary considerably, depending on the size of the centre, local demographics, level of service usage, and the extent of other local services.</p><p>There are nine Family Resource Centres in Donegal at present, and a new FRC is currently being established in Stranorlar, Co. Donegal. The range of family access facilities available in FRCs in County Donegal is outlined as follows:</p><p>- Donegal Family Resource Centre provides an unsupervised family access facility which requires a signed agreement between the centre and the family concerned. Families may be directed by the courts to use the facility or can access it directly. </p><p>- St. Johnston and Carrigan's Family Resource Centre provides supervised and unsupervised family access facilities.  Use of this facility also requires a signed agreement between the centre and the family concerned. </p><p>- Unsupervised family access facilities are also available through the following FRCs:</p><p>1. The Forge Family Resource Centre, Pettigo, </p><p>2. Meevagh Family Resource Centre, Downings, </p><p>3. Dunfanaghy Family Resource Centre, </p><p>4. Raphoe Family Resource Centre. </p><p>- Family access facilities are not available in Cara House Family Resource Centre, Downstrands Family Resource Centre, or Moville Family Resource Centre. </p><p>Tusla has advised that it anticipates that a family access facility will be available in the new Finn Valley Family Resource Centre in Stranorlar when the service is fully operational.</p><p>Court-ordered family access arrangements are also facilitated by Tusla social workers in Letterkenny, Buncrana and Donegal town. </p><p>Tusla recognises Family Resource Centres as an important component of its service delivery model, and will continue to work with them to provide services to children and families in Donegal and throughout the country.</p></reply>

This measure refines the development introduced last year and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years).  This delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that age limits have been used to determine eligibility since the inception of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme in 2010.  These rules are a necessary component of any Government scheme and ensure that Exchequer funding is used for its intended purpose.  In 2010, only one ECCE year, or 38 weeks, was available.  From September 2018, the additional investment secured in Budget 2018 will enable all children from the age of 2 years and 8 months to be eligible for two full programme years.</p>  <p>  The upper age limit of 5 years and 6 months for ECCE was set in consultation with senior officials from the Early Years Education Policy Unit in the Department of Education and Skills and is consistent with the law in Ireland with regard to school start age and the associated policy of the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, it ensures that children transition to primary school with their peers and limits the age range of children beginning primary school.  Limiting the diversity in age ranges in children beginning primary school education is considered generally to be in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.</p>  <p>  My Department does its best to ensure, in so far as possible, the equitable treatment of all children and families who apply for childcare funding under the ECCE Programme.  In order to ensure objectivity and fairness it is essential that clear rules exist for the scheme and that they are applied in a fair manner. An essential component of the ECCE scheme&rsquo;s rules is an eligibility date to ensure that the scheme can be administered and budgeted for in an appropriate manner.</p></reply>

This measure refines the development introduced last year and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from an average of 61 weeks, to a duration of 76 weeks or two complete programme years.  This delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  This minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice.  It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years care and education in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios.  The upper age limit for the ECCE programme will remain the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they will be 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).</p>  <p>  In order for a child to be eligible to be enrolled for the ECCE 2018/2019 childcare programme to begin on 1st September 2018, they must have been born between 1st January 2014 and 31st December 2015, i.e. they must have reached 2 years and 8 months on or before 31 August 2018.</p>  <p>  In the examples cited by the Deputy, these children born in January and March 2016 will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2018 as they will not have reached the minimum age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August 2018.  However, they will be able to commence ECCE in September 2019, and if they decide to do so continue for a further year from September 2020, commencing school in September 2021 thus availing of the full 2 years.</p>  <p>  Some families of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at 4 rather than 5.  These families may therefore opt for one year of ECCE only.  This decision is entirely at the discretion of the parent(s) or guardian but it is important to reiterate that two full years of ECCE provision is available to all children.</p>  <p>  In such circumstances, it should be noted that the new universal subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 per year, is available to parents of children in registered childcare until the child is eligible for ECCE.

This Act provides that where the Ombudsman for Children conducts an investigation under the Act, he shall send a statement of the result of the investigation to  the public body concerned and to the relevant the Department of State.  The investigation has not concluded and I can confirm that my Department has not received this statement as yet.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Operational Review of Oberstown Children Detention Campus that was commissioned by the Board of Management of Oberstown was received in February 2017.  The full recommendations from this report were published in July 2017. </p>  <p>  I am monitoring the progress of the implementation of the recommendations from this report and a number of other reviews which were commissioned at the same time.  In this regard, I established a Review Implementation Group which began work in March 2017.  The Group prepared a report in December 2017, which contained the collated recommendations from all of the reviews.  The updated Action Plan from the Review Implementation Group was completed in May 2018 and was published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  A key priority for the Department is the implementation of key recommendations to bring about improvements in standards, which is now well underway. </p>  <p>  The Operational Review was carried out following a particularly difficult time in Oberstown.  However, I am advised by Oberstown management that the environment in Oberstown is now more stable.  There is evidence of positive change in the day to day operations.  I met with some young people when I visited Oberstown on a number of occasions in recent months.  These young people were anxious that it be known that there are many positives about Oberstown.  Given the passage of time it is considered that it would be misleading to publish the report now, having regard to progress that has been achieved in the interim.</p>  <p>  Additionally, it is imperative that those commissioning the report must be satisfied that fair procedures were applied before publication.  I have received a number of legal advices in relation to publication of the report of the Operational Review of Oberstown Children Detention Campus, the most recent of which was received in April 2018.  I wished to be assured that fair procedures had been followed in relation to all persons referred to in the report, before it can be published.  I sought assurance from the Board that it was satisfied that fair procedures were applied.  The Board has not been in a position to provide such assurances to date and on this basis it is not proposed to publish the report.  </p>  <p>  As part of its recent inspection of Oberstown, HIQA was invited to review the report. It is expected that HIQA will consider any issues and concerns in its inspection report as appropriate.</p></reply>

These rules are a necessary component of any Government scheme and ensure that Exchequer funding is used for its intended purpose.  In 2010, only one ECCE year, or 38 weeks, was available.  This was enhanced in 2016 and, on average, children benefitted from 61 weeks.  From September 2018, the additional investment secured in Budget 2018 will enable all children from the age of 2 years and 8 months to be eligible for two programme years.</p>  <p>  The number of entry points is reverting to one at the beginning of the 2018/2019 programme year (September).  The three ECCE entry points  which were available for the years 2016/2017 and 2017/2018, created disruption for both service providers and parents seeking a childcare place for their child. One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year.  One entry point will also make it simpler for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p>  <p>  I do, however, fully accept that the use of age limits in a scheme such as this creates a situation whereby a child can fall just outside the age range.  Although my Department is examining all options around this issue, there are no immediate plans to revise the ECCE rules beyond the changes being introduced this month.  A consideration of any future change would need to have regard to a wide range of issues as to what is in the best interests of all of the children participating in the scheme. </p>  <p>  Some families of children may prefer for their children to start school at 4 rather than 5.  These families may therefore opt for one year of ECCE only.  This decision is entirely at the discretion of the parent(s) or guardian but it is important to reiterate that two full years of ECCE provision is available to all children.</p>  <p>  In such circumstances, it should be noted that the new universal subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 per year, is available to parents of children in registered childcare until the child is eligible for ECCE.

It carried out a cross referencing exercise with the GRO on these cases. Based on this process there was a concern in relation to illegal birth registrations in these and a number of other cases.  </p>  <p>  However, it has not to date been possible for the Adoption Authority of Ireland to reach the high level of certainty, following a rigorous process, that these individuals' births were in fact illegally registered as was achieved by Tusla in relation to the recent 126 Saint Patrick's Guild cases.</p>  <p>  In the case of Saint Patrick's Guild, it was possible to identify and corroborate illegal registrations on the basis of the information on the files, and in particular the marker "adopted from birth".</p>  <p>  The process for the potential cases identified by the AAI is not as straightforward.  It may not be possible to identify a record in each case, as the only records in the possession of the Adoption Authority are domestic adoption records from 1953 and a small number of records from former adoption societies. If such records do exist for a case, there is no guarantee that the same level of evidence exists would be on the file which would allow the Adoption Authority of Ireland or Tusla to be satisfied to the same high level of certainty in the Saint Patrick's Guild cases that these individuals' births were in fact illegally registered.</p>  <p>  However following the emergence of the Saint Patrick's Guild cases, I asked the Adoption Authority of Ireland to carry out a further review of their cases to see if further facts can be established. It will carry out this work with the assistance of Tusla.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-07a.3432.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018090700062#WRKKK04700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1198 to 1200, inclusive, and 1228 and 1254 together.</p><p>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the costs of clothing and footwear when children start or return to school each autumn.  The Government has provided &euro;49.5 million for the scheme in 2018.</p><p>The payment rates are &euro;125 for eligible children aged 4 to 11 years and &euro;250 for children aged over 12 years and attending secondary school.</p><p>Each year since 2010 in excess of 100,000 customers can be identified from the Department's computer system as having an automatic entitlement to the allowance so they are notified of their entitlement and there is no requirement for them to make an application.  In addition, approximately 55,000 customers may have an entitlement but need to apply to have this entitlement assessed.</p><p>Similar to arrangements in previous years, the majority of this year&rsquo;s BSCFA payments for 104,461 families in respect of approximately 190,308 children were fully automated and parents were not required to make an application to the Department.  The total amount paid to families with an automatic entitlement was &euro;33.45m and these payments were made during the week commencing 9<sup>th</sup>July 2018.</p><p>In order to qualify for an automated payment the parent of the child must have been in receipt of a qualifying payment that included an increase in respect of a qualified child at the commencement of the scheme and the Department were satisfied that the household satisfied the means test for the scheme.  The scheme commenced from the 1<sup>st</sup>June 2018 with the entitlement created based on the preceding week's entitlement.</p><p>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance is a means-tested allowance.  Qualifying for the allowance in a previous year does not in any way guarantee the customer will receive it in the current year and many customers, especially those who have had a change in their means or circumstance, will need to make an application for the payment for this year in order to have their entitlement validated.  Customers with children aged 18 years or over will also need to apply and provide confirmation that they are in full-time second-level education.  Therefore it is not possible prior to the release of the automatic payments to inform customers that they have no automatic entitlement to the payment.</p><p>Customers who may have received BSCFA in previous years and did not receive written confirmation of entitlement for this year by end June will need to make an application.  Applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance are open until 30 September and application forms are available to download from<i>www.welfare.ie/forms </i>or at local Intreo Centres.  To request a form by post, the customer should text BSCFA1 followed by their name and address to 51909. </p><p>To date (5 September 2018) 130,339 families have been awarded the allowance, 5,642 have been refused and 10,470 are awaiting a decision.  Up to  400 applications are being received on a daily basis.  Expenditure to date on the scheme is &euro;42.8m. </p><p>The BSCFA Area continues to experience delays in processing the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA).  The delays have arisen as a result of a combination of technical issues, and a very high volume of new applications received since the beginning of July.  However, I can assure you that all outstanding claims are being dealt with expeditiously.</p><p>Customers who are experiencing particular difficulties with back to school costs and have yet to receive the allowance can contact their local Community Welfare Service (CWS) to seek financial assistance by way of a basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) which is fully recoupable from the BSCFA due.</p><p>The number of customers who received an automatic payment and those who were paid on foot of submitting an application  in the years 2011 to date are set out in the attached tabular statement.  All payments prior to 2011 were on foot of an application being submitted.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Auto payments made in July</th><th>Manual payments</th><th>Total payments</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>139,000</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>162,000</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>127,000</td><td>69,000</td><td>196,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>115,000</td><td>70,000</td><td>185,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>115,000</td><td>66,000</td><td>181,000</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>113,000</td><td>54,000</td><td>167,000</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>105,000</td><td>48,000</td><td>153,000</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>109,000</td><td>45,000</td><td>154,000</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>107,000</td><td>44,000</td><td>151,000</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>104,000</td><td>26,000*</td><td>130,000*</td></tr></table></p><p>*provisional</p></reply>

However, ratification presented an opportunity to raise awareness of the rights of domestic workers, and, to this end, the then National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) - which has since become part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) - published a booklet on the employment rights of domestic workers in Ireland  to coincide with ratification.  The Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI) also used the opportunity to raise awareness of domestic workers' rights.  </p>  <p>  A &ldquo;domestic worker&rdquo; is defined in the Domestic Workers Convention as &ldquo;any person engaged in domestic work within an employment relationship&rdquo;.  Domestic work may involve a range of tasks, including cooking, cleaning a house, washing and ironing laundry, general housework, looking after children, the elderly or persons with disabilities, and maintaining gardens. </p>  <p>  There is no legal definition of the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; in Irish legislation, and individuals described as &ldquo;au pairs&rdquo;, &ldquo;nannies&rdquo; or &ldquo;child-minders&rdquo; are not exempted or treated as separate categories of workers under Irish employment law.  Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment, on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  For example, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 requires that any persons working under a contract of employment be paid the statutory National Minimum Wage.  For the purposes of this Act, this means a contract of service or apprenticeship, or any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person.</p>  <p>  Where the WRC receive a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, they will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law.  The question as to whether a person is an employee or not is generally established by reference to the provisions of existing employment legislation and established contract law, regardless of any title or designation given to the individual.  Complaints involving "au pairs" are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 914,000 customers with direct eligibility with an annual allocation of &euro;90 million. </p><p>Persons resident in Ireland who are over 66 and persons in receipt of certain social welfare payments are eligible for the scheme.  The social welfare payments that allow persons aged under 66 to a free travel pass include disability allowance, invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s allowance and partial capacity benefit.  </p><p>The &ldquo;Make Work Pay&rdquo; Initiative allows people with long term disability payment who move off the payment to get a job retain their Free Travel Card for a period of five years, providing all other qualifying conditions for the free travel scheme are satisfied. </p><p>The initiative came into effect from the 6<sup>th</sup>April 2017.  Therefore only people who move off long term disability payment to get a job from this date can retain their Free Travel Card for a period of five years.  </p><p>Any decision to amend this policy can only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for the SPC, and applies to homemaking periods since 6 April 1994.  It equally applies to both men and women.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person age 12 or over will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of determining the rate of their entitlement to SPC. In this way the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme ensures that an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to SPC is protected during periods spent caring.</p></reply>

Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed term.  These placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  There are participation limits in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme.</p>  <p>  A number of new conditions were introduced on CE in July 2017 to further support progression and broaden access to CE to a wider range of people.  In general all CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years will be for 1 year - however CE participants, working towards a major award, can seek to extend participation by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification.  In addition, those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for three years.</p>  <p>  An overall lifetime limit of 6 years will apply to all CE participants.  A person may re-qualify for CE after 12 months of being in receipt of a qualifying payment, provided they have not reached their 6 year limit.  Persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked social welfare payment will be eligible for an overall lifetime limit of 7 years.</p>  <p>  Participants over age 62 are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.  The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are subject to a limitation criteria. </p>  <p>  On the other hand, T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which aims to provide short-term work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  The duration of the T&uacute;s contract, which is a maximum of 12 months, was set to reflect a number of inter-related elements which ensures the following:</p>  <p>  (a)  that the number of placements available are open to those on the live register,</p>  <p>  (b)  that weaknesses identified in other work programmes resulting from longer duration placements are not replicated in T&uacute;s, and</p>  <p>  (c)  to ensure that T&uacute;s fits in with the objectives set out in the Government&rsquo;s activation policies in Pathways to Work.</p>  <p>  This approach ensures that as many people as possible who are unemployed for over 12 months are able to benefit from the initiative.  The existing 12 months duration on the scheme is deemed to be adequate to meet the programme&rsquo;s objectives.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to extend the duration of placement beyond twelve months for any T&uacute;s participant, regardless of their age.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability.  Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 629,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018. </p><p>Given the universality of Child Benefit, extending entitlement to parents of full time students in second level education who are over 18 years of age would not be a targeted approach.  The adoption of such a proposal would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p><p>Families on low incomes can avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p><p>- Increase for a Qualified Child (IQCs) with primary social welfare payments;</p><p>- the Working Family Payment (formerly Family Income Supplement) for low-paid employees with children;</p><p>- the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance for low income families (paid at the full-time second-level education rate). </p><p>These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education. </p><p>Any changes to extend eligibility for Child Benefit would have to be considered in the overall budgetary process. </p></reply>

They are not employees of my Department nor are they public servants, and as such they were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants. </p>  <p>  The supervisor pension scheme issue is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded </p>  <p>  Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector.  However, the Deputy should note that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p></reply>

I launched a public consultation on this proposal earlier this year in May.  This closed last Monday, the 3rd of September.  My Department has now started studying the submissions.  Following examination and consideration of the submissions to the consultation, my officials will prepare proposals for the design of the new approach for consideration by the Government in due course.</p>  <p>  Separately, I announced on 23rd January an interim TCA for those affected by the 2012 rate-band changes.  Under this approach, a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 (i.e., who is among those affected by the new ratebands introduced from that date) and who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.</p>  <p>  Up to 20 years of HomeCaring credits, and/or 10 years of other qualifying credits (e.g., when unemployed or ill) may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years. This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  This interim TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.</p>  <p>  Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements, and a number of options regarding the best approach to passing that legislation are being considered. In addition, an information technology system has to be developed in line with the legislation.  My Department is currently working on both of these.  As I've said previously, it is still planned to commence the reviews before the end of this year, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019.  In this regard, the commitment we made in January for the payments to be backdated to the end of last March still stands. </p>  <p>  It is not necessary for people to contact the Department on this matter.  Once the legislation is enacted and the systems and processes are ready, my Department will write to the people impacted and provide them with the opportunity to have their pension calculation reviewed.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This change is part of a programme of modernisation in the Department&rsquo;s Illness Benefit section which took effect from Monday 6 August.  The Department&rsquo;s intention in implementing this modernisation programme - including the changes to forms - is to improve the certification processes and to make claim and payment procedures more efficient for everyone involved &ndash; GPs, patients and the Department. The introduction of the new forms was discussed with the Irish Medical Organisation in advance.</p>  <p>  The majority of certificates and claim forms being received each day by the Department are the new scannable versions and these claims are being processed without any delays.</p>  <p>  Some GPs have continued to use the old forms after this changeover date. In order to facilitate the continued payment of Illness and Injury Benefit to our customers, my Department has, to date, continued to accept old MC1 and MC2 forms where provided by GPs.

This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit, treatment benefit (from March 2017).  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.</p>  <p>  This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the PRSI Class A rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of Class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These Class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.</p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to the self-employed paying Class S PRSI was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance fund as at 31 December, 2015, which I published in October 2017.  The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.</p>  <p>  The review found that the fund currently has a modest surplus of income over expenditure. In 2016 there was a surplus of &euro;0.4 billion on expenditure of &euro;8.8 billion and receipts of &euro;9.2 billion.  However, this will reduce over the next two years and will return to a small shortfall in 2020.  The annual shortfalls are projected to increase from 2021 onwards as the ageing of the population impacts.  Projections indicate that, in the absence of further action to tackle the shortfall, the excess of expenditure over income of the fund will increase significantly over the medium to long term.  The shortfall in expenditure over income is projected to increase from &euro;0.2 billion in 2020 to &euro;3.3 billion by 2030 and to &euro;22.2 billion by 2071.  It should be noted that as self-employed workers were to be eligible to apply for invalidity pension from December 2017, the cost of this introduction has been factored into the actuarial review&rsquo;s findings.</p>  <p>  As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to Class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.</p>  <p>  The review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for PRSI Class S contributions is estimated to be &euro;118 million in 2018, rising steadily to &euro;223 million in 2020.  By 2025 the projected cost is &euro;413 million and, over the period of the review the cost would rise to &euro;1.3 billion in 2071.  </p>  <p>  The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the Class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.</p>  <p>  This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI Class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI Class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total Class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.</p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review provides government with a timely and evidence-led opportunity to undertake a full review of our social insurance system and to consult with stakeholders.  The review will take account of the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.  </p></reply>

This document has been drafted to underpin a consultation process, to help improve the decisions that need to made in terms of the operational structure and design of AE for Ireland.  However, the Strawman should not, in any way, be construed as a confirmation of what form AE will ultimately take or as a document that is intending to provide &lsquo;all of the answers&rsquo;.  It is a high level draft intended to generate and prompt discussion and improve ideas.</p>  <p>  In the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023, the Government confirmed that under an AE system, the State will support employees by financially incentivising retirement saving. Moreover, the Government believes that any financial incentive for AE should be effectively communicated, easily understood and appreciated.  For the purpose of the Strawman, the State&rsquo;s incentive for people to participate in the system is presented as a contribution worth &euro;1 for every &euro;3 that the employee contributes towards their retirement savings account.  Under the Strawman proposals, any AE contributions made by the State will replace, rather than augment, existing tax reliefs.</p>  <p>  The Strawman makes clear the value and the mechanism for providing this incentive will only be finalised following the public consultation.  The Strawman also refers to a separate review of the cost of funded supplementary pensions to the Exchequer, which is currently being carried out by the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group, chaired by the Department of Finance.  The outcomes of these processes, together with further detailed analysis and evidence building, will inform future Government decisions relating to the level of financial incentive for AE and the most appropriate manner in which this incentive should be delivered.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

While not yet complete, ComReg has proposed a number of measures aimed at addressing a range of issues, including that of call costs and has published a response to its latest round of consultations with a range of interested parties.  That publication is entitled "Review of Non-Geographic Numbers: Response to Consultation and Draft Decision &ndash; Reference ComReg 18/65 &ndash; 11/07/2018".</p>  <p>  My Department is currently in the process of reviewing the use of NGNs as part of a wider review of its telephone policy and is considering the possible and likely implications of ComReg&rsquo;s  recent publications on this topic. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, and mindful of the cost  of "LoCall" numbers for some customers, my Department endeavours to ensure that where &ldquo;LoCall&rdquo; numbers are listed on the Departments website, that a landline number is always listed first, ahead of the available &ldquo;LoCall&rdquo; number.  Furthermore, where &ldquo;LoCall&rdquo; numbers are listed on the website, they are accompanied by a notification advising customers that the rates charged for the use of same may vary among different service providers.  Also, please be advised that if customers have any concerns about call charges, the staff of my Department will always facilitate a call back.  </p>  <p>  Besides a range of &ldquo;LoCall&rdquo; numbers, my Department also offers a Freephone service for callers wishing to contact the Homeless Women, Families and New Communities, and Homeless Men&rsquo;s Units.  A dedicated team handles high volumes of calls to these services via the Freephone (&ldquo;1800&rdquo;) number provided by my Department.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy refers to the arrangements in place regarding NGNs within agencies that fall under the remit of my Department.  Offices and statutory bodies within that category are wide ranging, and include the General Register Office (GRO), the Social Welfare Appeals Office, the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Pensions Council, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Authority, the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Low Pay Commission.  As protocols in place to manage the use of NGNs is an operational policy matter, responsibility for same is held locally.  Therefore, I am not in a position to comment in this regard.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Lot 1 is for Print and Digital Media Monitoring, Lot 2 is for Broadcast Media Monitoring and Lot 3 is for Social Media Monitoring.  </p>  <p>  Daily media monitoring provides the Department with an important understanding of policy issues, economic issues and customer issues that may have implications for the Department&rsquo;s customers and other stakeholders, and indeed the Department itself.  The ability to monitor media coverage and respond quickly to issues impacting our customers and stakeholders is very important, especially given the scale and nature of the Department&rsquo;s schemes and services, and the wide range of customers it serves on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  The media landscape has changed in recent years and greater use of digital and social media means that policy, economic and customer issues are often communicated on social media in the first instance.  Social media, therefore, represents an important potential news source for the Department. </p>  <p>  As is clearly stated on the first page of the Tender document, &ldquo;tenderers should be aware that the Contracting Authority may elect to proceed with one, two, or all three Lots, as determined by cost and business need&rdquo;.  The inclusion of a Social Media monitoring service in Lot 3 clearly does not commit the Department to procuring such a service now or in the future, but makes provision for this service.</p>  <p>  As the tender process is ongoing, it would not be appropriate to provide further information at this time.</p></reply>

It provides assistance to households with children in recognition of the higher costs incurred in child-raising and child care in a way which allows choice to parents in how this is undertaken. It does not rely on a means test or social insurance contributions.  </p>  <p>  Child Benefit is a monthly payment made to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. It is currently paid to around 629,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of over &euro;2 billion in 2018. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I support the universality of the Child Benefit payment, and the principle that all families with children should receive this income support.

The Government has provided over &euro;36 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2018.  </p>  <p>  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses where there is an inability to pay these costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship.  </p>  <p>  When determining an entitlement to an ENP for funeral expenses the officer will take into account the circumstances of the individual applicant and that of the deceased person including any savings, property, insurance policies etc. that would render the applicant or anybody else liable and/or in a position to pay for the funeral costs. If a bereavement grant is available from any other source including former employer, credit union or trade union, this will also be taken into account. </p>  <p>  The timescale for determining applications may be dependent, among other things, on the availability of supporting documents needed to consider the application.

The scheme came into effect on 6 April 1994 and applies to both men and women.  </p>  <p>  The homemakers scheme allows up to a maximum of 20 homemaking years to be disregarded for State Pension (Contributory) purposes.  The homemakers scheme does not issue social insurance credits for the duration of this period, rather it disregards the years when calculating entitlement to the contributory state pension using the Yearly Average Calculation.  A small number of credits are awarded at the start of the year the period began, and at the end of the year it was completed.  This disregard and those credits are only awarded for the purpose of a State pension (contributory) claim.  They may not be used to qualify for any other payment which a person might apply for when of working age.</p>  <p>  In May my Department launched a public consultation on the introduction of a Total Contributions Approach to calculating the contributory state pension.  Although we are now deliberating on the submissions to the consultation, a move towards introducing homemakers credits to replace the "disregard" is likely (as signposted in the National Pensions Framework). </p>  <p>  How these credits will be communicated to those who have earned them is just one of many technical and logistical issues that will be addressed before we seek to finalise a proposal.  My ambition, however, is that the more simplified nature of the Total Contributions Approach will allow us make more useful information available to future pensioners, than is possible under the current system.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.</p>  <p>  Under the new arrangements a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Crucially, unlike the existing Homemakers disregard system, periods of home-caring before that scheme was introduced in 1994 may be recognised under the new scheme.</p>  <p>  Up to 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may also be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.</p>  <p>  The new TCA for pensioners assessed under the 2012 rate band changes, came into effect from 30 March 2018.  Pensioners do not need to contact the Department at this juncture.  Instead, the Department will invite pensioners who were assessed under the current rate bands in place since 2012 to have their pensions recalculated under TCA to determine if they qualify for a higher rate of entitlement.</p>  <p>  Legislation is currently being prepared to enact these changes.  Following the passing of this legislation, the Department expects to begin sending out these invitations before the end of the year and to begin making payments, including arrears for any period from 30 March 2018, from Quarter 1 of 2019.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are expected to benefit many people who are or who have been in receipt of Carer's Allowance, subject to them satisfying the other conditions regarding the State pension contributory.  If they do not satisfy those conditions, but they have been eligible for the means-tested Carer's Allowance, it is likely that they will qualify for the means-tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State pensions contributory.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Expenditure at end July 2018 is &euro;321,000. </p><p>Following a severe weather event, staff in the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service, closely monitor the situation on the ground and engage with the relevant local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible. Emergency income support payments to cover essential items such as food, clothing and personal items are quickly issued in the immediate aftermath of the event.Financial supports towards the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items may take longer as it is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.  The longer term financial support covers necessary remedial works and can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting.  It could take several months before this stage of the response is completed and final payments issue. Statistics are not maintained on the average waiting times for payment.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p>Expenditure under the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme 2010 &ndash; 2018<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Outturn</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;OOO </td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>1,045</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>714</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>118</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1,189</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>233</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>1,682</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>613</td></tr><tr><td>2018 (July) </td><td>321</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These actions are focused on encouraging those in mortgage distress to reach a long term debt resolution, avoid repossession and remain in their home if possible.</p><p>One of the measures that has been introduced is a national mortgage arrears resolution service, known as Abhaile, which is provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  The Money Advice and Budgetary Service (MABS) acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning 076-1072000 or by accessing their website at the following link www.mabs.ie/abhaile.</p><p>The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme introduced in 2012 and administered by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department is targeted at those households in arrears whose mortgage is unsustainable and who are eligible for social housing support. Under the scheme an eligible household with an unsustainable mortgage goes from being a homeowner to becoming a social housing tenant of an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  The borrower voluntarily surrenders their property to their lender who in turn sells the property to an AHB.  The AHB becomes the landlord and the household can remain in the family home as a social housing tenant.  The tenant pays a differential rent to the AHB, based on their income, which is designed to be affordable.  The MTR scheme is an established part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  </p><p>A Review of the MTR Scheme, published on 8 February 2017, introduced a range of amendments to the eligibility criteria and administration of the scheme in order to improve its operation.  The Review, available at the following link: , explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  The eligibility requirements of the scheme were widened to include a greater number of borrowers and a larger number of property types.  Increasing awareness and understanding of the scheme has been a priority and a new website - www.mortgagetorent.ie - dedicated to guiding and advising borrowers has been developed.  In addition, new structures and arrangements have been put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.</p><p>For those borrowers in danger of losing their home who are ineligible for the MTR scheme but qualify for social housing support, it is recommended that they engage as early as possible with their local authority regarding their housing needs. A household may be determined by their housing authority to be in need of housing if it has a mortgage that is deemed to be unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), even though the household may, at that time, remain the legal owner(s) of the dwelling concerned.  Any household assessed as eligible for social housing support is immediately eligible for support through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme. Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority. </p><p>My Department does not hold data on the number of households whose homes have been repossessed or the potential cost to the Exchequer of supporting these households.  My Department does publish a range of housing statistics on social housing delivery mechanisms.  This data is available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p></reply>

Under these Regulations, annual maximum limits are provided for nitrogen and phosphorus for grassland and tillage crops. The rates are designed to meet the crop and soil requirements whilst minimising the risk of losses of nutrients to waters and air.  There is no provision under the Regulations for increasing the annual maximum limits for nitrogen. </p>  <p>  However, it is acknowledged that the drought this year has impacted significantly on grass growth, causing major difficulties for farmers in the south and east of the country in particular.  Accordingly, following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine, I recently announced that farmers will be allowed as an exceptional measure to spread chemical fertiliser and slurry this year for a fortnight longer than the deadline set out in the Regulations. This offers opportunities for the application of fertilisers later than normally allowed for achieving good grass growth levels through the autumn.</p>  <p>  This, along with other important fodder-related measures recently introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will help to mitigate the fodder challenges currently facing farmers.</p></reply>

These Regulations focus on tenant safety and include new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety.  In August, my Department published a guidance document to assist and support local authorities in implementing the new Regulations.</p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority, previously supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from a portion of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees, collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  </p><p>Since establishment of the RTB, over &euro;36 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.

The Department of Education and Skills, with the support of my Department, has sought to increase the provision of new purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) as a key priority in addressing the housing crisis.  </p>  <p>  In July 2016, my Department provided advice to planning authorities, by way of Circular Letter PL8/2016, regarding matters to consider in relation to proposals for student accommodation. It was made clear that housing for students is a specific and important segment of the overall housing sector with distinct characteristics and requirements. The deficit in student accommodation was highlighted as having a significant related impact on the private rental sector. The increase in the provision of student accommodation was identified as an objective in the Circular and local authorities were encouraged to adopt a positive approach to new PBSA proposals. </p>  <p>  In the consideration of PBSA proposals, local authorities were reminded of the need to establish a steady rental income for such student accommodation developments throughout the year in order to ensure the deliverability of development projects from a funding point of view and to recognise that student accommodation complexes can play an important role in providing affordable accommodation for tourists and visitors in major urban areas during peak summer demand periods. </p>  <p>  At the same time, safeguards are required to ensure that student accommodation is not used as permanent residential accommodation and is restricted to students during the academic year. Planning authorities were therefore directed to attach planning conditions to new permissions related to use/occupation of student accommodation which generally facilitated the use of student accommodation complexes as alternative summer or holiday accommodation but reserved as student housing during the academic year.  </p>  <p>  Such legally binding planning conditions are now generally attached by the local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to new planning permissions for student accommodation. This clarification has assisted in increasing the financial viability of student accommodation through ensuring occupancy of facilities over the entire calendar year. Any breach of the use condition can be investigated by the planning authority under Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). </p>  <p>  Any subsequent proposed change or deviation to another use would require a new and separate planning permission, and would be assessed by the planning authority in the normal fashion, having regard to the overall development plan policy and other considerations pertaining as to the acceptability of alternative use for the development.</p></reply>

Existing guidance to local authorities in this regard, originally outlined in Circular PD5-2007 of 9 May 2007, recommends that local authorities provide for a reduced, or waived, fee in respect of development qualifying for a disabled persons grant.  The guidance further encourages local authorities to apply exemptions in respect of voluntary housing schemes and other community infrastructural projects delivered via voluntary or not-for-profit non-statutory groups, which may include the development of housing and other facilities for disabled persons.  These recommendations are being applied by authorities in their development contribution schemes through a range of exemptions and reduced fees. </p>  <p>  In light of the above, I do not propose to issue any further guidelines on this matter.</p></reply>

I met with the organisation referred to last year on the issue of wheelchair accessible housing and further meetings with my Department have taken place since then. </p><p>One of the key measures achieved in 2016 under the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability (NHSPWD), which has been extended to 2020, was the establishment of Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) in all housing authority areas, to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level.  These are chaired by Directors of Housing in each authority and include HSE and disability representative organisations.  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging need over the next five years. These Plans, along with the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments, allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms. This is a more targeted and responsive way to meet actual need identified rather than designating a specific percentage or number of new social housing builds that are fully wheelchair accessible although some authorities may choose to allocate a percentage if they choose.</p><p>New buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2017.  In this context, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. The TGDs are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability:</p><p>- new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;</p><p>- extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;</p><p>- material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;</p><p>- certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings where practicable; and</p><p>- new dwellings are visitable.</p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions, where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>Guidance on how to design, build and manage buildings and spaces so that they can be readily accessed and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability, is available in 'Building for Everyone, A Universal Design Approach', a National Disability Authority(NDA) publication, which may be accessed at www.nda.ie.</p></reply>

This Scheme will be delivered by local authorities developing their sites in key locations. The Scheme complements other Government Schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p>  <p>  In addition, it is important that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future to fill a gap between social housing and the rental market, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  A number of pilot cost rental schemes are being advanced at Enniskerry Road, in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown and at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, Dublin 8. Once these have progressed satisfactorily, I plan to roll out cost rental across other suitable sites.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing substantial Exchequer funding of &euro;75 million for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  The call for proposals under the Serviced Site Fund issued in June, with a closing date of 31st August.  The bids received from local authorities under this first call are now being assessed and I expect to make initial funding awards early next month.</p>  <p>  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority-owned land.</p></reply>

Section 19 of the Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009 defines RAS as a social housing support.</p><p>The assessment of applications for social housing support, and management of the lists of qualified households, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated regulations.  In the context of the assessment of individual applicants for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to determine the housing solution that best meets the needs of the applicant, while taking into account the resources and type of housing available to the authority.  Once a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the RAS scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of support for that household.</p><p>In the period since RAS commenced in 2005 to the end of March 2018, local authorities had transferred a total of 60,821 households from Rent Supplement to RAS and other social housing options.  Of this number, 34,652 were housed directly under RAS. Based on the 2017 Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), the Department has set a figure of an additional 600 households nationally to transfer from Rent Supplement to RAS supported tenancies during 2018.</p><p>Data on transfers from Rent Supplement to RAS for 2015, broken down by individual local authority, is set out in the following table.  Data for 2016, 2017 and Q1 2018, broken down by individual local authority, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>Data for the years 2015 to 2017 on the number and cost of tenancies funded under the RAS scheme, broken down by local authority, is also available at this link.  As of 31 March 2018, there are 19,522 tenancies supported under RAS, details of which, broken down by local authority, are set out in the attached table. Expenditure on these tenancies during the period January to March 2018 was &euro;13.78m. I have provided &euro;134.3 million in Budget 2018 to support the cost of RAS and this funding will go towards supporting 600 additional RAS tenancies in 2018 and the ongoing cost of supporting continuing RAS contracts in place at the end of 2017. </p><p>RAS remains a significant part of the suite of social housing options available to local authorities and to those who are assessed as being in need of housing support.  With the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) to all local authority areas, the availability of Rent Supplement has changed and is generally no longer available to households with a long-term housing need. This change reduces significantly the numbers of households entering rent supplement support. Equally, as the transfers of existing rent supplement recipients with a housing need to HAP accelerates, the numbers of long term rent supplement recipients eligible for RAS will decline as will RAS transfers.</p><p>Tabular Statements<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th colspan="2"><div>2018 Q1</div></th></tr><tr><td><div> </div></td><td>Outturn</td><td>Tenancies</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow Co.

The Acts provide that landlords in the sector must apply to register a tenancy of a dwelling with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) within one month of the commencement of the tenancy. </p>  <p>  The RTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  The statutory obligation to register a tenancy applies irrespective of the existence of a family relationship between the parties to the tenancy agreement. The RTB actively pursues landlords for non-registration. Failure of a landlord to register a tenancy with the RTB can result in criminal conviction.  If convicted, a landlord faces fines of up to &euro;4,000 and/or six months' imprisonment, along with a daily fine of &euro;250 for a continuing offence.  In addition, if the tenancy is not registered, the landlord cannot avail of the dispute resolution services of the RTB should an issue arise with the tenancy.</p>  <p>  To pursue non-compliant landlords, the RTB receives information on residential rented dwellings from several sources. Where non-compliance is identified, notice and warning letters are sent to the landlord. If the landlord still fails to register, enforcement action is taken through the courts. </p>  <p>  The RTB is planning to move towards annual registration of tenancies, which will permit the building of a national rent dataset. This enhanced data will be key to understanding trends and behaviour in the rental market as well as informing future policy decisions.  While the RTB is continuously seeking to strengthen its registration function, there are no plans at this time to oblige landlords to register properties before the start of a tenancy.</p></reply>

The day-to-day operation of the social housing system including the issue of ensuring that all staff have the necessary skills and expertise required to perform their roles to the highest professional level possible is in the first instance, a matter for the relevant local authority concerned.</p>  <p>  However, mindful of the need to have the best trained staff possible working in the housing area, my Department supports the development of appropriate third level training. To this end, my Department has actively engaged with the Institute of Public Administration (IPA), who have a strong and valued reputation in providing quality third level education particularly to staff in the public sector, to ensure that the right mix of courses are available for local authority and other staff who work in the housing area. The Institute already runs a number of such courses every year, including a year-long Certificate in Housing Studies programme, which I understand is very well availed of by local authority staff across the country.</p></reply>

An overarching action within that Pillar is a commitment to develop a National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy. This Strategy, published in July 2018, strives to provide a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland and contains a range of objectives and key actions which will be pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock.</p>  <p>  Capital funding is provided to local authorities to acquire a range of properties for social housing use. The properties involved can range from those in good condition to those that need remediation and may have been vacant. To ensure a local-led response to such work, responsibility for property acquisitions is delegated to local authorities. To further assist local authorities pursuing vacant properties, funding is available through the Buy &amp;amp; Renew Scheme to facilitate local authorities in acquiring and remediating vacant properties that may be suitable for social housing. As with standard acquisitions, local authorities have delegated responsibility to utilise the Buy and Renew Scheme, as part of the blend of property acquisitions, as appropriate to their area, given housing need and the availability of properties of different types.</p>  <p>  The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed under Pillar 5 to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness the accommodation potential that exists in certain vacant properties across Ireland. The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the relevant local authority or an Approved Housing Body (AHB). As part of the agreement, the property owner then leases the dwelling to the local authority for use as social housing for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs but subject to a minimum of 5 years. The value of the repairs is offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease. The RLS is available in all local authorities, in both rural and urban areas. However, it is a condition of the scheme that the property is an area with a social housing need and fulfils social housing demand.  </p>  <p>  Property owners may also qualify for schemes such as the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) and the Better Energy Homes Scheme. The HRI enables owners to claim tax relief on repairs, renovations or improvement works that are carried out on their main home or rental property. Information on this scheme is available from the Revenue Commissioners or at www.revenue.ie. The Better Energy Homes Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI) to help homeowners and landlords reduce their energy costs and emissions by providing grants towards insulation, heating control and solar thermal improvements on homes occupied and built before 2006. Further details on grant payments and qualifying works are available from the SEAI website at www.seai.ie.</p></reply>

However, Rebuilding Ireland committed all local authorities to adopt a preventative maintenance approach to housing stock management, including consistent standards and the adoption of a common national re-letting performance standard.  To further this aim, the City and County Management Association (CCMA) has re-established a committee to look at the planned maintenance issue and there is on-going dialogue between the CCMA and my Department in order to advance reform in the area. </p>  <p>  The first phase of the regeneration of Dolphin House, Dublin 8, a local authority estate cited in the findings, is nearing completion. This phase consists of the deep retrofitting of three of the existing housing blocks to provide 63 refurbished apartments and 37 new build units comprised of 28 apartments and 9 houses to give an overall total of 100 new and refurbished units. The retrofitting includes externally insulating the walls of the existing blocks to improve their thermal efficiency and the provision of lifts to make all units accessible.  Outdoor spaces will be landscaped and play areas provided within the courtyard areas. Work on site is nearing completion and it is expected that residents will begin to move into the finished units shortly. Work is already underway designing Phase 2 of the regeneration project.  Once the full regeneration is complete, the Dolphin House community will be rehoused in comfortable, retrofitted or new build accommodation and additional units will have been created for new residents.</p>  <p>  The regeneration of St Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens, Donore Avenue, Dublin 8 &ndash; another local authority estate cited in the findings &ndash; is also underway.  Enabling works, demolitions and de-canting has been completed and has paved the way for Phase 1 of the project, which will result in the provision of 54 new homes, comprising 16 apartments and 38 terraced houses.  Two of the existing blocks have been retained in the medium term to provide temporary accommodation pending completion of the new build units.  These have been consolidated and refurbished to provide some 57 units of temporary accommodation, and will ultimately be demolished following completion of the new build units.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;115.7 million has been provided from 2013 to the end of 2017 to improve almost 64,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020. </p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the Programme focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation and is expected to be completed this year.

The review involved discussions with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, the representative body of the Group Water Sector. Discussions concluded in December 2017, when I approved increased subsidy levels. The new subsidy arrangements, endorsed by a special delegate conference of the Federation on 13 December 2017, came into effect on 1 January 2018. Local authorities were advised of the increased subsidy levels on 19 December 2017.</p>  <p>  The changes implement the recommendation contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services (JOCFFDWS), endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in April 2017, that there should be equity of treatment and equivalent financial support between households using public water services and those availing of private water services.</p>  <p>  Additionally the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme provides capital funding opportunities for Group Water Schemes to, if suitably located, interconnect to and be taken in charge by Irish Water (Measure 4 of the multi-annual programme), or amalgamate with nearby Group Water Schemes forming a new larger entity that is more effective, including in their day-to-day running costs, through economies of scale (Measure 1 of the multi-annual programme).</p>  <p>  Measure 3 of the multi-annual programme provides capital funding for schemes to undertake water conservation works to reduce their wastage of water, through carrying out where necessary, replacement of defective water mains thus enabling schemes to reduce their day-to-day running costs.  </p>  <p>  Separate to the initial review of Group Water Scheme subsidy levels and also in fulfilment of the JOCFFDWS recommendations, in April 2018, I established a Working Group to conduct a wider review of investment needs and rural water services. There will be a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 will consider the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-annual Rural Water Programme from 2019 up to 2021, while Strand 2 will consider the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the Rural Water Sector.</p>  <p>  In order to put the review process on the best footing, I have established a significantly increased funding base for the Rural Water Programme. This increase is reflected in the National Development Plan where investment in the Programme is set to rise by &euro;5m or 25% in 2019, and this enhanced level of investment will be maintained for the three year cycle up to 2021.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.7 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 13,400 homes.</p>  <p>  Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process will be included in a report on the initiative that I intend to publish shortly. The publication of the NTICI report will be of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge. I expect that the initiative will contribute to further streamlining of the taking-in-charge process, through, for example, securing coordination with capital works by Irish Water. </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Development Plan includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for DPI.

One of the key elements of the Act is the legal base it provides for the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR).</p>  <p>  My Department is advancing the work necessary to allow me to establish the Office as soon as possible.  An Advance OPR Establishment team has been created within my Department to drive the necessary work for the corporate establishment of the OPR and the appointment of the Regulator.  In that regard, the team have been progressing the recruitment competition and I expect the Public Appointments Service to advertise the position of the Planning Regulator later this month.  In addition, interim premises have been secured for the OPR on Sir John Rogerson's Quay in Dublin, pending the making of long-term leasing arrangements.</p>  <p>  It is intended to add additional staffing supports to the advance team over the coming months to facilitate the smooth transition of work from my Department to the OPR and to finalise the work of corporate establishment.  Once the Regulator is recruited and in place, I will then be in a position to formally establish the Office and to second a small team of staff to the Office to ensure that the core functions can be fulfilled from its inception.  I expect that the Regulator will then begin recruiting the rest of the staff required to fulfil its statutory mandate.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the appointment of the Planning Regulator and the full establishment of the Office as an important measure to help promote and safeguard the quality and integrity of the planning process.</p></reply>

In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.</p>  <p>  Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 lists properties that are exempt from rating purposes.  Schedule 4 was amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 by inserting an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis.  This extension of the childcare and education exemption removed an anomaly that previously existed where parties that provided childcare and education on a charitable basis were exempt but those that did so on a not-for-profit basis were not.</p>  <p>  In addition to the exemption of parties that provide childcare and early education on a not-for-profit basis, paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 also exempts from rates childcare facilities that exclusively provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4.  As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all claimant cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Acts as they relate to pre-school childcare facilities and all other categories of properties.</p></reply>

My Department continues to engage with the Department of Finance in relation to this work.</p>  <p>  Following the completion of the initial analysis, which has defined the scope of the financial implications of this decision for the Exchequer, my Department also held discussions with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that AHBs can continue to fulfil their full potential in the delivery of the targets set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the AHB sector and has had constructive discussions with representative bodies from the sector on the issue.  The sector itself has engaged its own research on the matter and my Department is evaluating that research, as part of its ongoing consideration of the issue.  I understand that the AHB representative bodies have indicated that they intend to submit further proposals to my Department concerning possible suggested ways forward.  All proposals by the AHB sector and other relevant bodies will be evaluated and considered as part of this process as soon as they are submitted.</p>  <p>  I remain fully committed to continuing to work with the AHB sector to assess the options available to create the necessary conditions to allow this classification decision to be revisited in the future.</p>  <p>  As previously noted, the Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland.  It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain the momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the Action Plan.</p></reply>

The group analysed each of the main input costs (land, construction, professional fees, development levies, finance &amp;amp; development margins and VAT).  In parallel, the Housing Agency carried out a separate comparative analysis of international construction costs.</p><p>The initial findings of the Department's review identified the viability of urban apartment schemes at affordable price levels was extremely challenging.  To resolve the current housing shortage, as well as to plan more effectively for our future under Project Ireland 2040, under which more compact growth such as apartments are urgently needed in our urban centres, I established a working group to undertake a focused review of the 2015 Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments &ndash; Guidelines for Planning Authorities to explore how to improve the viability of apartment development in our cities and towns, with a cost analysis also carried out.  The revised guidelines were published in March 2018 and are available at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>To further support the delivery of apartments, I published draft Urban Development and Building Heights Guidelines for Planning Authorities last month for public consultation.  These guidelines set out new and updated national planning policy on building heights in relation to urban areas, elaborating on the strategic policy framework set out in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework, and are part of a suite of integrated measures and policy shifts to break the current patterns and development trends for our cities and towns and create more compact and integrated communities.  The closing date for submissions is Monday, 24 September 2018.</p><p>In summary, my Department published three separate cost reports:</p><p>- <i>Review of Delivery Costs and Viability for Affordable Residential Developments</i>;</p><p>- <i>Cost analysis of the updated &quot;Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments, Guidelines for Planning Authorities&quot;</i>; and</p><p>- <i>Comparison of Residential Construction Costs in Ireland to other European Countries</i>,</p><p>on 12 April 2018, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Each of these reports is important in terms of analysing key elements of delivery in our housing sector as well as providing robust responses.  Viability in affordable home building is essential as the sector recovers and the Government continues to implement solutions in this area.</p><p>As Minister, I have been clear that we need to address housing affordability, recognising the pressures that exist for low- to middle-income households, particularly in Dublin and certain other of our main urban centres.  The delivery of targeted affordable housing, for purchase and rent, was a priority topic at the third Housing Summit which I held with Local Authority Chief Executives in July.  It also featured prominently at the post-Housing Summit meeting with Local Authority Housing Directors of Service.</p><p>Affordability measures to support the provision of more affordable homes include the commencement of a new statutory scheme for affordable purchase which will be complementary to other Government Schemes which help first-time buyers to buy homes, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.  Furthermore, a number of cost rental pilot projects are being developed by local authorities in Dublin, in cooperation with the Housing Agency, Approved Housing Bodies and the European Investment Bank, to provide homes to rent at below market rates, with the intention to roll out the concept across other suitable sites in urban areas.  In addition, Exchequer funding of &euro;75 million is being provided under the Serviced Sites Fund to help to offset the costs of providing both on-site and off-site enabling infrastructure for sites in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  The call for proposals has recently closed and I expect to award an initial tranche of funding next month.</p><p>Finally, the imminent establishment of the new Land Development Agency to assist in ensuring a more effective approach to strategic land management, particularly in terms of publicly owned land with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing, and the creation by my colleague the Minister for Finance of the new Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) initiative, which will provide finance at commercially competitive rates to developers with sites ready-to-go but who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining funding, will also contribute to the increased supply of new homes including homes at more affordable price levels to buy and rent.</p></reply>

Section 22(5) of the Act provides that a water charges plan may provide for charges in respect of the provision of services connections to premises.</p>  <p>  In line with a direction issued by the CRU, Irish Water currently continues to apply the same connection charges for connecting to the public water and/or wastewater network as were applied by local authorities on 31 December 2013. In practice this means that some 57 different connection charging regimes, with over 900 different connection charges, currently continue to apply as each local authority had its own method for calculating connection charges, with different cost structures and customer classifications and differing approaches to service delivery.</p>  <p>  I understand that in 2016 the CRU requested Irish Water to submit a proposal for an enduring Connection Charging Policy for customers seeking a connection to the network. In January 2018, the CRU held a public consultation on the development of the policy for domestic and non-domestic connections to Irish Water&rsquo;s network, known as a National Connection Charging Policy. The Policy will be aimed at developing a more harmonised methodology for connections to the public water and wastewater network.</p>  <p>  In an information note published on its website on 2 August 2018, the CRU indicated that the time-line for publishing its proposed decision on Irish Water's proposed National Connection Charging Policy has been extended, while indicating that it now expects to publish its proposed decision  in the fourth quarter of 2018. The public will be invited at that stage to comment on any additional information included further to the public consultation process, undertaken earlier this year, before the CRU makes its final decision in the matter which it anticipates will be made by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  The CRU as regulator is independent in this matter and will come to its own independent assessment of the appropriate Water Connections Charging Policy, having considered the views of interested parties through the public consultation process.  As Minister, I must respect the statutory powers and functions which the Oireachtas has conferred on the CRU in this matter.</p>  <p>  Details of the average connection fee charged by Irish Water for mains and sewerage for each local authority area in 2016, 2017 and 2018 are an operational matter for which Irish Water has responsibility. It may be helpful in this regard to know that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email at oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

It is an excellent site in the ownership of Dublin City Council that is suited for a mixed tenure approach. Under the Cost Rental model, minimising profit, land costs and other costs and securing very competitive EIB financing mean that much more affordable rents can be achieved than can be delivered through market arrangements.  The on/off balance sheet position of the project will be influenced by the final delivery and financing arrangements.</p>  <p>  While the final tenure mix will be decided by the Council and informed by the detailed site development process, it will include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided under cost rental.</p>  <p>  The final rents will be set after all associated costs are determined, following on from the competitive construction and management tender processes, and I expect that the cost rental scheme should be able to deliver rents of between of 15% to 25% below the market rate. The scheme will be aimed at households earning low to moderate incomes at a maximum of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.  </p></reply>

I asked the task force to oversee and report on this initial action, as well as, among other things, reviewing existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland.</p><p>The work of the task force has now been completed and it has provided me with a full report, titled &ldquo;Fire Safety in Ireland: Report of the Fire Safety Task Force&rdquo;, which describes its work, its conclusions on the state of fire safety in Ireland and its recommendations for moving forward.  </p><p>I have accepted the task force&rsquo;s recommendations, and its report was brought to Government on 6 June 2018.  </p><p>With regard to the review of medium-to-high rise buildings, fire authorities were asked to identify buildings in their functional areas of more than six storeys, or more than 18 metres in height.  In cases where the buildings identified are fitted with external cladding systems, fire authorities were asked to consider if use of powers under section 18(6) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003 &ndash; to require the person having control over the building to carry out a fire safety assessment of the premises and provide the assessment to the fire authority &ndash; was warranted. The most recent figures provided by fire authorities indicate:  </p><p>- 842 buildings have been identified, countrywide, at this height, </p><p>- of these, 291 buildings are fitted with cladding systems, </p><p>- of these, fire authorities required fire safety assessments in 226 cases &ndash; 105 in residential buildings, and 121 in non-residential buildings,  </p><p>- of these, 108 fire safety assessments have been received by fire authorities, </p><p>- of these, fire authorities are proposing further action in respect of fire safety in 19 buildings where fire safety concerns &ndash; not in all cases related to external cladding &ndash; have been identified.  </p><p>This fire safety assessment work is on-going, and will be overseen by fire authorities and the National Directorate. </p><p>My Department issued guidance in December 2017 dealing with fire safety assessment of medium-to-high rise buildings with cladding systems, and including guidance on fire safety measures to be applied in buildings, pending completion of remedial works to cladding systems, where these are considered necessary.  </p><p>By identifying a small number of buildings, so far, where remedial works were required, the review process undertaken is seen to have had a positive effect and to have made contributions to both enhancing fire safety in medium-to-high rise buildings, and also raising fire safety awareness among owners/ landlords with statutory fire safety responsibilities.  </p><p>However, the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower highlights the critical importance of fire safety in buildings, and the need for sustained vigilance in this regard. The Task Force report makes a range of recommendations for improvements to fire safety in buildings, and to provision of fire services in Ireland and I have requested the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management to carry through the recommendations of the report within my direct ambit and to oversee and report on the implementation of other recommendations. </p><p>Copies of both the Report and the Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p>Fire Safety Task Force Report:</p><p><i><i></i></i><i>.</i></p><p>Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

Of the combined target of 137,000 referred to above, just under 45,000 households have had their housing need met by the end of year 2 of the Rebuilding Ireland Plan &ndash; 33% of those targeted under the 6 year Plan as a whole. </p><p>In 2017, 25,901 households had their housing need met, with some 7,095 of these properties delivered through the build/acquisition and long-term leasing mechanisms. </p><p>The significant expansion of the social housing build programme is evident in the Quarter 1 2018 Social Housing Construction Status Report.

The increased provision of PBSA was established as a key priority in addressing the current wider housing crisis. </p><p>My Department works closely with the Department of Education and Skills through the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Student Accommodation in examining the issue of student housing and potential policy measures to increase accommodation supply. This Group which includes stakeholders from the Higher Education Institutes, Union of Students in Ireland and other Government Departments highlighted important issues in developing new student accommodation projects, including the planning and development finance aspects in assembling new development projects.</p><p>The work of this Group led directly to the initiation of reforms in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 which provided for the fast-tracking of planning applications for student housing construction projects of greater than 200 bed-spaces to An Bord Plean&aacute;la (which commenced on 3 July 2017). In addition, the legislation provides for the availability of low-cost financing from the Housing Finance Agency to the Higher Education Institutes specifically for new student accommodation projects in order to support the delivery of new accommodation projects.</p><p>My Department has also assisted in the preparation of the National Student Accommodation Strategy<b></b>which was launched by the Department of Education and Skills in July 2017 &ndash; a specific action committed to under Rebuilding Ireland. This policy document was developed with input from the key stakeholders in the sector and includes eight key targets and 27 actions to support the delivery of an increased supply of purpose-built student accommodation. </p><p>These and other measures by my Department have assisted in delivering a significant increase in the level of purpose-built student accommodation projects coming forward nationally. </p><p>Recent analysis from the Higher Education Authority has indicated that, by May 2018, approximately 3,000 bedspaces had been delivered since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland and some further 7,250 bedspaces are currently under construction nationally. In addition, over 7,000 bedspaces have received planning permission but are yet to commence construction and a further 1,200 are seeking planning permission. The scale of this level of additional student accommodation should exert a downward pressure on the cost of such accommodation, through availability of supply and competition. </p><p>In tandem with measures to increase new accommodation supply, my Department has supported the initiative of the Minister for Finance in increasing the availability of student accommodation in private homes through the &quot;rent a room&quot; provisions whereby a tax exemption for the homeowner of up to &euro;14,000 per year can be availed of.</p><p>Since 2016, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, my Department has also provided funding to the Union of Students in Ireland for their &lsquo;Homes for Study&rsquo; campaign &ndash; this essentially funds a website and activities to match students with rooms in private houses through the following weblink:<i></i><i>. </i></p><p>My Department is therefore very keenly aware of the concerns raised over significant increases in the cost of student accommodation in certain student complexes and will continue to liaise with wider education-sector stakeholders through the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Student Accommodation under the chairship of the Department of Education and Skills.  For example, the Group will continue to examine the range of student accommodation types (and ancillary services), available with a view to considering how best to regulate pricing arrangements, including, if appropriate, new regulatory or legislative proposals which might be considered in the context of the forthcoming Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018.</p></reply>

A commitment to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes through a range of delivery mechanisms is being supported by a multi-annual Exchequer commitment totalling &euro;6.5 billion over the period of the plan. These targets will be achieved using a combination of building, purchasing and leasing high quality properties to meet the needs of households on local authority waiting lists around the country. </p>  <p>  Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, 10,000 will be leased by local authorities and approved housing bodies under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources. </p>  <p>  Data on social housing leasing, funded by my Department, in respect of all local authorities to end Q1 2018 is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.  Data in respect of Q2 2018 is currently being collated and will be available shortly.

Reviews usually take place every 3 to 4 years, and are adjusted upwards or downwards in line with the rent setting mechanism set out in the lease agreement. In most cases, rent reviews are linked to changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Harmonised Index of the Consumer Price Index (HICP). </p></reply>

This includes the implementation of planned maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs and pre-letting repairs. </p>  <p>  My Department supports local authorities in bringing vacant properties back to productive use by providing funding under the voids programme. The exchequer funding is additional to the support that local authorities provide themselves towards such work. Under this programme, local authorities can claim a maximum of &euro;30,000 funding per unit and there are no plans to change this limit.  The derelicts and 2 into 1 programmes require greater levels of remediation with associated higher costs, in excess of the limits as set out in the voids programme.  </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

In addition, the NPF represents a long-term strategy for Government Departments, State agencies, State-owned enterprises, local authorities and others to support communities to achieve their potential for economic, social and infrastructural development through a shared set of strategic objectives and key principles.</p><p>As a strategic document, the NPF is currently being given further and more detailed expression at the regional level through preparation, by the local government sector, of statutory Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES) for the three Regional Assembly areas.  The RSES process formally commenced earlier this year and draft Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies are currently in preparation for public consultation later in the Autumn.  The finalisation of these regional strategies in the first half of 2019 will in turn prompt reviews and updates of individual county and city development plans to ensure strategic co-ordination and consistency between national, regional and local levels.</p><p>To assist in the preparation of these important plans, my Department published the Implementation Roadmap for the National Planning Framework in July 2018.  Appendix 2 of this document provides details on transitional regional and county population projections for 2026 and 2031.  These projections take account of the fact that, cumulatively, current city and county plans are based on post-2006 population projections and provide for a quantum of significantly greater population growth than previously occurred and that also exceeds any likely scenario identified as part of the NPF/NDP preparation process.  The transitional regional and county population projections provided in the Roadmap set a growth trajectory approximately mid-way between what is currently proposed for in statutory development plans and a more evidence-based nationally coherent scenario to 2031 and 2040.</p><p>The Implementation Roadmap is available to view on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The RSES process, and the subsequent individual county/city development plan reviews, must address the growth of each region in accordance with the overall parameters set out in the NPF.  The transitional population projections provided in the Roadmap are part of these parameters.  The review process is intended to strengthen the settlement strategy within counties in light of more relevant and updated population projections whereby towns with capacity will be enabled to continue their logical planned growth within a coordinated county-wide strategy.</p><p>Regional and local decision-making at the appropriate level is also provided for through the approach above to shape how the development of all parts of the country, including County Wicklow, can be assured and guided through to 2040, including in the matter of ensuring that housing is provided at appropriate locations across the country and in line with infrastructural and service availability in place and planned for those places.</p></reply>

The review has incorporated analysis of comprehensive data received from local authorities regarding the operation of the scheme during 2016 and a wide-ranging public consultation process which took place in 2017 and saw submissions received from individuals, elected representatives and organisations.</p>  <p>  The review is now complete and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.</p>  <p>  In finalising the report some further consultation was necessary and due consideration had to be given to possible implementation arrangements.

Together with delivering much more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live as well as work.</p>  <p>  There are two pilot cost rental schemes currently being advanced; one at Enniskerry Road, in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, and the other one at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, Dublin 8.  It is expected that 50 affordable units and 100 social homes will be made available on the Enniskerry Road site.  It is estimated that the site at St. Michael's Estate will accommodate over 470 homes.  While the final tenure mix will be decided by Dublin City Council and informed by the detailed site development process, it will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided under cost rental.</p>  <p>  In relation to Enniskerry Road, it is anticipated that construction will commence in the first quarter of 2019.  With regard to St. Michael's Estate, Dublin City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to drive this key project.  In addition to pre-existing consultative arrangements, the City Council is also facilitating the establishment of a special Inchicore Regeneration Consultative Forum to focus directly on the development of this key project.</p>  <p>  Once these pilot projects have progressed further, it is my intention to roll out cost rental projects across other suitable sites.</p></reply>

Draft Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies are currently being prepared for public consultation later this Autumn.</p>  <p>  My Department recently issued Circular Letter FPS 04-2018 and the NPF Implementation Roadmap which provide guidance on the alignment of city and county development plans with the NPF.  The Roadmap referred to the advisability of pausing local authority development plan review processes that are under way to await the latest data and policy contexts set out in the RSES.  </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 includes provisions for the initiation of review of City/County Development Plans to be:</p>  <p>  1. Deferred on a once-off basis, where due to commence prior to or within a period of 3 months after the initial making of the relevant RSES, until not later than a period of 3 months after the relevant RSES has been made; or</p>  <p>  2. Temporarily suspended, where commenced and ongoing and where a draft plan has not been submitted to the members of the Planning Authority under Section 11(5)(a) of the Act, prior to the initial making of the relevant RSES in each case, until not later than a period of 3 months after the relevant RSES has been made.</p>  <p>  These provisions should ensure an efficient and effective process of alignment between all the levels of spatial planning in our planning process, from national to regional to local.  The Commencement Order, which is necessary for the formal commencement of these provisions, is being finalised by my Department, in conjunction with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to these provisions coming into effect imminently.</p>  <p>  The Circular and Implementation Framework are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:  https://www.housing.gov.ie/search/archived/current?query=Circular+FPS+04%2F2018.  </p></reply>

Planning authorities have issued notices to owners of vacant sites by 1 June this year in respect of vacant sites included on their respective registers on 1 January 2018, indicating that the levy will apply to those sites on 1 January 2019.  </p>  <p>  While all 31 local authorities have established vacant site registers, not all registers have been populated to date as some local authorities are undertaking the necessary preparatory work in this regard, i.e. identifying qualifying vacant sites, their registered owners and commissioning the market valuations of such sites.  As required under the Act, the planning authority must enter certain information on the register in relation to a vacant site, including name and address of owner, the folio reference, as appropriate, the market value together with the date of entry on the register.  </p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area.  As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website.  However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, there are collectively almost 290 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 160 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy in order to ensure a consistent application of the levy provisions across all city and county areas and to facilitate the sharing of best practice.  My Department has provided guidance and advice and also organised three separate information seminars for local authorities, most recently on 1 May 2018, which was attended by officials from every local authority.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.</p></reply>

There is a range of funding programmes available through local authorities to achieve this ambition, including relating to construction, acquisition and leasing activity.  AHBs and local authorities work in partnership locally across these delivery streams. </p>  <p>  A particular focus of acquisition related activity is targeting vacant properties and bringing them back into use for social housing.  In that context, a specific Fund has been established and the Housing Agency has been provided with &euro;70 m with the objective of acquiring some 1,600 units from banks and investment companies over the period to 2020 for social housing use.  Properties acquired by the Agency using this Fund are sold on to AHBs utilising the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) and the funds received will then be recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions. </p>  <p>  As at 31 August 2018, through the Housing Agency &euro;70 m Acquisitions Fund, bids by the Housing Agency have been accepted on 786 properties, 23 of which are being sold by private investment funds whose loan charges were previously under the control of NAMA.  Purchases have closed on 438 properties, two of which were sold by private investment funds whose loan charges were previously under the control of NAMA.  The total value of these 23 properties is &euro;5,703,800.  The purchase of two of the 23 properties was complete as of the end of August with the other 21 properties being progressed.  It is intended that these properties will be sold on to AHBs by the Housing Agency.  These properties were part of a larger portfolio offered by an investment fund and it was considered in the public interest to purchase these particular properties to support social housing objectives. </p></reply>

The administrative arrangement for paid sick leave for civil servants is set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Circular 05/2018: Arrangements for Paid Sick Leave, which is available on DPER&rsquo;s website <i>www.circulars.gov.ie.</i>The rationale for the Scheme is to provide support to public servants who became ill while at the same time reduce the very high and unsustainable cost of sick leave in the public service.  Although the new Scheme did reduce access to sick pay overall, it retained the previous access to sick pay for those public servants who suffer from a critical illness or injury.  </p><p>Where an individual is out on sick leave their record over the previous four years is examined to determine if they have access to paid sick leave.  This process is known as the &lsquo;look back&rsquo; and is set out in in the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No 124 of 2014).  </p><p>Under the scheme, sick leave is paid at full pay for three months (i.e. 92 days) and at half pay for three months (i.e. 91 days) annually, subject to an overall limit of 6 months (i.e. 183 days) paid sick leave (at either full or half pay) in any four year period.  In addition, there is provision for a longer period of sick leave to address a critical illness or serious physical injury under the Critical Illness Protocol (CIP).  Under CIP, an individual may have access to extended sick leave of 6 months on full pay in a rolling 1 year period, followed by 6 months on half pay, subject to a maximum of 12 months&rsquo; paid sick leave in a rolling 4 year period.  Under the protective year, if an individual returns to work following CIP, he or she may continue to avail of the remaining extended sick leave for subsequent illness or injury, critical or non-critical which occur within 12 months of the first date of absence due to critical illness/injury.  </p><p>If an individual has exhausted access to full or half pay they may access a further payment called Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR) subject to certain conditions.  It  provides that where an individual has received 365 days&rsquo; paid sick leave in a rolling 4 year period, he or she may be paid TRR for a maximum of 365 days (1 year).  TRR may be paid for a further period of 730 days (2 years) where it is a direct continuation of an illness under the Critical Illness Protocol.  The rate of TRR is based on pensionable service.
