My Department has been actively involved with the Military Authorities in the process of reviewing DFR R5. </p>  <p>  Completion of amendments to DFR R5 (governing the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve) and DFR S7 (matters relating to RDFRA) are interlinked. These Regulations encompass a broad range of matters from Finance, Human Resources, promotions and training to effectiveness criteria. Amendments are complex and time consuming and have required extensive internal consultation. A revised draft of DFR R5 is currently being finalised. Draft amendments to DFR S7 are also being finalised. </p>  <p>  I know that the Representative Association for members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve have a particular interest in this piece of work. I anticipate that they will be invited to provide their comments on the draft amendments in the near future, as part of the normal consultative process.  </p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role that the RDF plays in contributing to Ireland's defence capability. The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF and it is currently on a developmental path arising from the recommendations of the White Paper.  </p>  <p>  A key ongoing challenge for the RDF is to recruit and retain personnel. I am aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment, which provides for 4,069 personnel. Recruitment is ongoing and two recruitment campaigns were organised for the AR and the NSR this year, one in March and a second having recently closed on 20th October. Supports being provided to maximise recruitment to the RDF include the use of social media and outreach activities by RDF members. PDF recruit exit interviews now contain information on applying for membership of the RDF.  </p>  <p>  Engagement will continue between my Department and the with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RFDRA) on issues of interest to the members of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve.  </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the ongoing development of the RDF within the framework set out in the White Paper and having regard to resource availability.  It is my intention to ensure that momentum on its development is maintained. </p></reply>

This includes undertaking overseas Peace Support Operations, and in this regard to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops whilst on such missions. </p><p>The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces. Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), where appropriate, in line with the EU procurement Directives, including the Defence and Security Directive. </p><p>Such tender competitions are open to any company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargoes or restrictions. There are no such restrictions or embargoes in place on Israeli companies. </p><p>In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria. </p><p>I am advised that my Department has not purchased any weapons from Israel. However, defensive equipment has been acquired from Israeli companies by way of competitive tendering, the main procurements have been Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operated by the Defence Forces, Ground Surveillance Radar Equipment and an upgrade to the Army's existing Fire Control and Command Systems. The primary purpose of such equipment is to provide force protection for our Defence Force personnel whilst serving on overseas missions. </p><p>The value of defensive equipment procured from Israeli based firms and companies since 2010 is &euro;14.1 million, inclusive of VAT. Details for each of the years will are as follows: </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Expenditure, inclusive of VAT</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010</td>       <td>&euro;3,786,139.33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>&euro;298,530.08</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>&euro;272,925.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>&euro;374,213.24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>&euro;2,483,283.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>&euro;882,469.57</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;365,470.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;3,201,314.06</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;2,244,868.23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;148,155.52</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>&euro;14,057,422.03</td>    </tr> </table> <b></b></p><p>The matter of barring Israeli companies from entering tender competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo on such goods from Israel and this raises, inter alia, serious implications for Irish foreign policy which are outside my remit. </p><p>Trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level. </p><p>The manner in which the Department of Defence procures both goods and services remains consistent with international best practice and is in line with EU and UN decisions on trade embargoes. I am satisfied that this is the appropriate way in which to continue, rather than Ireland taking any unilateral decision to target individual companies or countries in that respect.</p></reply>

Whilst I am very much aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment. I remain committed to restoring the strength of the Defence Forces to 9,500 personnel as provided for in the White Paper on Defence (2015).  </p>  <p>  I am also fully aware of the specific HR challenges that relate to the Defence Forces and in this regard the manpower requirement is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. The 2019 recruitment campaign for the Defence Forces is ongoing with 528 new entrants having been inducted so far this year. The Defence Forces recruitment process is subject to continuous monitoring and appraisal to ensure that it remains fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  The Government has acknowledged that there are recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces that must be addressed. It is a fact that members of the Permanent Defence Force are being attracted to jobs elsewhere in a buoyant labour market.  In light of the particular difficulties being faced by the Defence Sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of recruitment and retention issues in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report, which has been accepted by Government, contains a broad range of recommendations which will provide immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements. Arrangements are being made to process the revised rates of certain Defence Forces allowances which include: </p>  <p>-  a 10% increase in Military Service Allowance </p>  <p>-  the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances</p>  <p>-  the restoration of Premium Rates for certain weekend duties.</p>  <p>-  the return of an incentive scheme to address pilot retention issues in the Air Corps. </p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that both RACO and PDFORRA have accepted these recommendations. </p>  <p>  The Report contains a range of recommendations aimed at improving work-force planning, recruitment and conditions of service. The Report also recommends for an examination of pay structures in the PDF and to identify further retention measures within the context of the Public Service Stability Agreement and future public sector pay negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Government has prepared a detailed implementation plan setting out the timelines and objectives, indicating the commitment to deliver on the Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.  Work on implementing the plan is underway and, under my direction, is being prioritised by Civil and Military Management.</p>  <p>  I am confident that all the measures contained in the plan, coupled with pay benefits being delivered by the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the most recent being a 1.5% increase on 1st September, will address recruitment and retention challenges being experienced by the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that as the Government's plan contains short, medium and long term measures, the full impact of these measures will take time to determine. There are also a range of external variables which impact on recruitment and retention and which can change. The capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake the tasks assigned by Government will continue to be carefully monitored having regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the Pay Commission and other actions which are underway.</p></reply>

This additional 12 month commitment has continued throughout 2019 to date as Ireland  assumed full duties and responsibilities of IRISHBATT up to November 2019.  Arrangements are in place with the United Nations for Poland to partner Ireland in UNIFIL from November 2019.   Ireland will reduce its contribution of troops in UNIFIL to 340 personnel approximately and Poland will provide some 220 personnel. Hungarian personnel will also deploy as part of the Polish contingent. </p>  <p>  Tensions between Hezbollah and Israel have and continue to be a constant in the region.  Appropriate force protection for our personnel is in place to address any heightened tension in the area of operations.  As with all missions, developments in the UNIFIL area of operations are kept under ongoing review. The security situation in Lebanon will continue to be monitored closely and any necessary adjustments to ensure the safety and security of personnel deployed in UNIFIL will be made as required. </p>  <p>  Given the views of the United Nations in relation to the importance of this mission in supporting peace and stability in the region, the continued presence of UNIFIL and Ireland's support to it, remains an important element in the response of the international community through the United Nations.  We will continue to support the mission in this regard. </p></reply>

This is particularly important given the nature of their role and personal access to firearms and weapons.</p>  <p>  Personnel currently have access to two in-house clinical psychologists, as well as external psychiatric services as required. The Deputy will be aware that efforts to recruit a full-time clinical psychiatrist for the Defence Forces are ongoing.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Defence Forces engages in extensive suicide awareness and mental health education programmes for all members through its Personnel Support Services (PSS).</p>  <p>  The PSS also makes confidential services, including critical incident stress management, and psychosocial support available to all Defence Forces personnel through its network of Barrack Personnel Support Service Officers and occupational social workers at formation, unit and barrack level.  </p>  <p>  As additional support, my Department has arranged the provision of a confidential counselling, referral and support service, on a wide range of personal and work related issues, for serving members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Civil Defence members.

It agreed to provide a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to participate in the Battlegroup which will be on standby for the second semester of 2020 from 1st July 2020.  The MoU on Ireland's participation in the German Battlegroup 2020 was also approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at the end of June this year.  </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces contribution to the German Battlegroup will involve a Special Operations Task Group comprising a Special Operations Forces Platoon, Engineer Special Search Capability, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Capability and a Security Platoon together with staff posts at both the Operational and Force Headquarters.  The total personnel involved will amount to about 150 if it deploys.  The role of the ARW within the Defence Forces contribution would normally involve tasks such as long-range reconnaissance and the gathering of intelligence.  </p>  <p>  At present, 10 members of the Permanent Defence Force have been deployed to positions in the Force Headquarters in Germany, which include some members of the Army Ranger Wing. These personnel are engaged in training and planning activities in connection with the Battlegroup, in advance of and during the Battlegroup standby period.  </p>  <p>  As part of Ireland's participation in this Battlegroup, it is planned that an off-island joint field training exercise of all the Battlegroup elements will take place in Germany 16th-27th March 2020.  To this end, it is planned that the main Defence Forces component will locate to Ulm in Germany to participate in exercise European Challenge for a limited period at that time. </p>  <p>  Battlegroups, as part of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, offer a stand-by military capability that enables the EU to react rapidly and decisively to a crisis situation.

While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement with the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will be a factor in future developments in the Defence sphere within the EU. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding Brexit, the UK will remain a significant security and defence actor in Europe with the potential to contribute to the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach to crisis management operations across both the civil and military domains.  The nature of that potential contribution to EU CSDP missions and operations and to initiatives such as PESCO, are being considered within the EU institutions and with the UK.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is positively disposed to the UK continuing to play an active role, as a 3rd country participant, in contributing to CSDP missions and operations and to adding value to PESCO projects when the rules governing 3rd country participation have been agreed.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for on-island security in Ireland rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate. </p></reply>

It is a fact that members of the Permanent Defence Force are being attracted to jobs elsewhere in a buoyant labour market. This is as a result of the high calibre of individuals in the Defence Forces and the skills they have acquired during their careers. The issue is more pronounced when these skills have been acquired in specialist fields. </p>  <p>  In light of the particular difficulties being faced by the Defence Sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of recruitment and retention issues in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report, which has been accepted by Government contains a broad range of recommendations which will provide immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force as well as initiatives that can lead to further improvements.

The Brexit Omnibus Act 2019, and the publication of the Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update last July, reflects the extensive work which has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis to prepare for a no deal Brexit.     </p>  <p>  Ireland's objectives for this stage of the Brexit process have been clear and consistent from the very beginning.  Recognising the unique situation on the island of Ireland, the revised draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland provides important safeguards that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected in all its parts, including avoiding a hard border, protecting North South cooperation and the all island economy.  It also protects the integrity of the EU's Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland's place in them.  The Agreement reached between the EU and the UK clearly achieves all of these objectives.  It remains the Government's view that ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement remains the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure an orderly withdrawal.</p>  <p>  In light of this, there are no plans to reopen Army Barracks in the Border region.  As I have said in the past, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.   </p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so.    </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

The primary aim of Ireland's Partnership for Peace participation is to enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the UN, EU or NATO.    </p>  <p>  Over the past 20 years, participation in Partnership for Peace has been fundamental to Ireland being able to keep abreast of developments in areas such as training, humanitarian aspects of peacekeeping and interoperability and enhances the ability of our peacekeepers to work alongside those of our partners.  It also enables us to share our own peacekeeping skills with a wide range of countries. Ireland&rsquo;s involvement has delivered significant improvements for our Defence Forces in terms of capability development and operational capacity. This has enabled us to make a positive impact, particularly in undertaking more demanding international crisis management operations.    </p>  <p>  As a result of NATO's recent reorganisation of its partnership structures, the responsibility for Partners in Partnership for Peace is being transferred from the Defence Policy and Planning Division to a newly formed directorate within an Operations Division. This new Directorate is called the Defence Institution and Capacity Building Directorate. </p>  <p>  It will involve all partnership programmes transferring to the new Directorate and that includes the Planning and Review Process, the Defence and related security Capacity Building initiative, Building Integrity, the Defence Education Enhancement Programme, the Professional Development Programme, and the Military Career Transition Programme.</p>  <p>  One of the purposes behind the consolidation of these programmes in a single staff structure, is to ensure greater coherence and coordination between the programmes and to ensure that the programmes are better aligned with the agreed objectives of the individual partnership relationships.  I am satisfied that Ireland will continue to benefit as we move to a new NATO organisation structure and as all Partners engage with the new Partnership Directorate.  I look forward to the opportunities that this will bring to further enhance capability development and modernise our defence forces.  </p></reply>

Retention of the Army's two brigade structure is among the commitments outlined in the White Paper.  The two-brigade Army structure along with certain barrack closures has seen the consolidation of understrength units into smaller numbers of full strength units, a reduction in the number of headquarters and the associated redeployment of personnel from administrative and support functions to operational units.

This includes immediate financial benefits in the form of: </p><p>- a 10% increase in Military Service Allowance (MSA), which, in itself, will boost the earnings of the majority of Permanent Defence Force personnel by between &euro;602 and &euro;675 per annum.</p><p>- the restoration to pre-Haddington Road Agreement levels of certain allowances specific to the Defence Forces including Security Duty Allowance and Patrol Duty Allowance.</p><p>- the restoration of Premium Rates for certain Weekend Duties.</p><p>- the re-establishment of a service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots.</p><p>I welcome the decision of both PDFORRA and RACO to accept these measures.</p><p>These measures, which will cost &euro;10 million per annum,  are in addition to the increases in pay which members of the Defence Forces are receiving under the Public Service Pay Agreement 2018-2020.</p><p>The Government has produced a detailed plan for the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Public Service Pay Commission. The plan provides for immediate actions as outlined previously, which are currently being implemented following their acceptance by the Representative Associations. The Plan also provides for further measures in the short, medium and longer term. A review of pay structures in the PDF will be undertaken as part of the more general exercise recommended by the PSPC in its 2018 Report. The identification of options to further incentivise long service arrangements for certain Officer and NCO ranks will also be progressed in the context of future pay negotiations. A range of other non-pay related actions are also being progressed.</p><p>As the actions being progressed have a range of timeframes, the full impact of the proposals will take time to determine. There are also a range of external variables which impact on recruitment and retention which remain dynamic. The capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake the tasks assigned by Government will continue to be carefully monitored having regard to the implementation of the full recommendations of the Pay Commission and other actions which are underway. </p></reply>

The Brexit Omnibus Act 2019, and the publication of the Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update last July, reflects the extensive work which has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis to prepare for a no deal Brexit.     </p>  <p>  Ireland's objectives for this stage of the Brexit process have been clear and consistent from the very beginning.  Recognising the unique situation on the island of Ireland, the revised draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland provides important safeguards that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected in all its parts, including avoiding a hard border, protecting North South cooperation and the all island economy.  It also protects the integrity of the EU's Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland's place in them.  The Agreement reached between the EU and the UK clearly achieves all of these objectives.  It remains the Government's view that ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement remains the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to ensure an orderly withdrawal.</p>  <p>  In light of this, there are no plans for the reinstatement of troops in the Border counties.  As I have said in the past, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.   </p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so.    </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

The responsibilities of the new Directorate in relation to space will be, first, to foster an innovative space industry in the EU and second, to implement the future Space Programme, which includes the European Global Navigation Satellite System (Galileo) and the European Earth Observation Programme (Copernicus). </p>  <p>  In relation to its Defence Industry responsibilities, it is expected that the new DG will administer the European Defence Fund.</p>  <p>  The European Defence Fund (EDF) is a financial mechanism designed to enable and accelerate cooperation among Member States to better coordinate national investments in defence. Through the co-funded EDF, it is expected that Member States will be able to achieve greater output and develop defence technology and equipment that may not be feasible on their own, by pooling national resources.  The fund will also foster innovation and allow economies of scale, which will enhance the competitiveness of the EU defence industry and deliver economies for individual member States . </p>  <p>  It is also expected that the new DG will have responsibility in ensuring that there is an open and competitive European defence equipment market and for enforcing EU procurement rules on defence. Under this new DG, Defence will be treated simply as another industrial sector of the European economy availing of EU sectoral oversight and supports.</p>  <p>   Ireland recognises that in order for us to have a well-equipped and capability driven Defence Forces, we require advanced equipment which incorporates the latest technology, alongside a more efficient and less fragmented industrial sector which can produce that equipment. This new DG will support this aim. In addition, we have to recognise that for certain Member States in the EU, defence is a significant contributor to their economies, representing an EU industry of &euro;100 billion with 1.5 million direct and indirect employees.  </p>  <p>  Ireland may not have a defence industry but there are opportunities for Ireland to access funding through companies in the dual-use product and technology sectors.   </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure that Irish interests, particularly in the area of opportunities for SMEs, are strongly represented in the work programmes of this DG.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the establishment of this new DG, I am satisfied that within the EU, defence and security will remain a national competence, including national spending on defence and security. </p></reply>

This significant level of funding emphasises the importance attached by this Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces are fully resourced to deliver on all the roles assigned to them by Government, both at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  The Defence allocation of &euro;780.4 million has increased by &euro;22.3 million on the 2019 provision and provides mainly for Defence Forces pay and allowances, standing and operational costs and capital expenditure in 2020. The allocation for pay and allowances includes provision for the target strength of 9,500 Permanent Defence Force (PDF) personnel and includes all outstanding Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 commitments. It also includes provision for increases in Permanent Defence Forces allowances arising from the Public Service Pay Commission&rsquo;s (PSPC) report on recruitment and retention issues in the PDF and implementation of the initial measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s associated implementation plan.</p>  <p>  The 2020 capital allocation will rise by &euro;7 million to &euro;113 million. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to continue a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper. </p>  <p>  The allocation for Vote 35 (Army Pensions) is &euro;259.1 million, an increase of &euro;10 million over 2019. This will ensure that sufficient funding is available within the Army Pensions Vote to meet the retirement benefits of some 12,640 ex-members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.</p>  <p>  The European Defence Fund (EDF) is a financial mechanism designed to enable and accelerate cooperation among Member States to better coordinate, supplement and amplify national investments in defence. Through the co-funded EDF, Member States will be able to achieve greater output and develop defence technology and equipment that may not be feasible on their own, by pooling national resources.  The Fund will also foster innovation and allow economies of scale, which will enhance the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. The Fund has two strands or windows, which are complementary - the Research Window and the Capability Window.</p>  <p>  From 2018 to 2020, the Commission has allocated &euro;590 million to the European Defence Fund from the EU budget, &euro;90 million to the Research Window and &euro;500 million to the Capability Window under European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP). Post 2020, it is proposed that the new EU Defence Fund will be financed from the EU budget. The level of funding proposed is &euro;13 billion but this will depend on the outcome of negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 which are currently underway.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s contributions towards the EDF and EDIDP are directly through the EU budget and therefore do not impact on the Defence Vote.</p>  <p>  PESCO is an EU programme where projects may be funded from EDIDP and the EDF.  Additional costs may arise in respect of participation in specific PESCO projects, similar to the case where the Defence Forces participate in EDA Projects. The projects where Ireland has confirmed our participation relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations. Costs associated with participation on these projects should they arise in the future would be incurred in the normal course and will therefore be met from within the Defence Vote. </p></reply>

In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, primary responsibility for responding to emergencies such as a natural disaster rests with three designated principal response agencies, namely, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the relevant Local Authority  and the Health Service Executive.  The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority and Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) roles.  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

Leadership Training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations. Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills. Career Training, and education, provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.</p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements. A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons set out to 2021. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice. Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners. Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces deliver military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards and engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances and for a variety of possible reasons, specific training needs may arise that  cannot be met in a timely fashion through the methods I have outlined previously. In such exceptional cases the Defence Forces explore and avail of all possible options to  ensure that potential training deficits are addressed to ensure continued operational effectiveness.  </p>  <p>  I remain committed to ensuring that the personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be trained to appropriate standards. </p></reply>

As such, the RDF undertakes training in preparation to assist the PDF when required. Training across the Defence Forces is constantly measured against best military and academic practice. Training procedures are constantly reviewed in order to ensure that the men and women of the Defence Forces are fully prepared to meet the challenges of the ever changing security environment.</p>  <p>  In the Army Reserve (AR), recruits undergo varied training in areas such as combat first aid, military law and tactical training. A major part of Recruit training is training in the use of the Steyr 5.56mm Assault Rifle. After recruit training is complete, personnel are then trained in the operation of basic radio communications, map reading, Nuclear, Biological &amp;amp; Chemical warfare defence and the Light Machine Gun. Each Corps also carries out specialist training in its particular field. For example, the Infantry and Cavalry Corps train in weapons and tactics and the Corps of Engineers train in engineering tasks, such as demolition, construction and mine warfare.</p>  <p>  With regard to RDF training for the current year, Subhead A.5 provides for a budget of &euro;2.15 million of which &euro;2.068 million is allocated for Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve. This allocation will provide seven days annual paid training for each effective member of the AR and Naval Service Reserve (NSR). The budget also provides for fourteen days paid training for all additional personnel recruited to the AR and NSR in 2019 along with career and specialist courses for selected members of the Reserve in line with Reserve priorities. This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training. </p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the voluntary nature of Reserve service and to maximise attendance of AR and NSR personnel, training continues to be organised both in and out of normal working hours, at weekends and during academic and traditional holiday periods.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that members of the AR and NSR are afforded the opportunity to avail of training and update their skills on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

The Operations Directorate in Defence Forces Headquarters manages the necessary cross-service coordination in responding to both emergency and security issues. These arrangements have proved effective in all emergencies encountered to date.</p>  <p>  With regard to security threats, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  </p>  <p>  There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies. Regular coordination and liaison meetings take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard, amongst other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE. It is also supporting the HSE in an emergency aeromedical support service operating primarily in the West of Ireland. In addition the Air Corps has a maritime surveillance function undertaken by its maritime patrol aircraft and both it and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations.</p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any security and other emergencies that may arise. Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities. The role of the Defence Forces in these situations is dependent on the nature of the incident and the type of assistance requested. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review. It is my priority as Minister with responsibility for Defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas. </p></reply>

In the absence of the prospect of a referendum in the near future, the Government has no immediate plans for specific preparations on this issue and there has been no structured examination by officials from my Department of the potential costs of a United Ireland. </p>  <p>  The holding of a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland. Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Secretary of State shall exercise this power "if at any time it appears likely ... that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."</p>  <p>  While the decision to hold such a poll in Northern Ireland rests with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Government does not believe it likely at present that such a border poll in the near future would result in a decision on the part of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland in favour of constitutional change. In these circumstances, it is the Government&rsquo;s clear view that such a poll would only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.</p>  <p>  The Government respects everyone&rsquo;s right on this island to make the case for the constitutional future they wish to see for Northern Ireland - whether nationalist, unionist or neither. The Good Friday Agreement - and the two sovereign Governments - explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both of these constitutional positions, which are deeply held. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s immediate priorities are to secure the functioning of the devolved power-sharing institutions and the North South Ministerial Council, which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, and to ensure the protection of the Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the Peace Process, in the context of the UK decision to exit the European Union under any scenario.</p></reply>

Most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm.  When a loan is sold, the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections continue to apply.  </p><p>Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA).</p><p>The Central Bank wrote to industry in August 2019 to set out its expectations of all firms in respect of loan sales, including the transfer of alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs). In order to ensure a culture where consumers&rsquo; best interests are protected, where a cooperating borrower is complying with the terms of an ARA and the loan is subsequently sold to another regulated entity, the new regulated entity cannot unilaterally change the ARA agreed between the borrower and the original lender. The new regulated entity should continue to honour an ARA until review, expiry or by agreement, as appropriate. This includes honouring timelines and terms and conditions for reviews of the ARA. In circumstances where the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed, any change to the ARA must comply with the CCMA and be appropriate, sustainable and proportionate to any change(s) in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances. </p><p>I wrote to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and An Taoiseach on 25 September 2019 in relation to a number of issues raised during a meeting of that Committee.  In my letter I stated that &quot;<i>where a co-operating borrower is complying with the terms of an ARA put in place, and the loan is subsequently sold to another regulated entity, </i><i><i>the new regulated entity cannot unilaterally change the loan contract as agreed between the borrower and the original lender.</i></i><i>In short, anything binding on the original lender is binding on the purchaser and it should continue to honour an ARA that&rsquo;s in place until review and/or expiry.  Any breach of contract would give rise to a liability to all the remedies available under contract law&quot;.  </i>I hope this clarifies the situation for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am further advised that Revenue&rsquo;s analysis of the 2018 VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) returns, showed that some 94,000 businesses traded with the UK in 2018. Of these 94,000 businesses, approx. 55,500 do not currently have an EORI number.

The Withdrawal Agreement endorsed by the European Council, will now require ratification by the European Parliament and the UK Parliament. Pending ratification of the deal, it is not possible to say if the outlook will be different to that set out in Budget 2020. The extension to the Brexit deadline, agreed on 28 October, means that there is likely to be some upside to the projections in Budget 2020. </p><p>The <i>Macroeconomic Outlook and Projections </i>published with Budget 2020 show that, compared to a no Brexit baseline, the level of GDP in Ireland 5 years after Brexit would be around 3.8 per cent lower in a no-deal Brexit scenario. Employment would be 2.1 per cent lower in a no-deal scenario, than would otherwise be the case. It is important to highlight that employment and output in Ireland are still forecast to continue growing &ndash; but at a slower pace than previously projected. </p><p>Trade is the main channel through which a disorderly UK exit would impact the Irish economy, with tariff and non-tariff barriers weighing on exports. A disorderly exit would also result in lower activity in the UK and elsewhere, further reducing the demand for Irish exports. The impact in the more traditional manufacturing sectors could be severe, especially if tariff and non-tariff measures on their UK-sourced intermediate inputs led to production shortages. In aggregate terms, export growth of less than one per cent is expected next year, a sharp slowdown from the projected 2019 outturn of around 10 per cent.</p><p>In 2017 my Department published a paper on trade exposures which shows that relative to other EU Member States, Irish exports are substantially more exposed to the UK in a number of goods sectors. The analysis reveals that eleven of the EU-27&rsquo;s top fifteen proportionally most exposed products to the UK are Irish exports. The top five most exposed sectors included the Irish Agri-food sub-sectors Cereals, Vegetables and Fruit, and Live Animal products. In services, Ireland is in the upper range of the most exposed EU Member States, particularly in Financial Services.</p><p>Since the referendum result in 2016, Brexit has been embedded in all of the Government&rsquo;s economic decision-making, and in the management of our economy. The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy, the 10-year National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland.</p><p>Maintaining the closest possible trading relationship between the EU and the UK is therefore one of the Government&rsquo;s key Brexit priorities. The Government will continue to work to improve the business environment &ndash; to make it more competitive, to assist exporters to diversify markets, and to provide better infrastructure. </p></reply>

This responsibility includes the negotiation of the relevant EU framework of Directives and Regulations, and their transposition into Irish law, including the Solvency II Directive and the Insurance Distributors Directive.  I, as Minister, have no role in day to day supervision of the insurance industry, as this is the responsibility of the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). Having said that, my Department monitors and advises on issues that arise with regard to the provision of insurance, including motor insurance, and the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) has been feeding into a number of important reforms for consumers in this regard, as the Deputy will be aware.   </p>  <p>  With regard to the day to day supervision of motor insurance companies, the CBI is responsible for the authorisation and supervision of these undertakings in Ireland.  The CBI has two specific mandates as regards insurance supervision. First, it is responsible for the prudential supervision of insurance companies authorised by the CBI. Second, it is responsible for the supervision of conduct of business in Ireland, also referred to as consumer protection. The CBI, like all European supervisory authorities, is explicitly prohibited from playing any role in the setting of premiums. It states therefore, that it does not have a role in relation to pricing considerations or competitiveness of the Irish insurance industry.  It also states that provided firms treat customers fairly, the price of policies is a commercial decision for each insurance firm.</p>  <p>  I am also advised that all motor insurance companies operating in Ireland, whether authorised by the Central Bank or a competent authority of another EU state, are subject to conduct of business supervision by the Central Bank of Ireland.  They must follow the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (CPC).  The Central Bank has advised that the CPC provides that a regulated entity must act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market, and must make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer.  A regulated entity must ensure that all information it provides to a consumer is clear, accurate, up to date, and written in plain English.  Key information must be brought to the attention of the consumer, and the method of presentation must not disguise, diminish or obscure important information. The Central Bank expects that companies&rsquo; practices are compliant with these principles and requirements.  This is relevant to there being an adequate procedure in place to protect consumers against being treated unfairly.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are also measures in the CBI's 2012 CPC that require all regulated financial services firms to have complaints handling procedures in place.  With regard to the practices mentioned by the Deputy in the question, if, a person feels that they have been unfairly treated by an insurance company, and after following the firm&rsquo;s complaints process, they are still not satisfied, they have the right to refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  This is a statutory independent body that mediates unresolved disputes/complaints with regulated financial services providers. The Central Bank does not investigate individual consumer complaints.</p>  <p>  Finally, with respect to empowering motor insurance consumers, I think it is important to also reference new measures introduced by the CBI on 1 November.  These arose from recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  These are designed to increase consumer engagement and pricing transparency, and are as follows:</p>  <p>  - For private motor insurance renewals, insurers will be required to provide the amount of the insurance premium paid in the previous year or, where any mid-term adjustments were made to the policy during the year, an annualised premium figure;</p>  <p>  - Insurers will be required to provide the total premium for each policy option available for the customer in the renewal notices/quotations (i.e., comprehensive; third party, fire and theft cover; third party only, if offered by the insurer; and,</p>  <p>  - The renewal notification period will be extended from 15 working days to 20 working days for all non-life insurance policies.</p>  <p>  I believe that each of these measures should assist consumers in making decisions at renewal time, including encouraging them to shop around and, if favourable to them, switch insurance provider. </p></reply>

It is important to note, however, that the regime does not preclude any employee from making an individual claim for a tax allowance in respect of employment-related expenses, where those expenses meet the statutory requirement for such an allowance. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that an FRE allowance amount is decided following engagement between Revenue and the relevant representative body for the particular group of employees who incur the same expense. The regime has developed incrementally over the last 40 to 50 years and currently incorporates 53 employment categories, broadly covering some 134 individual FRE allowance amounts - see list attached.  </p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that a breakdown of the cost of the relief and numbers of employees by reference to each employment classification in which the FRE regime currently operates is not readily available.  For 2017, however, the estimated number of taxpayer units who availed of FRE allowances was 606,570 with gross claims of &euro;163 million equating to a tax cost of some &euro;48 million.  Final figures for 2018 are not expected to be available until mid-2020, to allow for processing of the data from income tax returns and cross referencing across Revenue&rsquo;s operational systems.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, over the past 18 months, Revenue has been conducting a comprehensive review of the FRE allowance regime.  Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the FRE review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category of FRE allowance is being examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 TCA 1997.  </p><p>Having regard to the Deputy's questions and to the fact that we are coming closer to the date on which any changes on foot of the review are due to be implemented, I will write to Revenue and request a factual update on the issue.  I will also take the opportunity to enquire if Revenue can provide any further clarification on the numbers of employees by reference to each employment classification as well as the cost under each classification.  I will revert to the Deputy in the matter as soon as possible.</p><p>  ">Flat Rate</p></reply>

It recommended a number of actions to improve transparency in this area.  Amongst these, Recommendation 1 requires the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to consider the feasibility of collecting price information on the cost of insurance to businesses, and if it considers such an index feasible to make appropriate proposals.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the CSO submitted a draft report to the Department of Finance in December 2018 on the work undertaken on the feasibility study to date. It subsequently provided a final report to the CIWG in January 2019.  In this report, the CSO outlined the method that they would recommend for the compilation of a price index for public and employer liability insurance.  At that time, the CSO outlined that it would pilot this method.  Since then, the CSO has worked closely with a technology partner and its pilot project concluded at the end of September.  While I understand that the results of the pilot project are encouraging overall, a small number of issues were identified and are currently being examined by the CSO. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the CSO is an independent Office and it will ultimately be for the CSO to determine whether or not to proceed with such an index.  Having said that, it is my understanding that the CSO is planning to make a presentation to the CIWG in early December in relation to a recommendation on a path forward.  This should allow an opportunity for the views of the CIWG to be heard directly by the CSO. </p></reply>

Where a public servant in receipt of a public service pension takes up private sector employment there is no impact, in respect of abatement, on the public service pension.  </p><p>It is taken, therefore, that the Deputy is referring to the payment of supplementary pensions.</p><p>Officers who are not members of the Single Scheme and who pay Class A PRSI during their employment in the public service have their public service occupational pension integrated with the Social Welfare system i.e. account is taken of any social welfare pension payable to the individual in calculating the occupational pension payable to that individual.  Where an individual does not qualify for a social welfare pension or qualifies at less than the maximum rate of Contributory State Pension they may be entitled to the payment of a supplementary pension subject to meeting certain conditions.</p><p>In the case of Established Civil Servants who are not members of the Single Scheme those conditions are laid down in Circular 6/1995 &ndash; Revised Social Insurance Status and Conditions of Service of Certain Civil Servants.</p><p>In accordance with paragraph 3 of the Circular, the new rules apply to persons appointed to established civil service positions on or after 6 April 1995.  The revised superannuation arrangements are set out at paragraph 13, which provides that:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot; ... In the case of officers covered by Class A insurance, the following arrangements will apply:  	 <blockquote> 	(a)no change will be made in the occupational lump sum; and<br /><br />(b)the occupational pension will be calculated on the basis of 1/80th of net pensionable remuneration per year service.  (Net pensionable remuneration means the amount by which pensionable remuneration exceeds twice the annual rate of social insurance old age contributory pension payable at the maximum rate to a person with no adult dependent or qualified children.)  In the case of staff to whom the terms of the Superannuation (Prison Officers) Act, 1919 apply, the pension benefit for each year of service in excess of twenty will be 2/80ths of net pensionable remuneration. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>Paragraph 18 of the Circular provides for payment of a supplementary pension as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;18. The revised superannuation arrangements include provisions for the payment of a supplementary pension in certain circumstances to pensioners in respect of periods during which the pensioner is not employed in any capacity which involves a social insurance contribution and, due to causes outside his/her own control, fails to qualify for social insurance benefitor qualifies for such benefit at less than the maximum personal rate. The supplementary pension will be equal to the difference between  	(i) the occupational pension which would have been payable if it had been based on pensionable remuneration instead of net pensionable remuneration and  <br /><br />(ii) aggregate of the actual occupational pension payable and the actual rate of social insurance benefit payable (including any payments for dependents).&quot;  </blockquote>  <p>It is understood that similar rules apply across the wider public service.  </p><p>The grant of a supplementary pension under paragraph 18 of the Circular is not automatic and is conditional upon a number conditions as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  the individual must not be engaged in paid employment;<br /><br />2.  he or she does not qualify for social insurance benefit or fail to qualify for such benefit at the maximum rate; and <br /><br />3.  his or her failure to qualify must be due to causes outside his or her control.   </blockquote>  <p>The maximum supplementary pension payable to an individual is equivalent to the current rate of the contributory state pension.  The actual rate of supplementary pension is dependent on many factors including length of service and final pensionable remuneration; this rate will not necessarily represent &ldquo;half of the pension&rdquo;.</p><p>Social Welfare Benefit is defined in the Rules as State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Transition); Illness Benefit, Invalidity Pension or Jobseekers Benefit payable under the Social Welfare Acts or any equivalent contributory benefit, by whatever name called, substituted for any of those benefits in any future enactment amending the Social Welfare Acts.  </p></reply>

These include:</p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value)</p>  <p>  - Contracting  authorities  are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots</p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate   in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale</p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal</p>  <p>  In addition, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, in accordance with the Programme for Government. This ensures that the voice of Irish SMEs (through the industry representative bodies ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland and CIF) is heard by Government. The Tender Advisory Service, which was re-launched in 2018, was set-up to assist SMEs with public procurement issues.  This service is an initiative that was developed out of the SME Advisory Group.</p>  <p>  The OGP proactively engages with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Inter-Trade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to promote SME access to public procurement. The OGP participate at Go-2-Tender workshops and Meet the Buyer events held across the country which are designed to help SMEs.</p>  <p>  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has worked with Enterprise Ireland to ensure we have the appropriate mix of supports for businesses to prepare and manage through whatever Brexit we may face over the coming period. The joint Skillnet and Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs Scheme was launched on 7th August to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses deal with additional customs requirements.   This is a free customs training programme delivered nationwide by Skillnet coupled with &euro;3 million funding allocated to Enterprise Ireland for a support payment of up to &euro;6,000 per employee to help with extra costs to manage customs compliance.</p>  <p>  The large suite of supports available also include the Brexit Scorecard, Grant aid, Consultancy, Mentoring, Advisory Clinics, Agile Innovation Fund, Operational Excellence Offer and Market Discovery Fund. These supports help companies consider various risks such as supply chain vulnerabilities and act to mitigate against them. All of these supports are critical for businesses and exporters who are heavily exposed to the UK market in sectors such as construction, engineering and food. </p>  <p>  The OGP has requested that industry representative bodies on the SME Advisory Group bring these support initiatives to the attention of their members.</p></reply>

Donegal is open to visitors daily throughout the year (opening times vary seasonally).  A public carpark, owned by Donegal Co. Council, is available during opening hours and this gives visitors direct access to a universally accessible boardwalk leading to the Monument itself a short distance away.  Basic interpretation is provided in the form of information panels located conveniently at the site.  OPW employs a local caretaker / keyholder to manage the opening and closing of the carpark and maintains visitor data electronically at the site.  The data available indicates that 90,435 visitors were recorded in 2018.  This level of usage by the public suggests that there is considerable interest in An Grian&aacute;n as an attraction and it is popular with both domestic and foreign visitors. However, it is also clear that the volume of footfall and the unregulated and unsupervised nature of the traffic presents significant conservation risks at the site.  Currently, OPW staff are being called on regularly during the summer period in particular to repair physical damage done to the Monument and to clean the site from the after effects of antisocial behaviour.</p>  <p>  Understanding that the site exhibits considerable tourism potential, OPW has raised with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht the possibility of some level of visitor infrastructure being provided which would enhance the experience and provide a control mechanism that would assist in the sustainable management of visitors. OPW has also met with interested parties locally, including Donegal Co. Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland and has suggested that collaboration between the various public agencies that focusses particularly on those that own potential development land near the Monument should be explored.   </p>  <p>  In order to assist with the process of identifying possible ways to improving provision for visitors to the site, OPW early in 2019 commissioned a specialist consultant to develop a Conservation and Management Plan for Grian&aacute;n an Aileach and this work is currently underway.  The OPW has, in the context of the discussions held with public partners, left open the question of the future management and staffing of the site.  Without suitable infrastructure currently, there is no suitable location to house staff and to provide a Guide service would not be feasible in advance of any facilities being built and a decision made as to who should operate the facility.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise therefore if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of the student, the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, that these should be raised by his parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he is attending, with a view to that Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels. Nationally, 167 new special classes opened for the 2019/20 school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.

This includes identifying the need for and establishing special class placements in various geographical areas where they are required. The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p>  <p>  Before approaching a particular school to request the establishment of a special class, the NCSE take into account both present and future potential need within the area and must be satisfied that the class is sustainable and appropriately located.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is continuing its work at local level to ensure all children can access a suitable school placement for the forthcoming school year and beyond. </p>  <p>  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to the NCSE planning for special class provision in a particular school area I have arranged for the question to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities. </p>  <p>  In that regard, I would recall that the Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment for a review of Garda districts and dispersement of resources. The resulting report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate entitled &ldquo;Policing with Local Communities&rdquo;, was submitted to me as Minister by the Policing Authority and published in December 2018.  That Inspectorate Report also finds that the responsibility for decisions on boundaries and dispersement of Garda resources &ndash; including the number, type and location of Garda stations - should rest with the Garda Commissioner, as is currently the case.  </p>  <p>  I consulted with the Garda authorities on the matter raised by the Deputy.  I understand from the Garda authorities that Castletroy, the area referred to by the Deputy, is located on the N7 Limerick &ndash; Dublin road and that there are three existing Garda stations between 5 and 10 kilometres away, namely Henry Street Garda station, Roxboro Road Garda station and Castleconnell Garda station.  I am further informed that a Garda Clinic is run on campus at the University of Limerick by Community Policing members based in the Henry Street District, to cater for student requirements and that this is currently held 3  times a month.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Garda authorities inform me that crime in the Castletroy and Annacotty area is stable. </p>  <p>  In these circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that development of a new station in the location referred to by the Deputy is not proposed by Garda&iacute;  at the present time.  </p>  <p>  I would also point out that Garda numbers are increasing - we now have over 14,200 Garda members supported by over 2,800 Garda staff. </p>  <p>  And the resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached record levels. The allocation made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2019 of &euro;1.76 billion. I am also pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's budget for 2020 to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year.</p>  <p>  Very significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a total of &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021. &euro;10 million capital funding has been made for the purchase and fit-out of Garda vehicles in 2019.  I understand from the Garda authorities that this allocation is  being used for purchase and fit-out of over 300 new vehicles for operational use this year. A further &euro;9 million capital funding has been allocated for the Garda fleet in Budget 2020. </p>  <p>  This continuing investment is intended to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive in all communities nationwide, including in the areas of Limerick referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

I expect that interim report will set out the expected time-frame for completion of the scoping exercise that he has been charged with. </p>  <p>  Judge Haughton is free to make any recommendation he sees fit, including the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry.  Finally, should he consider it necessary to recommend an inquiry, of whatever type, I have asked Judge Haughton to provide me with draft terms of reference for that process.</p>  <p>  In establishing the scoping exercise and in determining its terms of reference, I was guided by legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  While the most recent advice available to my Department recommended focused and specific terms of reference to take account of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in the Shatter v Guerin case, it is important to say that there is no impediment on Judge Haughton to make any recommendation he sees fit in relation to any future inquiry.  </p>  <p>  While I regret that this process has taken some time, the Deputy will appreciate the importance of ensuring that the scoping exercise was framed and conducted in accordance with the law.</p>  <p>  I urge all those concerned to engage fully with Judge Haughton and to input to his important work.</p></reply>

The matter remains before the courts, with the Court of Appeal reserving judgement, and is therefore sub-judice. The outcome of the appeal will have a bearing on whether or not legislation is required. Should it be necessary, I intend to introduce a Bill in the Oireachtas as soon as possible this term.</p>  <p>  My Department is doing everything possible to put a solution in place on an urgent basis. At the end of July, I obtained Cabinet approval for a proposed Bill to address the matter and intensive work is taking place in the Department where officials are working with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to finalise the draft Bill.</p>  <p>  As soon as the legal issues are resolved, my Department will make all necessary arrangements for the next Citizenship Ceremony. Invitations will issue four weeks in advance of the ceremony to ensure everyone has adequate notice.</p>  <p>  The advice to those who are planning to apply for citizenship is to continue to collect all of the necessary proofs that support their application and to submit a comprehensive application form. Once a solution is in place, if any additional information is required, applicants will be contacted as part of the processing of their application.</p>  <p>  The ruling is not considered to have consequences for anyone who has already obtained citizenship under the Act.</p></reply>

I meet regularly in that forum with some of the key stakeholders in the field of transport, including the Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Road Safety Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health and Safety Authority, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, the Department of Health, the City and County Managers' Association and the Attorney General. </p>  <p>  However in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy, I would point out that the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for managing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the allocation of Garda resources, in light of identified operational demands. This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel across the various Garda Divisions.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters. </p>  <p>  In terms of contact by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with Irish Rail or other transport operators - I am advised by Garda management that it engages extensively with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations.  I am further informed that there is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV helps provide assistance to Garda&iacute; when investigating such incidents.</p>  <p>  In terms of safety on public transport generally, I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Twin Track is a Community Engagement &amp;amp; Rail Safety Policing Initiative conducted in partnership between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other Public Transportation stakeholders such as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, DART Services, and Transdev [Luas]. </p>  <p>  Its purpose is to provide High Visibility Policing of Rail and light Rail transport within the DMR region and nationwide and to deliver crime prevention advice.

I am also pleased to have secured an additional &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's budget to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year.  The Commissioner is responsible for the efficient use of these resources and I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of these resources under continual review, to ensure their optimum use.</p></reply>

This includes a mix of large multinationals, start-ups, and high growth SMEs, including over 100 Enterprise Ireland supported Irish owned companies.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a highly skilled workforce that has achieved critical mass. There are approximately 30,000 people in direct employment in the sector, of which over 60% hold a third level qualification. The sector employs approximately 25% of all PhD graduates currently employed in Irish industry.  </p>  <p>  Biopharmaceuticals are the single largest exporting sector of goods from Ireland, valued at &euro;73bn in 2018, which represents a 32% increase on the 2017 figure. This comprised exports of organic chemicals of &euro;27bn and medical and pharmaceutical products of &euro;46bn. In 2018 35% of exports in this sector were to the US.</p>  <p>  The global top 10 biopharmaceutical companies have a manufacturing presence in Ireland and major investments from these companies has facilitated the rapid growth of the industry. The indigenous sector is highly innovative, also, with Irish companies competing successfully in global markets throughout the world. Consequently, Ireland is well positioned to be a leader in Pharma 4.0 supported by investments such as the Science Foundation Ireland pharmaceutical research centre (SSPC), the IDA Ireland-funded National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) and Enterprise Ireland's Irish Manufacturing Research (IMR) Technology Centre.</p>  <p>   38,000 people are employed in 350medtech companies in Ireland, nearly one in five of whom are employed by domestic companies. Four out of five are SMEs or start-ups and 60% of these companies are Irish. These companies are major drivers of innovation and are a vital part of the medtech ecosystem. </p>  <p>  14 of the world&rsquo;s top 15 leading medtech multinationals now have operations in Ireland and many have multiple sites.  Ireland is among the top destinations of choice for medtech investments into Europe. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s medtech sector has become one of the leading producers of medical device products globally and is one of the largest exporters of medtech products in Europe with annual exports by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland supported companies of &euro;12.6 bn to over100 countries worldwide. Of this &euro;12.6 bn, &euro;4.5 bn accounts for exports to the US.</p>  <p>  Central to the success of both Irish and foreign owned biopharmaceutical and medtech companies based here has been their R&amp;D capabilities, technical expertise, leadership and management strengths and collaborative partnerships.</p>  <p>  Trade and investment policy shifts in the US and international tax developments intensify the need for us to continuously strengthen our competitive advantage for biopharma and medtech investment and to remain a location of choice for innovation and manufacturing. </p>  <p>  At the same time, IDA Ireland works closely with its client base to support their ongoing presence in Ireland.  This includes engaging with client companies to help them address potential risks they may face whether related to the international trading environment or otherwise. The agency also provides financial incentives to carry out in-house R&amp;D projects and collaborative projects with third-level institutes and industrial partners for the purpose of enabling client companies to become more innovative, assists client companies to increase their capacity and capability to deliver to new and existing markets and supports client companies to replace old equipment with new technology upgrades. These supports are designed to develop the competitive capabilities of companies already located in Ireland and to help clients increase their capacity and capability to deliver to new and existing markets.</p></reply>

My Department's focus is on helping firms to improve their competitiveness and innovation, and to diversify markets.  </p><p>The suite of enterprise and finance supports now in place covers the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.</p><p>Since 2016, my Department and its agencies have worked to prepare Irish businesses for the potential challenges posed by Brexit by helping them to assess their preparedness and helping them to implement practical action plans in areas such as customs, supply chain and sourcing, and financial management. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s suite of Brexit supports includes preparedness vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets and innovation supports through Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland. Supports and advice are also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and F&aacute;ilte Ireland. </p><p>The most immediate consequences of a hard Brexit are likely to be currency movements, supply chain constraints, delays, duties and tariffs. In the first instance, there will be a strain on the working capital position of businesses.</p><p>Of my Department's suite of supports, the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme is designed to address working capital challenges brought about by Brexit. Under the Scheme, loans of up to &euro;1.5 million are available at a rate of 4% or less, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available on an unsecured basis. By contrast, the &euro;300m Future Growth Loan Scheme is designed to support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. </p><p>InterTradeIreland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 5,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. </p><p>ITI offers Brexit Planning Voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. </p><p>ITI Brexit Planning Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p><p>In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit. The online &ldquo;Bitesize Brexit&rdquo; resource is a one-stop-shop for cross-border traders, presenting information in easily digestible segments and includes specific actions businesses should take in preparing for Brexit.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland also recently launched 12 &lsquo;Brexit Essential&rsquo; questions aimed at helping exporting businesses further prepare and take action ahead of the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  The Brexit Essentials campaign highlights the key questions and documentation that businesses need to address in order to trade successfully with the UK post 31 October.</p><p>My Department, in association with the Department of Education and Skills and key industry partners, also launched a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The new initiative called Clear Customs comprises of a training programme and a customs financial support to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning new staff to customs roles.</p><p>In addition, the Government has held over 100 Brexit information seminars and events since last September. I also have been convening regular roundtable discussions with the main retail grocery and distribution players since December to better understand contingency planning within the sector on food supply. Revenue, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Dublin Port and relevant Government Departments also attend these meetings.</p><p>With the deadline for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU having now shifted to 31 January, the continued uncertainty around Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland. I want businesses, particularly those most impacted by Brexit, to know my Department and its agencies are here to help. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Uptake at 25 October 2019 (except where otherwise noted)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td>       <td>878 applications received, 787 approved by SBCI, 209 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;46.09 million.Of the approved applications to date, 158 were reapplications as eligibility expires after four months.(Uptake as of 1 November)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Future Growth Loan Scheme</td>       <td>1,814 applications received, 1,724 approved by SBCI, 431 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;75.07 million.(Uptake as of 1 November)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit </td>       <td>6,890 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 1,725 LEO   clients have completed the scorecard.</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td>       <td>223 Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new markets</td>       <td>211 companies have been approved under this initiative</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Prepare to Export Scorecard</td>       <td>5,182 Prepare to Export Scorecards have been completed</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Customs Insights Online Course</td>       <td>1,900 Customs Insights Course participants</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td>       <td>63 Agile Innovation projects have been approved</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td>       <td>16 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over 1,200 in attendance</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of   a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td>       <td>293 &ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland   Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td>       <td>1,091 Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs Grant</td>       <td>222 applications have been made to access financial support through   the scheme</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities</td>       <td>793 clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration   between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td>       <td>445 LEO clients have participated in the programme </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td>       <td>1,177 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars/Events </td>       <td>5,985 Participants at the Brexit Information events  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Customs Training Participants</td>       <td>1,347 Participants attended Customs Training</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service</td>       <td>5,316 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.

The deadline for withdrawal has now shifted to 31 January, but there remains an urgent need for Irish businesses to plan, prepare and take action to mitigate their exposure to Brexit, despite the continued uncertainty. </p>  <p>  My Department's ongoing engagement with businesses indicates that the proportion of businesses preparing for Brexit is increasing, particularly among those businesses identified as most exposed to Brexit-related impacts, and that awareness of the key Brexit challenges is also increasing. Almost 60% of Irish SMEs report a good understanding of the likely implications of Brexit impacts that are relevant to their business. The findings of our latest research suggest that planning for Brexit is increasing with almost 50% of SMEs taking some form of active engagement (up from 42% in 2018) in the form of planning or any other mitigating steps. Among the most impacted businesses, progress is also being made, for example more than half of exporters indicate that they have a Brexit plan. Among Enterprise Ireland clients, 85% have taken action in respect of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s suite of Brexit supports includes preparedness vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets and innovation supports through Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland. Supports and advice are also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  The network of 31 LEOs is there to support businesses in preparing for Brexit, to ensure that businesses are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. The LEOs have organised and contributed to various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. These are in addition to Enterprise Ireland's series of Brexit Advisory Clinics.</p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. Further to this, ITI offers Brexit Planning Voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.

However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses, and I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help them as they prepare for those changes.</p></reply>

We continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness and analyse the factors that are crucial to attracting further investments in the country.</p>  <p>  The World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2019 report compares the &lsquo;ease of doing&rsquo; business across 190 economies using quantitative indicators. The report assesses the impact of 10 areas of business regulation: starting a business; dealing with construction permits; getting electricity; registering property; getting credit; protecting minority investors; paying taxes; trading across borders; enforcing contracts; and, resolving insolvency.</p>  <p>  In the latest report, Ireland is ranked 24th globally (and 6th in the euro area). While these rankings represent a fall of one place from the previous year, the World Bank report also suggests that Ireland has become a better place to do business in the past 12 months, as Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;doing business&rsquo; score improved. The primary reason Ireland fell one place in these rankings was because other countries improved relatively more than Ireland over the past year.</p>  <p>  However, as competitiveness is a broad term, it is important to look at a range of indicators to ensure we have a holistic view of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. My Department considers a range of competitiveness indicators, including: (i) two other international competitiveness rankings - the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook (where Ireland is ranked 7th globally), and the WEF Global Competitiveness Report (24th). My Department also consider hard indicators such as the Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI) and Unit Labour Costs, which both suggest that Ireland is becoming more competitive. </p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s performance in these, and a wider selection of indicators, my view (and one shared by the National Competitiveness Council) is that Ireland remains a competitive economy. </p>  <p>  However, the fall in the World Bank rankings underline the fact that there is no room for complacency. The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) will issue recommendations on the actions needed to improve competitiveness in its forthcoming Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2019 report before the end of the year.  These recommendations will be brought to the attention of Government and responded to in due course.</p></reply>

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme. </p><p>The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p><p>Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.  </p><p>As at 1 November, the SBCI had received 878 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 787 have so far been approved, with 20 applications deemed ineligible and 71 pending processing. To date, 209 applications have progressed to sanction at bank level. However, it should be noted that 158 of the total applications under the scheme are re-applications. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the reason for re-applications was that eligibility codes had expired. </p><p>Given that businesses have applied for eligibility under the scheme more than once, and that other applicants are still within the eligibility window, it is not possible to say definitively what number of applicants have received approval but not proceeded with their application within the eligibility window.</p><p>The lifespan of eligibility codes under the Brexit Loan Scheme has now been extended from four to six months. <table>    <tr>       <th>Applications for Eligibility as at 1st November 2019</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Approved</td>       <td>787</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ineligible</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pending</td>       <td>71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Received </td>       <td>878</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Of which re-applications</td>       <td>158</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total progressed to sanction</td>       <td>209</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total value sanctioned</td>       <td>&euro;46,099,300</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The global top ten biopharmaceutical companies each now have a manufacturing presence in Ireland. Indigenous firms are also highly innovative and are competing successfully in global markets.</p>  <p>  Ireland's strong international reputation in pharmaceutical manufacturing has been hard-earned. It is the product of a long track record as a successful home to pharma firms, an effective regulatory framework and the high esteem in which the industry's highly qualified workforce here is held. Another key consideration has been the continued quality and safety of medicines manufactured here and the important role that the Health Products Regulatory Authority has played in this context. </p>  <p>  Patent protection for medicinal products in the EU and in Ireland remains amongst the most robust in the world. That protection is underpinned by international treaties, EU regulations and national legislation. This has contributed to Ireland's ability to attract investments of scale in pharmaceutical manufacturing.</p>  <p>  The time-scale of patents is an important consideration for companies in the biopharmaceutical sector. However, I understand those same firms consider a range of other issues when making commercial decisions on their long-term presence or growth plans in a jurisdiction. The IDA continues to work closely with all its clients in this area to better understand how these various factors, including those related to patent-expiry, could impact on their operations in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted as well that the industry itself is responding to challenges associated with patent expiry through the development of innovative new treatments and products. Ireland continues to win new innovative investments in small and large molecule manufacture and the evolving area of cell and gene therapies. This is a result of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement with its clients on all aspects of the industry, with a view to generating new employment opportunities and consolidating Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector.</p></reply>

Reporting rates may also be stimulated by promotion and publicity about a medicine.  The number of reports received should not be used as a basis for determining the incidence of reactions/events as neither the total number of reactions/events occurring nor the number of patients using a medicine is known.  Numerical comparisons should not be made between reactions/events associated with different medicines as comparisons may be misleading because of the limitations of the data.</p>  <p>  The level of reporting of suspected adverse reactions/events associated with Gardasil vaccines is indicative of the positive response to calls for reporting of national experience associated with use of the vaccine following its introduction into the national immunisation programme in May 2010.  According to the HPRA the extensive media coverage that vaccines have received in recent years has raised awareness of the need to report suspected adverse reactions/events associated with vaccination, thereby contributing in part to the volume of reports received.</p>  <p>  The majority of reports received by the HPRA for Gardasil have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse reactions/events for this vaccine, as described in the approved product information (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL)).  The SmPC and PL are issued when a medicine is first licensed for use and are reviewed and updated as necessary throughout the lifetime of the medicine.  The SmPC is mainly intended for use by healthcare professionals and includes detailed information on the use, dosing recommendations, precautions for use and the known side-effects of the medicine concerned.  SmPCs for all products currently authorised in Ireland are accessible from the HPRA website.  The package leaflet (PL) reflects the more comprehensive information described in the SmPC but is required to be presented in an abbreviated and easy-to-read format for patients.  Copies of the SmPC and PL for Gardasil are accessible via the HPRA website.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that reports submitted to the HPRA concern &lsquo;suspected&rsquo; adverse reactions/events.  This means that the effects experienced may represent side effects associated with the vaccine/vaccination process, or may be coincidental in terms of timing, due to an underlying or previously undiagnosed condition that would have occurred in the absence of vaccination.</p></reply>

Bord na gCon (BnG) is a body corporate and a separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p><p>In August 2019, BnG announced the establishment of a separate Care Fund dedicated to funding a variety of initiatives for the care and welfare of the greyhound, including:</p><p>- Various rehoming initiatives in conjunction with the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust (IRGT), established and operated by BnG, which assisted in the rehoming of over 1,000 greyhounds in 2018, including:</p><p>- An increase in financial support to private rehoming agencies for the rehoming of retired racing greyhounds in Ireland. Rehoming agencies will now be offered an additional &euro;100 per retired greyhound rehomed in Ireland to encourage and further facilitate domestic rehomings. This support assists with the veterinary costs involved in preparing a retired greyhound for rehoming.</p><p>- A partnership initiative is at an advanced stage of discussion between the IRGT and Greyhound Pets of America (GPA). It is expected that on successful conclusion of these negotiations, some 300 retired Irish greyhounds will be rehomed in the US in the first year of the arrangement alone. An initial transportation to Boston took place during September 2019, with the Atlanta branch of the GPA taking seven greyhounds during October 2019.  Work is underway to build the initiative with further branches.</p><p>- The provision and upkeep of &lsquo;greyhound care centres&rsquo;, which are intended to help the transition of racing greyhounds from the track to retirement. BnG is currently considering some 16 tender submissions.</p><p>- The &ldquo;Injuries at Tracks Recovery Scheme&rdquo;, open to all owners and trainers who have incurred veterinary costs in the treatment of greyhounds to repair a career-ending orthopaedic (bone) injury sustained at a BnG licensed stadium.</p><p>- A racing greyhound traceability system as provided for in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019. When implemented, it will allow the whereabouts of a racing greyhound to be monitored by BnG throughout its life stages. A tender process is expected to commence within the next two weeks.</p><p>Funding for the Care Fund is accrued from the following sources:</p><p>- 50% of all existing sponsorships.  Bord na gCon has undertaken to continue to match existing prize money structures on existing sponsorships.</p><p>- 10% of all admissions</p><p>- 10% of all restaurant packages</p><p>- 5% of net tote profits</p><p>In preparing its budget for 2020, Bord na gCon has estimated that a sum of &euro;750,000 will be generated for the Care Fund.  This combined with the funding generated in the latter part of 2019 will ensure a dedicated fund in excess of &euro;1 million for care and welfare initiatives.  </p></reply>

I have previously stated that I am open to working with the new delivery model, and I welcome the move to a more strategic, performance-based approach.  However, this new framework must be based on a system which achieves simplification for all.   </p>  <p>  I also firmly support the principle that there must be a high level of environmental ambition in the CAP post-2020, and I believe that the economic development of the agri-food sector goes hand-in-hand with the need for environmental sustainability. However, it is essential that the proposed new environmental conditionality is implemented effectively, with common standards that are relevant and effective. It is also important that the overall level of the budget acknowledges the public goods being delivered by farmers. </p>  <p>  Negotiations on the MFF proposals are running in parallel to the CAP post-2020 negotiations. Agreement requires unanimity at the EU Council and it is important to note that funding for the CAP is outside the remit of Agriculture Ministers. There are diverging views amongst Member States on the appropriate level for the budget, and further discussion is required before agreement can be achieved.   </p>  <p>  In this context, I have been working with my European counterparts to raise awareness and build consensus around maintaining a strong CAP budget post 2020:-</p>  <p>  - In May 2018, I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid, calling for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post-2020.  The memorandum has been supported by up to 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers.</p>  <p>  - I have consistently called for an adequate CAP budget to meet the increasing demands being placed on farmers, particularly in achieving greater climate ambition.  I have held multiple bilateral meetings with my European colleagues and have also raised the matter on several occasions with Commissioner Hogan.</p>  <p>  - At the most recent Agri-fish Council in October, I joined with 16 Ministers from a number of EU Member States to reiterate the call for the CAP budget to be maintained post-2020, to meet the new challenges faced by European agriculture. </p>  <p>  I also called for the urgent consideration of transitional measures as I consider that there is an obligation to provide a smooth path between the current CAP and the new CAP.  I am pleased to see that the Commission has very recently published their proposals for transitional measures, and my Department officials are currently analysing the details with a view to feeding into upcoming discussions.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my European counterparts to ensure the best possible outcome for Irish farmers from the CAP post-2020 negotiation process.</p></reply>

Such transitional measures are normal between programming periods where a gap arises due to a delay finalising the new EU Budget and CAP regulations.   </p>  <p>  The proposals provide for a one-year transition period in 2021.  Funding arrangements for transition are based on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the new EU Multiannual Financial Framework. My officials are currently examining the proposals, which will be discussed in Brussels in the coming months and are to be agreed with the European Parliament.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the existing rules and financial arrangements for CAP, including the EU Budget allocations for the period 2014-2020, will apply for 2020, as set out in the relevant CAP regulations for both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2.</p>  <p>  My key priority remains to continue to press for agreement on the CAP reform proposals and on the maintenance of the CAP budget as part of the EU Multiannual Financial Framework. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of the proposals on the Multiannual Financial Framework, I have worked closely with other Agriculture Ministers to seek to maintain the level of CAP funding for the EU 27 and to reverse the cuts. From the start of this process, I joined with my colleagues in Madrid in May 2018 and together with France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland signed a Memorandum to call for the maintenance of the CAP budget.  Work on this initiative has continued and, most recently, at the October Agrifish Council, I again joined with my colleagues across Europe when 17 Member States joined a declaration seeking to maintain CAP funding in the period post-2020.  I will continue to work with my colleagues to fight for a strong CAP budget. </p></reply>

Factors that may impact on payment issuing under BPS/Greening would be, for example, applications to transfer entitlements, change in ownership request, etc. </p><p>The inspections yet to be completed are at various stages of final processing and once fully finalised will advance to payment stage.</p><p>My Department continues to finalise the outcome of both Ground and Remote Sensing inspections on a daily basis to ensure that BPS, Greening and ANC/Islands Schemes payments due are issued as quickly as possible. </p><p>Payments under the Organic Farming Scheme are only approved after all administration checks and validations have been completed.  A total of 1,503 applications will be subject to these checks and validations for 2019. Payments under the Scheme will not commence until early December, therefore detailed data in relation to these schemes is not yet available.</p><p>There are 328 applicants in the Burren Programme.  20 applicants have been selected for inspection, which have not yet been undertaken.  100 applicants have received their advance payment under this programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-07a.483.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110700053#WRL01500"><p>The Economics and Planning Division within DAFM carries out Spending Reviews on existing policies in conjunction with the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER).  The Spending Review mechanism is a three-year policy evaluation process to improve how Government spending is allocated and maintained. The objective of these reviews is to maximise the impact of Government spending by reprioritising spending from programmes to ensure poorer outcomes are replaced with improved outcomes. This creates a clear link between the programme evaluations carried out across the public sector and the budgetary process. For DAFM, this involves ongoing policy analyses across a range of specific programmes.</p>  <p>  The Spending Review on the TB Programme was published on Budget Day. Many of its findings are consistent with previous reviews of the TB Programme and with the Interim Report submitted to me by the Chairman of the TB Stakeholder Forum. </p>  <p>  Irish farmers make a significant financial contribution to the TB Programme. Based on 2018 Programme costs, farmers provided approximately 38% of total Programme costs, the State was expected to provide 51% and the EU expected to contribute 11%. However, as a result of consecutive years of deteriorating headline TB herd incidence, the Commission has notified Ireland that it intends to withhold 10% of funding related to 2018 - the equivalent of &euro;1m. Therefore, the EU contribution in respect of 2018 is most likely to be &euro;8.7 million as opposed to the expected &euro;9.7 million. </p>  <p>  2019 is likely to be the third consecutive year of increasing TB herd incidence. This will result in a 20% EU funding penalty or &euro;1.6 million reduction in respect of 2019. At present, these funding gaps will have to be met by the Irish taxpayer which further highlights the need for all stakeholders in the TB Programme to show leadership in ensuring TB levels are brought back onto a downward trajectory.</p>  <p>  I note the comments from some stakeholders which are seeking increased rates of financial support for farmers who experience a TB restriction. I am acutely aware of the mental and financial challenges that face farmers who experience a TB restriction. While not designed to nor claiming to replace all income foregone related to a TB restriction, it is recognised that relative to other comparable jurisdictions, Ireland has the most supportive suite of financial aids in place for herdowners who experience a TB breakdown. Policy amendments agreed in 2015 to income supplement and hardship grants have also seen expenditure on these supports increase by over 80% at a time when disease trends have seen little change.</p>  <p>  Q3 statistics related to the TB Programme were released by my Department in recent weeks. While TB herd incidence remains at relatively low levels, it is of significant concern that 2019 is likely to mark the third consecutive year of deterioration in bovine TB. This means that collectively we have failed to reduce the number of farm families who endure a TB restriction.</p>  <p>  My view is that the focus now needs to be on eradication and on policies that will deliver this objective. This represents the greatest potential return on investment to all stakeholders and particularly to Irish farmers.</p>  <p>  Reflecting this, I am willing to invest further in measures such as:</p>  <p>  - Putting extra staff resources into the team that addresses disease transmission from wildlife;</p>  <p>  - Engaging in further research including examining if deer are playing a role in spreading bovine TB;</p>  <p>  - Engaging more closely with herdowners in blackspot areas - this reflects successful initiatives in addressing specific problem areas such as the Iveragh Peninsula in 2018 and ongoing challenges in Cavan/Monaghan; and</p>  <p>  - Engaging and intervening more closely with herds that have a history of repeated, prolonged or sizeable breakdowns.</p>  <p>  These measures can directly impact on TB eradication.  The achievement of this objective would mean 4,000 families annually would no longer suffer the hardship and stress of a TB breakdown. The direct savings to farmers alone is estimated at approximately &euro;35 million per annum, and that is before any market or other impacts are factored in.  It would be regrettable if the issue of compensation, which has most recently been reviewed in 2015, were to detract from this objective.</p>  <p>  I will be launching a renewed TB Strategy in the coming weeks which aims to support farmers in the most effective way - by eradicating bovine TB by 2030. </p></reply>

The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required.</p>  <p>  Since July 2013, the Department has engaged in an extensive process of mapping broadband availability in Ireland in order to identify premises requiring State intervention. The mapping exercise has been supported by a number of public consultations which have elicited significant response from industry and the public. The most significant changes to the NBP Map took place in 2017. The Department added a further 84,500 premises to the Intervention Area where commercial investment plans previously provided to the Department had failed to materialise. The update also removed 300,000 premises from the intervention area on the basis of what was then a planned infrastructure build, that eir entered into a Commitment Agreement in respect of. An updated NBP Map was then published in April 2017 encompassing 540,000 premises in the intervention area for the purposes of the NBP procurement. </p>  <p>  A further consultation on the NBP Map was held in January 2018. Responses from industry were limited and the NBP Map remained unchanged for the purposes of Final Tender in September 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department recently conducted a public consultation to close the ongoing mapping exercise, seeking submissions from operators who wish to have their existing high speed broadband networks, or who have developed plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the next 7 years, to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. That consultation was extended twice at the request of operators, resulting in a total nine week period for submissions and it closed on 30th September 2019. </p>  <p>  As part of the consultation, over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public.</p>  <p>  Operator submissions are assessed against the Department&rsquo;s published assessment criteria. Operators submitting planned investments are required to sign a declaration that they will enter into a Commitment Agreement with the Department if their plans satisfy the assessment criteria and are accepted by the Department as being concrete and credible.</p>  <p>  The findings of the consultation, which will be available in the coming weeks, will ensure that the State Intervention Area is up to date and that it reflects commercial operators&rsquo; plans and the responses from householders and businesses, in advance of a contract being signed later this year. This will be an important element in concluding the State Aid approval process with the European Commission</p></reply>

This followed a tender process designed to ensure that every home and business throughout the country will have access to future proofed high speed broadband and will cater specifically to an estimated 1.1 million people, representing almost 25% of the population of rural Ireland who would not otherwise have access to this vital service.

Tusla funding to such counselling services in 2018 was some &euro;6.2m. This funding is provided where there is a genuine need and demand for services and where they can be provided at low cost to adults, couples, children, young people and families.</p><p>Many of the larger organisations funded by Tusla are members of the Association for Agency-based Counselling &amp;amp; Psychotherapy (AACPI). Other counselling services are being offered in certain Family Resource Centres throughout the country. These services are not funded through the Family Resource Centre Programme, but through a specified funding mechanism for commissioned counselling services.</p><p>I have asked Tusla to respond directly to the Deputy with regard to the availability of services and the training and development of counsellors, which are operational matters for Tusla.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household. </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To receive the fuel allowance payment a person must be in receipt of a qualifying long term payment from my Department and also satisfy a means test. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers benefit is a short-term non means tested payment.  A community employment scheme (CE) is designed to get people back to work by offering part-time and temporary placements in jobs based within local communities and is again not considered a long term payment.  Participants on a CE scheme can take up other part-time work during their placement without it affecting the payment rate they receive for participating on the CE scheme.  Therefore neither Jobseekers benefit nor CE schemes are qualifying payments for receipt of fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Participants on Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection Employment Support Schemes (ESS) such as a CE scheme can be paid fuel allowance where they satisfied conditions for fuel allowance prior to commencing the scheme and where they continue to satisfy the conditions.  If the ESS participant was in receipt of a long term qualifying payment prior to going onto the ESS this will allow them to satisfy the qualifying payment element.  However, they must also satisfy all other qualifying conditions to qualify for the payment.</p>  <p>  Any decision to amend the criteria for receiving fuel allowance to allow a CE scheme to be a qualifying payment would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional heating cost.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They prepared the 2016 Report &ldquo;Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency - Fire Services in Ireland&rdquo;.  The Validation Groups Report indicated that generally the fire services provided in Ireland were operating to appropriate standards delivered with integrity and professionalism by those with responsibility for managing and delivering fire safety and fire services in Ireland. A further External Validation process is due to commence in the near future and it will have a renewed focus on high-rise fire capabilities.</p><p>With specific reference to the Grenfell Tower fire in the UK, the Grenfell Tower tragedy took place on 14 June 2017 and I established a Fire Safety Task Force to examine fire safety in Ireland, and in particular the risk of a similar tragedy happening here, on 27 June. The Report of the Task Force which is available on my Department's website, was brought to Government in May 2018. </p><p>Overall, the Report, which included a review of fire safety in 839 buildings over 6 storeys, found that the combination of factors that contributed to the Grenfell Tower fire do not seem to be present in Ireland and that the current fire safety strategy in Ireland, which includes evacuation, is appropriate and effective in protecting people living in medium to high-rise buildings.</p><p>The Report did, however, make a range of recommendations for improvements in relation to fire safety and work is underway in terms of: regulatory provisions; fire service operations and fire safety, particularly around fire detection and alarm systems.</p><p>I have now asked my Department to review the Report on Phase 1 of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, which was recently published and to bring forward any additional recommendations as appropriate. </p><p>Equipment is  generally a matter for fire authorities based on their assessment of fire risk and requirements.

The Review Group Report was submitted to my Department on 24 September 2019. A report on my conclusions of the review, as well as the Review Group Report, has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required by the Act and copies of both reports are available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Review Group acknowledges that the SHD arrangements have generally been a success in meeting their objectives to contribute to addressing housing undersupply issues by providing a fast-track development consent process aimed at incentivising developers to bring forward applications for large-scale housing developments. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the positive contribution the SHD arrangements have made, the Review Group noted that only 37% of SHD planning permissions have commenced development and suggests that, subject to further monitoring of activation rates, consideration could be given to the introduction of a policy measure such as a &ldquo;use-it-or-lose-it&rdquo; provision to incentivise the commencement of works post the granting of planning permission.</p>  <p>  I have reflected on the views of the Review Group on the rate of activation of SHD sites, and  I consider it appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission in a timely manner given the benefits the SHD arrangements provide.  Therefore, I consider that it would be appropriate to introduce  a "use it or lose it" measure in this regard and I intend bringing forward the necessary legislation to address this matter. </p></reply>

Ireland signed up to the Agreement in 2003.  The agreement includes a commitment that &ldquo;Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables."  This is because there is slow accumulation of lead from shot in wetlands where hunting occurs.  The lead is generally harmful in the environment and can also be consumed by wildfowl. </p>  <p>  Since the Agreement was signed, the European Commission has published a draft Regulation for consideration by Member States on the use of lead shot in wetlands following a report on the matter by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).  It is my understanding that the proposal, should it ultimately progress into law, would make provision for a lead-in time to facilitate the making of arrangements to source alternatives to lead shot.  </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that a ban on using lead in gunshot would raise a number of issues which would need to be considered including the mapping of wetlands and issues surrounding a transition to new guns/gunshot for many gun owners in Ireland, including farmers and hunters.   </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that a transition to non-lead options would be addressed in consultation with stakeholders.  My Department recently submitted a document for circulation to the REACH Committee of the European Union suggesting an extended lead-in time to enable hunters and farmers and other stakeholders in the country to make the necessary arrangements.</p></reply>

My officials have had initial discussions with Foras na Gaeilge to explore how this anniversary might be marked.</p>  <p>  As yet, I have not received an approach from Donegal County Council or the organisation referred to by the Deputy on the matter, but I would of course be open to a discussion between my Department and either party to help ensure that this anniversary will be marked appropriately.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the heritage of Colmcille was celebrated at a special event in the Music Room in Christ Church Cathedral on Saturday 8 June, the eve of the Feast of Colmcille. The event was part of a partnership programme between Foras na Gaeilge and B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig, which promotes the use of Irish and Scottish Gaelic in Ireland and in Scotland and between the two countries.</p></reply>
