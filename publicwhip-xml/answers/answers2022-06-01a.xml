An Post and OSi have confirmed to my officials that the property in question has been assigned a verified postal address and geo-location and this information has been added to the An Post database. However, the new postal address, geo-location and other information for the property in question was added to the An Post database subsequent to the database being released to Capita in early April for the assignment of an Eircode. My officials have been informed that this information will be included in the next quarterly update of the database being supplied to Capita.</p>  <p>  Also, Capita have advised my officials that they have been in direct contact with the individual in question and will continue to monitor the case, reverting to the property owner with updates as soon as further information is available. </p>  <p>  The next quarterly release of new Eircodes is due mid-August and will include a notification letter sent to each property providing the Eircode of that address; new Eircodes will be published on the free to use Eircode Finder website and an updated Eircode Database will be provided to licenced businesses for their use.</p></reply>

The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Several suppliers are now advertising their CEG tariffs. </p><p>  Eligible customers are already accruing the value of the CEG for exported electricity and payments, which will commence after 1 July, will be backdated to the date of eligibility or the 15th February, whichever is latest. Under the Microgeneration Support Scheme the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will extend the domestic solar PV grant scheme to businesses in the near future, with a maximum grant of &euro;2,400 available.</p><p>  Non-domestic projects greater than 6kW up to 50kW will be eligible for the Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff per kWh exported for a period of 15 years from their electricity supplier. The CEP will be &euro;0.135/kWh in 2022. Any shortfall between the CEP tariff and wholesale electricity prices will be supported by the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy. Exported volumes of electricity eligible for the CEP tariff will be capped at 80% of generation capacity to incentivise self-consumption. The CRU will undertake a public consultation on the implementation plan for the CEP in Q3 2022.</p></reply>

Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned. An electricity supplier can increase or decrease the rates charged to customers in line with what has been signed up to in the contract. This may include increasing/decreasing the unit rate, the standing charge or any additional charges on bills.</p><p>  The CRU encourages customers to shop around for better offers from other suppliers and has accredited a number of switching websites to assist customers in this process.

Ireland prepared a draft of the LTS in 2019 in line with the then climate ambition set out in Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. However, with the Programme for Government commitment to substantially increase our climate ambition, including our 2050 objective, submission of Ireland&rsquo;s draft LTS to the European Commission was paused to ensure it fully aligned with our enhanced climate ambition.</p><p>  In July 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted giving legal effect to a 2050 climate neutrality target. The Act also provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030, compared to 2018 levels, and puts in place a rigorous governance structure, including a requirement for Government to prepare a National Long-term Climate Action Strategy at least once every five-years.</p><p>  As we finalise Ireland&rsquo;s LTS, we are ensuring that the ambition aligns with our recently legislated for national climate targets, as well as making a strong contribution to the overall EU ambition of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and achieving an interim reduction in overall EU greenhouse gas emissions of 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Similarly, the LTS will support our commitment to the international objective of limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C relative to pre-industrial levels, as established under the Paris Climate Agreement, and recently reaffirmed in the Glasgow Climate Pact.</p><p>  Ireland, as one of several Member States still to submit its Long-term Climate Strategy, has continued to engage with the European Commission on this issue, and has fully appraised the Commission of the approach as set out above.</p></reply>

I am further advised that almost 67,700 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 23 counties, with over 56,600 premises passed across 22 counties and available for immediate connection. NBI has advised that almost 5,800 premises have been passed with high speed broadband in County Cork. </p><p>The queries raised in the Questions regarding the timeframes for surveying phases in mid-Cork are an operational matter for NBI. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. </p><p>NBI has made recent improvements to its website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie/reps. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 20 May, 584 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 23 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date.  Further details can be found at <i>nbi.ie/bcp-locations/</i>.  </p><p>In County Cork 45 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at <i>nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/</i>.</p></reply>

These levies will work in a similar way to the plastic bag levy, which has been so successful in tackling plastic bag litter,  and  all proceeds will be ringfenced in a Circular Economy Fund to support environmental projects and initiatives. These new environmental levies will be introduced incrementally, with the initial focus on the introduction of levies on single-use disposable hot drinks cups later this year. </p>  <p>  Revenue generated will, of course, be determined by numbers of disposable cups used following the introduction of the levy. However, it is important to note that this environmental levy is not primarily intended as a revenue raising measure, but rather as a means of incentivising increased use of affordable, re-usable alternatives to disposable coffee cups. Such cups are single use items which represent an almost entirely avoidable waste stream. In that context, the more successful the levy is in terms of affecting behavioural change the lower the revenue generated.   </p></reply>

Matters relating to the cost and focus of grid investment are operational matters for EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). EirGrid is the transmission system operator and its responsibilities include the appropriate development of the grid and power system to achieve our energy policy objectives and underpin economic development. The CRU is the independent energy regulator and, through a formal price review process (the most recent being Price Review 5 (PR5)), it decides on the appropriate spend by EirGrid and ESB Networks (as the distribution system operator) on a five-year basis.</p><p>  The PR5 decision by the CRU in December 2020 signalled a significant and necessary increase in funds for grid enhancement. EirGrid already seeks to optimise the existing electricity grid to minimise the need for new infrastructure through upgrades, refurbishment or up-voltaging of existing infrastructure, where possible. However, in light of the Government's ambition to have up to 80% renewable electricity on the power system by 2030, and with demand profiles increasing as we continue to electrify more sectors of our economy, such as transport and heating, further investment in the power grid will be required over the coming decade.</p><p>  The CRU issued a final determination for funding over the next five years to the end of 2025 which can be found on the CRU website. It indicates a capital investment of &euro;4 billion across the transmission and distribution network.</p></reply>

SEAI forecasts, in November 2020, indicated that Ireland would not achieve its renewable energy target by 2020 and would instead have a shortfall of between 3-4%.   On an ex-ante basis, statistical transfers were purchased at a cost of &euro;50m, with 1,000 GWh purchased from Denmark at a cost of &euro;12.5m and 2,500 GWh from Estonia at a cost of &euro;37.5m. The final energy outturn for 2020, which became available in October 2021, confirmed that, prior to the purchase of statistical transfers from Denmark and Estonia, Ireland's energy use from renewable energy sources was 13.53%.</p>  <p>  Following the purchase of statistical transfers, this resulted in Ireland achieving an outturn of 16.16%. Therefore, no further purchases were required, as the 2020 target had been met.</p></reply>

In 2020, the ESRI estimated that 17.5% of households in Ireland could be at risk of energy poverty. Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of energy poverty when energy prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their energy needs increases.  </p>  <p>  The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. Recognising the unprecedented rise in energy prices facing people the Government put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year including:</p>  <p>  -an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March.</p>  <p>  - the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT) credited to domestic electricity accounts.</p>  <p>  - specific measures in the new National Retrofit Schemes to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation.</p>  <p>  -To further manage the impact of price increases the Government, in the recently published National Energy Security Framework, announced a number of additional measures for households and businesses including:</p>  <p>  - A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.</p>  <p>  -A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.</p>  <p>  -A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.</p>  <p>  -The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.</p>  <p>  -A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.</p>  <p>  -An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  -The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, electricity and gas suppliers, overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.</p>  <p>  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The Group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has commenced examination of the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland. The main goal is to provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable households. A work programme, proposed outputs and timelines will be agreed and finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in the coming weeks to inform future policy in this area.</p></reply>

Providing a sustainable, low-carbon transport system is a key priority of my Department. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The national car and van fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.</p><p>The Government has already committed significant funding to support low emitting vehicles through the National Development Plan, which currently includes an allocation of almost &euro;500 million for the period 2021-2025 and additional support from the Climate Action Fund. This funding includes both capital grants to support the purchase of EVs and capital funding for the delivery of EV charging infrastructure.</p><p>&euro;100m has been allocated in 2022 to ensure the continued transition to electric vehicles.  This is an almost doubling of the provision made available in 2021 and underpins the Government&rsquo;s commitment to making electric vehicles accessible to all. This funding will continue to incentivise the switch to electric vehicles as well as enabling the expansion of a fast and rapid electric vehicle charging network to stay ahead of demand. Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, ZEVI, is currently being established to coordinate this work. </p><p>This includes:</p><p>- Continuation of the purchase grant scheme at existing levels for fully electric passenger cars and vans, and the refocusing of exchequer funding on zero tailpipe emission vehicles.</p><p>- Continuation and expansion of the home charging infrastructure scheme to include multi-unit dwellings.</p><p>- Continuation of a grant scheme for taxi and hackney drivers.</p><p>- Continuation of an alternatively fuelled heavy goods vehicles purchase grant scheme.</p><p>- Continuation of the Low Emission Vehicle Toll Incentive Scheme.</p><p>- Introduction of a revised scheme for public point charging.</p><p>- Introduction of a new scheme for electric vans.</p><p>- Introduction of a new scheme for destination charging.</p><p>As part of preparations for Budget 2023, I have asked Departmental officials to review the full range Exchequer supports currently provided to EV owners to ensure that they not only offer value to the Exchequer as part of decarbonisation of transport, but are also fit for purpose moving forward.</p></reply>

The timeframe for delivery on this commitment is the second quarter of 2022. The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of  residential properties including, where unoccupied, the duration and reason for this, in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025. This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax. </p>  <p>  In considering the case for such a tax it is important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties. It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate or, indeed, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons.</p>  <p>  In the design of any tax, it would be important to achieve an appropriate balance between putting enough pressure on vacant home owners to allow the measure to actually work as an incentive to increase the supply of housing, and ensuring any such tax does not arbitrarily or excessively penalise home-owners in a discriminatory way.  This would include consideration of appropriate exemptions from any charge in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy.</p>  <p>  Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. I will consider the issue in consultation with colleagues before reverting to Government with proposals on the appropriate response. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns in due course.</p></reply>

The first relates to allowing deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties (extended recently in Finance Act 2021).  The second restored to 100% from January 2019 the amount of interest that can be deducted on mortgages for residential rental properties. Both measures might be expected to contribute to a modest extent at least to the desired outcome mentioned in Deputy Kerrane's question. </p><p>As regards further tax measures aimed at assisting landlords, the position is that proposals for any new tax reliefs must be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p><p>Currently, I have no plans to introduce measures along the lines of those outlined by the Deputies.  I look forward to the outcome of my Department&rsquo;s review of the 2017 report in due course. </p></reply>

Some of the main features of the current regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base. Changing the tax rate (or imposing additional levies on certain sectors) could have unforeseen consequences. There is a risk of such taxes leading to higher consumer costs and negative impacts on investment in the energy sector, in particular in the area of renewables. </p>  <p>  Proposals for a windfall tax must take into account wider energy policy, under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. A well-functioning EU electricity market is crucial for the integration of our Internal Energy Market and supporting investment in new renewables. The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term. </p>  <p>  The complexities of the energy market and the range of producers and contracts must also be taken into account. For example, the Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS) contains strong consumer protection measures, with wholesale market revenues above the auction price returned to electricity consumers through the Public Service Obligation Levy. </p>  <p>  The Government approved and published the National Energy Security Framework on the 13th April. It set out that the Government will work with the European Commission and other Member States to consider the policy proposals outlined under REPowerEU, designed to aid consumers and businesses to deal with increasing energy costs. REPowerEU is a joint European action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy.  The European Commission published the REPowerEU Plan on 18 May and analysis of these proposals is currently being undertaken.  Consideration of the potential for a windfall tax is a small part of ongoing work in this area. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the burden on consumers in relation to the cost of energy. This includes providing &euro;200 worth of energy credit to every household in the country; reductions in fuel excise duty; and a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas. </p></reply>

With regard to the 2020 SCEP allocation, it should be noted that the grant remains at "provisional allocation" stage. The transfer of a grant from one organisation to another requires the approval of my Department and there are a number of other requirements which must be met before formal approval issues. One of the requirements of the SCEP is that grantees are "not for profit" organisations and my Department may seek proof of this status. In relation to the grant referred to by the Deputy, the status of the grantee will be considered further if a formal approval request is submitted. </p></reply>

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.

The draft regulations have also been screened for Appropriate Assessment (AA) under the Habitats Directive by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit (EAU) and the need for AA has been screened out. </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the AA process on the draft regulations in April, my Department immediately sought to progress the statutory SEA process.  A four week statutory consultation with the environmental authorities on the scope of the SEA Environmental Report commenced on the 28 April 2022 and ran until 27 May 2022.</p>  <p>  The SEA Environmental Report is currently being updated and finalised on foot of this consultation. Once finalised, the SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside the draft regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to launch during the week commencing 13 June 2022.  Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before the finalisation of the draft regulations. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. Accordingly, the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months.</p></reply>

Nationally, the average cost to deliver one of these homes under the Scheme is c.&euro;196,000 including the cost for the necessary improvement works to the properties.</p><p>The Housing Agency Acquisitions Fund is a &euro;70 million revolving that was established in January 2017 with the objective of enabling the Housing Agency to acquire vacant units from banks and investment companies for social housing use.  The fund is replenished by the Housing Agency through the sale of units primarily to the AHB sector and the funds received are then recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions.</p><p>The Table below gives a breakdown of the number of properties delivered under each of the schemes in each local authority up to the end of Q4 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>LA</th>       <th>Repair&amp;amp; Lease Total   Properties Delivered up to Q4 2021  </th>       <th>Buy and Renew   Dwellings Delivered up to Q4 2021</th>       <th>Housing Agency Acquisitions Fund Delivered up to end Q4 2021  </th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>48</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>53</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>71</td>       <td>126</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DLR</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>164</td>       <td>229</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>164</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway City</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>25</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>41</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>75</td>       <td>84</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>122</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>85</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>99</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>88</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SDCC</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>71</td>       <td>71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>126</td>       <td>57</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>207</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>64</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>279</td>       <td>728</td>       <td>845</td>       <td>1852</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

We have raised these concerns, along with our partners in the EU and the wider international community, on a number of occasions, both at Ministerial and official level.  I raised these issues directly with my Chinese counterpart, State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during a visit to China in May 2021. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also been active on Xinjiang in the United Nations framework. At the 49th United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2022, Ireland&rsquo;s national statement called on China to comply with its obligations under national and international law to respect and protect human rights in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  In October 2021, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on the situation in Xinjiang, delivered at the Third Committee of the 76th UN General Assembly. The statement calls attention to the arbitrary detention of over a million people in Xinjiang and the &ldquo;systematic human rights violations, including reports documenting torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue also provides opportunity to raise specific concerns, including in relation to Xinjiang. Ireland and our EU partners remain committed to ensuring that the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue resumes as soon as possible and I am encouraged by the progress made in this regard at the EU-China Summit in April this year. </p>  <p>  The EU has also initiated sanctions under the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime against four Chinese persons and one entity for their role in Xinjiang. These sanctions are designed to act as a deterrent and encourage changes in these actors&rsquo; behaviour. Sanctions are based on solid legal evidence and are deployed alongside other measures, including dialogue. </p>  <p>  Through our Embassy in Beijing Ireland closely followed the visit to China of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet. Ireland had been calling for this visit, and for full, meaningful and unfettered access for the High Commissioner and her team. High Commissioner Bachelet visited Kashgar and Urumqi, both cities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, along with Guangzhou in southern China. We are now assessing the outcome of this trip and we will continue to call for the publication of the High Commissioner&rsquo;s full report on the situation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asks about a designation of genocide. It is a term that has a particular meaning under international law and the recognition of events definitively as genocide involves a complex analysis of both facts and law. Ireland follows the practice of recognising genocide only where this has been established by a final decision of a court in Ireland or a judgment of an international court, or where there is international consensus on the matter. To date, this has not been the case as regards the situation in Xinjiang. </p>  <p>  Ireland's practice in this regard does not undermine the seriousness with which the Government approaches the situation in Xinjiang. The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora to address our concerns.</p></reply>

Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.</p>  <p>  Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online and Passport Online is available to 97% of all applicants across the world. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.</p>  <p>  Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.</p>  <p>  The paper-based, mail-in "Post Passport" service is available to citizens at almost 1,000 An Post post offices. A paper-based, mail-in service is also available at over 70 post office locations in Northern Ireland. The Passport Service continues to see a steady, but increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland. With the availability of both Passport Online and the postal application channel, very few applicants are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport.</p>  <p>  In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel urgently and do not have a valid passport, the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork offer an Urgent Appointment service for passport renewal with a 1 or 4-day turnaround. The Passport Service offices in Dublin and Cork have processed over 5,000 Urgent Appointments to date in 2022. These Urgent Appointment applications represents just 0.9% of the total 540,000 applications received by the Passport Service since January of this year.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied overall that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants and that recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. While there are no plans to open additional passport offices, the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.</p></reply>

Staff on the Oireachtas Line continue to work productively under increasing pressure. They are dealing with record numbers of calls and queries every week and have handled over 12,200 queries from Members since the beginning of this year. Passport Service staff on the Oireachtas Line receive comprehensive general Passport Service training, as well as customer service training.</p>  <p>  I am aware that many Deputies are receiving a large number of passport queries from constituents due to the continued high demand for passports. Since last week, the number of staff on the Oireachtas Urgent Query Service team has increased from seven to eleven full time staff. As of last week, up to 20 queries per week from each Oireachtas Member can be facilitated by this team.</p>  <p>  In each case raised by an Oireachtas Member, the Passport Service reviews the application in question. However, applications can only be expedited in cases of genuine emergency such as a need for urgent medical treatment overseas or the death of a family member abroad. Such applications are expedited through the Travel Emergency service.</p>  <p>  In cases where the estimated issue-by date has passed and all required supporting documents have been submitted, the Passport Service will prioritise the application to ensure that no further delay is experienced.</p>  <p>  Non-urgent cases should continue to be dealt with through the existing phone lines and web chat facilities.  Passport applications, that are being processed in line with their turnaround times cannot be expedited.  Where the estimated issue by date has been exceeded this will result in a query being raised internally in the Passport Service. The Passport Service will work to issue a passport or respond to a request for further information to the customer within two working days.</p>  <p>  While Deputies often hear of the most complex and pressing cases, the overwhelming majority of passport applicants have their passport processed without any recourse to their local TD. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years. In 2019, which was the busiest year for passports pre-Covid, the Passport Service had issued 470,000 passports by the end of May. In the same time period this year, over 540,000 passports have been issued. In 2021, 634,000 passports were issued in the whole year. In five months the Passport Service has issued over 80% of the total number of passports that were issued in the whole of last year.</p>  <p>  Passport applicants can track the status of their passport application online via the Passport Tracker which is available on my Department's website - www.dfa.ie/passporttracking/. The information on the tracker has recently been upgraded, and is an excellent guide as to where an application is in the system.</p>  <p>  I would ask Oireachtas colleagues to ensure that their constituents are aware of the processing times outlined below and encourage them to apply online well in advance of any planned travel. </p>  <p>  The current processing times for passport applications are:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p>  <p>  - 30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online (applications received from 19 April)</p>  <p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Post Passport" service  </p></reply>

EU leaders have acted swiftly in inviting the European Commission to submit its opinion on Ukraine's application to become a member.

Ireland will continue to engage fully in discussions with EU partners, at all levels, in the coming weeks, as the consideration of Ukraine's application is underway. </p></reply>

It is envisaged that this draft proposal, which would be voluntary for parents/guardians and children could present a more suitable option than Home Tuition for some children as they await a special class placement. Many of these families are having difficulties in securing a tutor for this work. Families would now have access to an alternative to Home Tuition providing them with </p><p>1. Access to fully qualified teachers removing the burden of sourcing an appropriately qualified home tutor</p><p>2. An opportunity for their child(ren) to interact with their peers and access education in a school/classroom environment which is &lsquo;out-of-home&rsquo;</p><p>3. Integration opportunities, where possible, on a case by case basis. </p><p>It is envisaged that these centres would follow the standard school day and school year. It is intended that the Centres will be located to facilitate engagement with local schools with a view to optimising integration opportunities for children in local schools. Integration and transition arrangements for local schools and the SEN Centres will be developed by the NCSE in conjunction with the Inspectorate and NEPs. These arrangements will be kept under continuing review by the ETBs, the Department and the NCSE.</p><p>The Centres would also be located in areas where additional special class provision is due to come on stream as various building projects progress. </p><p>I must highlight that this proposal is very much at an early stage and further significant work is required to progress the proposal and further work is required in relation to engaging with key stakeholders and advocacy groups on the draft proposal. A further meeting with advocacy groups on the draft proposal is scheduled for later this week. </p><p>Families can be assured that the Department and NCSE remain committed to opening special classes as quickly as possible and this proposal is offered as a child and family centred interim solution.</p></reply>

However, careful attention has been given to discourse and commentary on the Bill, which has stretched back to the time of the passage of the 2015 Act itself, and for which significant consultations were undertaken. In that regard it is noted that the Amendment Bill is primarily by way of procedural improvement to the 2015 Act, not a significant policy change. </p>  <p>  It should be also be noted that a consultation process took place at the beginning of the year on the codes of practice that will accompany the commencement of the Act, and that regular engagement between the Department and disability groups has take place in various fora, which has facilitated input on Assisted Decision-Making legislation.   </p>  <p>  Whilst not a full consultation, an update and discussion on the progress of the legislation took place with members of the Disability Stakeholder Group (DSG) on 15th March at my Department's Disability Consultative Committee meeting, and subsequently to the wider DSG at the March meeting of the full National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group. The DSG is a voluntary group that oversees implementation of the Strategy and provides input to wider government disability policy, and is comprised of individuals and groups with experience of disability issues, whether lived experience, professional or academic expertise, advocacy or civil society experience, or as representatives of disabled person's organisations (DPOs).  </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, has overseen the preparations for commencement of the Act and these officials have also engaged with various bodies in relation to Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.</p></reply>

The review was originally anticipated to occur in June of 2022.  However, the UN Committee has not communicated a date for the review or given an indication of a likely date for Ireland&rsquo;s appearance at the Committee.</p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation - each year moving forward on key reforms, through delivery of two whole-of-government national strategies - the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES). This model involves obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. On this basis, initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments and requirements.</p></reply>

As a result of the Deputy's question, my Department contacted Tusla and they gave us the following information about the situation:  </p>  <p>  -On the 26th January 2022 the HSE published the Maskey Review into the care received by children and young people at South Kerry Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMHS) services.</p>  <p>  - Further to the findings of that report, Tusla identified 6 Children in the care of the State as having suffered harm arising out of the medical practice of a CAMHS medical practitioner during the period of investigation. 2 of these 6 children were identified as having suffered significant harm arising out of the medical practice of a CAMHS medical practitioner.</p>  <p>  - The 6 children identified have been reviewed by CAMHS and meetings offered to both the foster carers of the children and the parents of the children. The assigned Social Worker to the children attended the meetings between the Health Services Executive and the parents. All 6 children have been offered Health Screening from the HSE &amp;amp; their carers have been informed of the Compensation Scheme. The needs of these 6 children are reviewed formally in their child care reviews in line with Regulations.</p>  <p>  - Tusla identified 14 other children in the care of the State as having accessed the service or having been referred to the service during the period of the investigation. These children were viewed not to have been harmed by the medical practice of the CAMHS medical practitioner. The needs of these 14 children are reviewed formally in their child care reviews in line with Regulations.</p>  <p>  - CAMHS provides copies of all correspondence to ensure Tulsa &amp;amp; the Social Work Department specifically has relevant and up to date information, in order to support both the children and the foster carers into the future.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that statutory and operational responsibility for the delivery of child protection and welfare services is a matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. CAMHS is managed by the Health Service Executive, and is a separate entity to Tusla. In some instances, a child in the care of Tusla may require a service or support that is provided by another Agency such as the HSE. </p>  <p>  Tusla and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth are committed to promoting safe and high quality practice in all areas of alternative care. In all instances the best interests of those children in the care of the State must remain the paramount concern.</p></reply>

This group has met regularly in the context of making preparations for the full operationalisation of the Decision Support Service, including preparing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022. There has been further and extensive bilateral engagement between members and member organisations, and other organisations not permanently represented on the Group, as has been required.</p>  <p>  Part 8 of the 2015 Act is and remains the responsibility of the Minister for Health.

The Act creates obligations for the public sector regarding the provision of ISL. In addition, the Act provides for specific duties and obligations in the areas of legal proceedings, educational provision and broadcasting.</p>  <p>  Implementing the Irish Sign Language Act requires a whole of government approach. As such, all public bodies have obligations to fulfill. My Department has an important role to play in monitoring the implementation of the Act to ensure that users of Irish Sign Language have equal access to the services of the State and equal opportunities to achieve their full potential.</p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Act requires a report on the operation of the Act to be produced, initially three years after enactment and every five years thereafter. These reports must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  In line with these requirements, the National Disability Authority (NDA) was commissioned to produce the first report on the operation of the Act. </p>  <p>  My department is advised on a regular basis by the NDA on a range disability issues. This engagement has included the development and status of the ISL Report.</p>  <p>  No interim report on the operation of the ISL Act was received by my Department, as the request made to the NDA was for a single comprehensive report. In the course of preparing the final version of the Report, drafts were received and observations were sought from relevant departments and public bodies. The final version of the report has now been finalised and formally submitted.</p>  <p>  The NDA Report is now receiving detailed consideration within my Department. As the recommendations of the Report affect a wide range of organisations, it has been necessary to consider the whole of Government implications arising. I intend to publish the report at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 16 of the report by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection was that provision should be made to cover legal costs associated with a declaration of parentage of persons affected by illegal birth registrations. In response, the Government approved a once-off payment of &euro;3,000 for the individuals whose illegal birth registration has been confirmed by Tusla from the files of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild. </p>  <p>  This once-off payment of &euro;3,000 is intended as contribution towards costs such as creating or amending wills or seeking a declaration of parentage. While it could also be used for DNA testing, Tusla has covered the costs of DNA testing for individuals in cases where records were insufficient to confirm an illegal birth registration and will continue to provide this support. </p>  <p>  The development of this scheme is at an advanced stage with a view to implementation as soon as possible in 2022. </p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other State agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard. A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025". This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across Government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p>  <p>I can inform the Deputy that on 2   July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs.</p>  <p>  Recent successes of Operation Tara include:</p>  <p>  - Garda&iacute; arrested and charged 3 men in Co Louth following the seizure of an estimated &euro;90,000 worth of drugs on 10 May;</p>  <p>  - A man and a woman arrested by the Galway Divisional Drugs Unit on 11 May following a seizure of &euro;70,300 of suspected cannabis;</p>  <p>  - An estimated &euro;400,000 worth of drugs seized and two persons arrested in Cork on 09 May;</p>  <p>  - Approximately &euro;1.5 million found in follow up searches in the Newbridge area of Co Kildare after a man was arrested in Meath on the M1 with &euro;39,750 in cash in his vehicle;</p>  <p>  - An estimated &euro;779,450 worth of cocaine was seized during a search on 28 May.</p>  <p>  All drugs seized are subject to analysis by Forensic Science Ireland (FSI).</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK).</p>  <p>  I also wish to acknowledge the work of the Garda&iacute; in tackling the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. The reports of further sanctions from the US recently demonstrate the tremendous value and power of international co-operation in tackling organised crime.</p>  <p>  The cooperation on this investigation has been ongoing for four years or more, but the actions taken in recent weeks really show the degree to which the international criminal justice sector is focused on tackling the criminality associated with the Kinahan Organised Crime Group. We should not take for granted the huge achievement of the Garda&iacute; in patiently and quietly harnessing this necessary coalition of support for their work to combat this criminal group.</p>  <p>  The sanctions enforced internationally should send a very clear message to those involved in the gang, or associated with the gang; that your criminality will not go unnoticed or unpunished.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation of over &euro;2 billion for 2022.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a strong tradition of community engagement and visible policing, and this funding demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources required to build on this high level of engagement and to ensure our communities are safe. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I was pleased to attend the Garda College in Templemore on 19 May, where 101 new Garda members passed-out. These new members have now completed their training and will be assigned to Garda Divisions throughout the country. A further attestation will take place at the College on 8 July.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a Garda recruitment competition recently closed and I was pleased to see the strong interest evident in the over 11,000 applications which were received. It is vital that everyone in our society sees members of their own communities serving in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I particularly welcome that 40% of applicants were women and that there is a notable increase in numbers applying from minority backgrounds including Travellers and people from our new Irish communities.  Successful candidates from this competition will begin entering the Garda college later this year, and the new panel will provide the capacity for continued recruitment into next year.</p>  <p>  In addition, and as a result of the increasing levels of recruitment of Garda staff to the organisation, over 800 Garda members to date have also been reassigned to frontline policing duties in recent years, where their expertise and training can be best utilised to provide visible policing to our communities.  </p>  <p>  Very significant capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the provision for a capital budget of &euro;147 million for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ICT and Building Programme and ongoing investment in the organisation&rsquo;s transport fleet. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provides &euro;12m for investment in the Garda fleet, which means more high-visibility policing in our towns and cities. This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to implement high visibility policing plans to address public disorder related issues and anti-social behaviour, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and anti-social behaviour typically increase, such as bank holiday weekends. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the landscape of issues faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is changing. For example, the increase in fraud offences shows that policing does not only take place on the streets, it must also put a focus on cyber-related crimes.</p>  <p>  Finally, and of great benefit to the delivery of modern policing services in the community, the Garda Commissioner is in the course of introducing the new Garda Operating Model which, in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, is designed to make changes to the structures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide for more frontline Garda&iacute;, increased Garda visibility, and a wider range of policing services for people in their local area. </p></reply>

The scheme is designed, following detailed engagement with the people affected, to give long-term undocumented people without a current immigration permission the chance to regularise their status, access the labour market and begin their path to citizenship.</p><p>The scheme genuinely is a once-off, life-changing opportunity to obtain status in the State. I encourage everyone eligible for the scheme, who has not yet made an application, to do so before the closing date. I can assure people that we are examining applications pragmatically and humanely and we are considering all viable proofs of residence.</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of someone who might be eligible for the scheme please encourage them to come forward. Applicants will be supported in a positive way and if they are not eligible for the scheme, other immigration options can be explored. </p><p>To publicise the scheme, my Department recently commenced a targeted social medial ad campaign across all of the main social media platforms directed at the top 10 nationalities eligible under the scheme in their own native languages. This campaign will run until the scheme closes at the end of July and further targeted communications will be rolled out in the coming weeks. </p><p>As of 30 May 2022, my Department has received 4,821 applications in respect of 6,152 people under the scheme and has issued  935 positive decisions so far. Processing of all other applications remains ongoing. These figures relate to the main strand of the Scheme and not the international protection element, which is being processed separately by the International Protection Office of my Department.</p><p>Applications can be made online at: https://inisonline.jahs.ie.</p><p>Full details regarding the qualifying criteria, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document and the required documentation for the Scheme is available on my Department's website at: <i>www.irishimmigration.ie/regularisation-of-long-term-undocumented-migrant-scheme/</i>. </p><p>The International Protection Office of my Department has written to approximately 4,000 potentially eligible applicants inviting them to apply. This strand of the scheme is open for applications until 7 August 2022.  Further information can be found on the website of the IPO at: www.ipo.gov.ie/en/ipo/pages/whatsnew.  </p></reply>

This includes in relation to first-time registrations and renewals, and processes and procedures are in place to allow customers to do so. </p><p>Dublin based customers who are seeking to renew their permission can continue to do so online at: <i>inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login</i>. Since its introduction in July 2020, the online renewal process has completed approximately 125,000 applications.  </p><p>Customers wishing to renew an immigration permission may apply online up to 12 weeks in advance and are no longer asked to wait until four weeks in advance of their current permission&rsquo;s expiration date.  Current processing times are longer than usual because of extremely high demand.  The Registration Office is working to process renewals as quickly as possible. Staff are supporting customers who have travel plans in place through the customer service helpdesk. Customers are asked to email my Department at immigrationsupport@justice.ie  putting &lsquo;Flights booked for Travel&rsquo; in the subject box. Customers should also include proof of paid flights in their name so that these applications can be prioritised. </p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 741 741) was introduced for customers.</p><p>The current operating hours are 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday and all appointments for Dublin based customers to register their immigration permission for the first time are now issued through this service. Operators offer one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group. To date, the service has provided 17,405 appointments, with a further 10,459 appointments booked to early July 2022.</p><p>My Department's Registration Office customer service team is also available to support customers who may have language difficulties or who may need assistance with translation. A number of multi-lingual videos describing the registration process and what to expect are available on my Department's website <i>www.irishimmigration.ie</i>. </p><p>My Department's Registration Office in Burgh Quay is responsible for registering immigration permissions for customers residing in the Dublin area only. First time registrations and renewals for customers outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network. The allocation of appointments with GNIB is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>I recognised that additional clarity regarding immigration arrangements post 31 May was required for some groups. In particular, for employees who may be awaiting the renewal of their Irish Residence Permit card and for English language students who intend to enrol in third level courses from September. </p><p>As I announced last week, non-EEA nationals can continue to work after 31 May if they can provide documentary evidence of their ongoing application to renew their immigration permission to their employer.  For Dublin-based customers, the documentary evidence can include the email that customers receive from the Department&rsquo;s immigration service confirming that they have submitted a renewal application. An online notice for employers has been published at: </p><p><i>www.irishimmigration.ie/notice-for-employers-may-2022/</i>.  </p><p>As in previous years prior to the pandemic, English language students who have completed their maximum three 8-month courses and who intend to enrol in third level for an undergraduate or graduate course beginning in the autumn, can apply for a short-term letter of permission based on their proof of application or enrolment. This will provide them with a bridging permission over the summer months until they start their course, which they can then register in the normal way. </p></reply>

Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. </p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting Lis Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the attached document, provided to my Department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, outlines the number of patients aged over 75 on Outpatient and Inpatient waiting lists by time-band and hospital at the end of April 2022.</p><p><a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-06-01_pq192-01-06-22_en.xlsx ">patients aged over 75 on Outpatient and Inpatient waiting lists by time-band and hospital at the end of April 2022</a></p></reply>

Ukrainian medical doctors and dentists do not require an employment permit.  The ability of Ukrainian doctors and dentists to practise will be dependent on the recognition of their professional qualifications and subsequent registration with the relevant regulatory body. </p>  <p>  The Medical Council is the statutory agency responsible for the registration and regulation of doctors in Ireland. It is committed to supporting doctors arriving from Ukraine seeking to work in this jurisdiction.  The Medical Council has established an internal working group to examine ways in which it can support these doctors and has a dedicated email address and webpage for doctors arriving from Ukraine. It is working with a range of stakeholders to examine ways in which it can further support doctors arriving from Ukraine into Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Dental Council is the statutory agency responsible for the registration and regulation of dentists in Ireland and is establishing a new pathway to registration to allow it consider applications for registration from dentists fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. The Council is in regular communications with these dentists, and it recently addressed a meeting of Ukrainian dentists in Ireland to advise on its processes.  The Council is assessing the possibility of providing adaptation periods or allowing Ukrainian dentists to work under supervision if gaps in training are identified. It will only be possible to fully assess the pathway to practise for Ukrainian dentists once the Council commences processing applications.  The Dental Council will also utilise the resources made available by the EU to assist in determining how Ukrainian dental qualifications match against the EU minimum training standards for dentists, which are harmonised across the EU and EEA by the Professional Qualifications Directive.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department form part of a co-ordination group established by the European Commission to examine the registration of Ukrainian health and social care professionals arriving in EU States because of the conflict.  This group shares knowledge and best practice and is examining methods to streamline and expedite recognition of Ukrainian professional qualifications for these professionals, including the use of electronic databases, the EU information centres for academic recognition and machine translation tools. My Department, along with the Medical and Dental Councils, will continue to ensure that all avenues are being explored with a view to enabling Ukrainian qualified doctors and dentists to apply for registration, always conscious of the need to ensure that patient safety is to the fore of any decisions regarding registration.</p></reply>

This particular evidence brief aims to describe international policy and practice relating to referral for radiological tests in a selection of other jurisdictions which includes New Zealand, Canada (Alberta), England and Sweden.</p>  <p>  The research questions include:</p>  <p>  1. Describe which professionals permitted to refer/prescribe radiological tests (other than medical practitioner, nurses, radiographers, dentists). To include job titles, specific skills and qualifications to refer/prescribe radiological tests, monitoring and supervision arrangements in the selected countries.</p>  <p>  2. With regard to the above professionals identify and describe the relevant Standard Operating Procedures, protocols, advanced clinical practice guidelines, or governance principles in place in the selected countries.</p>  <p>  3. Identify and describe the advantages and disadvantages (risks) of the above professionals referring radiological tests as reported in the literature for the selected countries.</p>  <p>  The evidence brief was requested by the Strategic Workforce Planning Unit in the Department of Health and is provided through an evidence synthesis service, operated by the Research Services and Policy Unit of the Department in collaboration with the Health Research Board (HRB), which is designed to support evidence-informed decision making in the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The timeline for delivery of a draft evidence brief report is in Quarter 3 of 2022. The evidence brief is a type of literature review, it does not include consultation with stakeholders in Ireland. The findings of this evidence brief will be considered by the Department before any subsequent actions are planned.</p></reply>

The purpose is to reduce the reliance on secondary/tertiary care, harness existing resources within the community network, and to promote a programme of self-care and self-management for those with chronic disorders. The target group for the project are patients with headache disorders.</p><p>The project has established new protocols for management of headache, that provide for trained nurse prescribers who work alongside neurologists with expertise in headache, and in collaboration with GPs, the Migraine Association of Ireland and local pharmacies.<b></b>85 pharmacists are participating in the programme and over 360 patients have been referred to community pharmacy.</p><p>Significant improvements in new/return ratio in the headache clinic in St James Hospital were observed.

Active Neuro shifts the focus from rehabilitation for new onset or worsening of symptoms, to a health promoting physical activity model for prevention. Rehabilitation is available to some patients through the Community Neuro Rehabilitation Team in Limerick that offers multidisciplinary rehabilitation and the stroke unit at University Hospital Limerick has an early support discharge team that provides home based rehabilitation. The target group for this project are patients with progressive neurological conditions.</p><p>On-line interventions were delivered to 440 participants with strength maintained or improved in 82% of participants and an approximate reduction of 51 hospital bed days used.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Within the plan, implementation of obesity care pathways has been identified as a high-level priority. The HSE is engaging with the Obesity Clinical Programme regarding a comprehensive proposal to develop Obesity services with a view to progressing implementation in 2022 in line with the Waiting List Action Plan. To support additional access in the short term St Columcille&rsquo;s has secured once off funding through the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan.  </p>  <p>  The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p>  <p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting Lis Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Act provides for two categories of eligibility for persons ordinarily resident in the State, i.e. full eligibility (medical card holders) and limited eligibility (all others). Adults with full eligibility can access a range of services including GP services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultants&rsquo; services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants&rsquo; services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances, a termination of pregnancy service and a maternity and infant care service.</p>  <p>  Persons with limited eligibility are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including Consultant services, Emergency Department or minor injury care, are subject to certain charges. Other services such as allied healthcare professional services may also be made available to persons with limited eligibility. </p></reply>

In 2019, the PSC was updated and introduced a new project lifecycle, tightening the arrangements for project decision-making, and clarifying the roles of the parties involved including the responsibilities for Sponsoring Agencies and Approving Authorities. The PSC also provides detail on the business case requirements at each stage of the new project lifecycle.</p><p>All capital development proposals must progress through several approval stages, in line with the new lifecycle approach of the updated PSC, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. </p><p>The specific requirements that must be included in a business case at the various stages of the PSC, are detailed at  </p><p>The National Maternity Hospital (NMH) relocation project was initiated prior to the publication of the updated PSC, and therefore the NMH Project Board undertook additional work on the business case to ensure full compliance with the new PSC requirements.</p><p>A Final business case for relocation of NMH has been submitted to the Department by the NMH Project Board for review at Gate 2 of the PSC. The Business Case is now subject to technical review by the Department of Health, including through the External Assurance Process recently introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>Pending favourable review under the Spending Code, a Memorandum for Government will then be brought forward to progress the programme for the NMH. If approval in principle is granted by Government, the project can move to deployment of a tendering strategy. </p><p>In the interim, I have asked the Project Board to identify opportunities to accelerate or parallel certain activities related to the development of the project that can be undertaken without presupposing the outcome of the Government decision on the pre-tender final business case. The Project Board will take steps to ensure that it can act quickly to progress the project through the next stages, should approval in principle be granted.</p><p>Based on the results of public procurement process, an updated Final Business Case will then be prepared by the NMH Project Board, seeking Government sanction to proceed with the main capital project to construct the new NMH. </p><p>The final decision to proceed with the construction and therefore to estimate the cost or key dates for the new NMH cannot be made until the tender process has been completed and the costings reviewed to ensure that the proposal delivers value for money and remains affordable.</p></reply>

No patient has been or will be discharged early from the unit. </p>  <p>  This regrettable situation has arisen because a number of nursing posts have become vacant simultaneously at Linn Dara for various reasons. I wish to stress that this is not due to lack of financial resources but solely because the nursing compliment available through the use of permanent and agency staff is no longer sufficient to continue to provide a full 24 bed in-patient service to a safe standard.</p>  <p>  The HSE expect that the reduction in beds will continue until September next when new nursing graduates become available. The Executive will continue intense efforts to recruit staff as quickly as possible, with the skills and competencies to meet the needs of young people in this specialist unit. All four CAMHS units nationally will work collaboratively to maximise the use of existing national CAMHS bed capacity over coming months to minimise the impact of this development at Linn Dara.</p>  <p>  While the reduction in capacity in Linn Dara will have an impact on waiting lists, the demand for in-patient beds in CAMHS units over the summer months is usually around half the normal level of capacity.  Access to the CAMHS system is based on clinical assessment, with urgent cases prioritised.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can rest assured that I will, in conjunction with the HSE, continue to closely monitor the position in relation to Linn Dara.</p></reply>

The package seeks to  incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops through the Tillage Incentive Scheme and introduces supports to encourage farmers to grow protein crops in 2022. Supporting domestic production of tillage and protein crops is a key mechanism in reducing Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on imported feed materials.</p>  <p>  The Package also included a Multi-Species Sward Initiative and a Red Clover Silage Measure to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming, and thereby reduce nitrogen fertiliser usage, while maintaining forage yield.</p>  <p>I have also brought forward a Memorandum for Information to Government on 3rd May 2022 on a proposed Fodder Support Scheme, with the objective of supporting farm families to conserve silage and hay this year to ensure that nationally we have adequate stocks of fodder over next winter.

The areas planted with grant aided new forestry and areas licensed for Felling in the last 10 years are included below. The Department does not report on areas afforested where grant aid was not provided.</p><p>According to the National Forestry inventory, the forest estate is approximately 770,000ha, which accounts for 11% of land cover of Ireland. The national forest estate is expanding in size due to annual afforestation even at the current rates. It is important to note that areas clear felled are obliged to be replanted following harvesting as per licences granted.</p><p>Estimates of projected harvesting are  provided in the recently published COFORD All roundwood production forecast 2021-2040 which is available on the COFORD website <i>WWW.COFORD.ie</i>.</p><p>Statistics for area licensed for felling are as shown in table below, bearing in mind that this felling may not occur in the year in question, as licences may be valid for up to 10 years. It is worth noting that all areas felled are obliged to be replanted.</p><p>It is clear that the area under afforestation has been in decline in recent years.  There are many reasons for this, including lack of farmer engagement. It is my aim to address this in the new Forestry Programme for 2023 - 2027, which is under development. This programme will be the main implementation vehicle for the  Forest strategy. </p><p>The consultation on the new Forestry Strategy is ongoing  with a public attitudes survey and a community engagement survey already completed while bilateral engagement with key stakeholders is nearing completion following widespread engagement.</p><p>Over 3,000 submissions have been received on an online public consultation on the future of forests in Ireland, which closed for submissions on 27th April. All outputs from this consultation will help form the new Strategy and in turn the new Forestry Programme.</p><p>It is our aim that the next Forestry Programme will  be designed to encourage a substantially increased uptake of a wide range of afforestation measures. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Hectares of grant aided forestry planted</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>6,652.02 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>6,252.06 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>6,156.41 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>6,292.81 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>6,499.80 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>5,535.75 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>4,025.48 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>3,549.89 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>2,434.32 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>2,016.48 </td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Area licensed for Thinning (Ha)</th>       <th>Area licensed for Clearfell (Ha)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>  13,390</td>       <td>3,493</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>  15,450</td>       <td>6,564</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>  16,014</td>       <td>  12,012</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>  16,916</td>       <td>  11,583</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>154,397</td>       <td>9,780</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>  26,977</td>       <td>  10,113</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>  25,688</td>       <td>  14,157</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>  47,571</td>       <td>9,626</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>7,605</td>       <td>  11,870</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>  12,494</td>       <td>  20,709</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

However, this process was found to be cumbersome and ineffective in practice and was amended with effect from 1st January 2015.</p>  <p>  While only the person acquiring ownership of an equine animal is currently required to sign a declaration confirming the change of ownership data, both parties to the transaction have responsibilities in ensuring that the provisions of S.I. 201 of 2016 are complied with. In this regard, the person who transfers ownership of an equine to another person must present the passport issued in respect of the animal to the new owner at the time of transfer. Both parties must also maintain a record of the transaction for a period of 5 years and these records must be made available for inspection by an authorised officer, on request.</p>  <p>  S.I. 201 of 2016 clearly provides that a person shall not furnish information that is false, misleading or incomplete when making a declaration for the purpose of changing the ownership of an equine animal. As with other requirements in this legislation, this is a penal provision to which section 36(4)(b) of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 applies. </p>  <p>  While there are no immediate plans to change the current legislation on identification of equines, my Department's policy is to regularly review existing legislation with a view to improvement and evolution.</p></reply>

However, I am acutely aware of the pressures that farmers are under at present, arising from rapid increases in input costs. </p>  <p>  Fixed price contracts are a commercial decision between dairy co-ops and their suppliers, and indeed can be an appropriate risk management tool for suppliers to guard against times of high volatility in milk prices. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the unprecedented increase in input costs is creating particular difficulties for dairy farmers who have a significant share of their milk supply locked into fixed price contracts currently. I am pleased to see the recent move from many of the dairy Co-ops who have responded by increasing the price paid to farmers on existing fixed milk price contracts with an additional supplementary payment in response to increasing production costs. </p>  <p>  I emphasise that it is not within my remit as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to intervene in commercial arrangements between supplier and purchasers. I am also aware that contractual arrangements will exist at other points of the supply chain. </p>  <p>  However, I will continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on the significant challenges arising from the illegal invasion of Ukraine. My Department will continue to monitor the market situation for dairy and other agri-food commodities. </p></reply>

It also included an &ldquo;Evaluation of income stabilisation&rdquo;, including consideration of a deposit-type scheme. The Minister for Finance decided not to introduce such a  measure at the time.</p>  <p>  Income averaging for farmers is an important agri-taxation measure and it assists in addressing income volatility. It allows farmers to pay tax based on the average of the preceding five years farming profits and losses. </p>  <p>  As an additional support, farmers may also elect to temporarily step-out of averaging for a single year, for example where market returns are particularly bad and cashflow does not support the payment of an average year&rsquo;s tax. The tax payable for that year is based on actual profits for that year, with the tax due on the average profits deferred.</p>  <p>  The current Programme for Government contains a commitment to consider further taxation measures to manage evolving issues such as market volatility and this will be kept under review.</p>  <p>  My Department recently considered this issue in the context of developing the CAP Strategic Plan and the role of direct payments and measures such as support for producer organisations and the Knowledge Transfer Programme, which provides financial management training, were identified as helping farmers to manage income volatility. </p>  <p>  My Department also funds loan schemes, such as the Future Growth Loan Scheme and the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, which also assist Irish farmers with access to finance and support in times of volatility. </p></reply>

The aid provided for was granted as a measure supporting agricultural markets following the transfer of funds from the reserve for crisis in the agricultural sector. </p>  <p>  The exceptional aid allocation to Ireland was  &euro;15.8 million in EU funding and there are detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this allocation; set out in Commission Delegated Regulation 2022/467 of 23rd March 2022.</p>  <p>  On 13th April, I announced the Government's approval for exceptional aid supports of &euro;15.8 million for the pig and horticulture sector, which will be funded from Ireland's EU allocation for exceptional adjustment aid. The approval was for &euro;13 million for the pig sector and &euro;2.8 million for the horticulture sector to support &lsquo;high-wire&rsquo; protected glass house producers of tomatoes, cucumber and peppers, field vegetable producers, mushroom producers and commercial apple producers.</p>  <p>  EU countries are required to notify the Commission of the measures to be taken before 30 June 2022 and to pay the supports by 30th September 2022. My officials are developing the schemes at present and it is envisaged that payments will be made as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In addition to this use of the EU exceptional aid provision, and in acknowledgement of the need to address the multiple impacts of the illegal invasion in Ukraine on food supply chains and food security, significant funding has already been allocated towards Exchequer funded measures including a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector, and the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme. </p></reply>

Their core objective is to achieve a social, societal, or environmental impact. Like other businesses, social enterprises pursue their objectives by trading in goods and services on an ongoing basis. However, surpluses generated by social enterprises are re-invested into achieving their core social objectives.</p>  <p>  Historically, the lack of concrete data has impeded efforts regarding the provision of supports for, and raising awareness of, social enterprise. Reliable evidence is a prerequisite for effective public policy.</p>  <p>  Following a competitive tender process, a consortium led by Am&aacute;rach Research in collaboration with Social Enterprise Republic of Ireland (SERI) and the Irish Local Development Network (ILDN), have started work on a baseline data collection exercise of social enterprise in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department has budgeted a total of approximately &euro;100,000 +VAT for this data gathering exercise, and has expended approximately &euro;40,000 +VAT to date.</p>  <p>  My Department consulted with a number of organisations and Government Departments, including Benefacts, as part of a scoping exercise in advance of the tender. The National Social Enterprise Policy Implementation Group, which includes a number of Government Departments, social enterprise networks, practitioners and support organisations, was also consulted during the process. Members of the Higher Education Institutes Social Enterprise Network were also consulted. A Technical Advisory Group which includes the CSO, Pobal, researchers and other relevant stakeholders was established to review and provide observations on the process or methodology during its development. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was not consulted directly. </p>  <p>  The baseline data collection exercise will identify key data such as the total number of social enterprises in Ireland, their regional spread, the primary sectors they are active in, their staffing levels and traded income. This is an opportunity to establish a reliable evidence base necessary for future policy development and delivery, which will benefit the sector. I am pleased to see that all social enterprise networks and support organisations are engaging in the project and it is progressing well.</p></reply>
