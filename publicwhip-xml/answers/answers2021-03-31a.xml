This includes supporting my engagement with the Prime Minister of the UK and with the heads of the devolved administrations. </p>  <p>  The Division also supports the work of the Cabinet Committee on Brexit and Northern Ireland, as required.  </p>  <p>  There are five staff in the Britain and Northern Ireland Division, headed by an Assistant Secretary General who is also responsible for the Shared Island unit, which was established in my Department in September last year. </p>  <p>  The Shared Island unit currently has four members of staff with further appointments planned. The unit is tasked with driving and coordinating implementation of the Shared Island initiative as a whole of Government priority.  </p>  <p>  On 22 October, I set out the Government&rsquo;s vision and priorities on Shared Island in an online event at Dublin Castle. In Budget 2021, the Government announced the Shared Island Fund, with &euro;500m being made available out to 2025, ring-fenced for Shared Island projects. This provides significant, new capital funding for strategic investment in collaborative North/South projects that will support the commitments and objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government will work in partnership with the Northern Ireland Executive and with the British Government to progress existing and new cross-border investment projects. The Government&rsquo;s priorities for such investment are set out in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Progressing cross-border investment projects was a key focus of our discussions at the North South Ministerial Council Plenary on 18 December, and in December, over &euro;6m in funding from the Shared Island Fund was approved by the Government to launch the delivery of Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal. </p>  <p>  As part of the Shared Island initiative, the unit is progressing a comprehensive research programme, working with the National Economic and Social Council, ESRI and other partners, with research outputs being published through 2021 and in subsequent years. Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South are key objectives of this work.</p>  <p>  I have also launched the Shared Island Dialogue series to foster constructive and inclusive civic dialogue on a shared future on the island. So far, three dialogues have been held: </p>  <p>  - I addressed a Dialogue with young people on 26 November, on the theme of &ldquo;New Generations and New Voices on the Good Friday Agreement;</p>  <p>  - On 5 February, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications participated in a Dialogue on climate and environment on the island; and,</p>  <p>  - On 25 March, a Dialogue on civil society engagement on the island was held, with participation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>  <p>  The Dialogue series will continue through this year, including a focus on Health, Education and Economy, and on civic provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  Finally, on local authority engagement, I warmly welcome the increased focus and ambition for cross-border cooperation at local authority and regional levels, including through the Dublin Belfast Economic Corridor launch on 24 March, the framework of regional priorities of the Irish Central Border Area Network also launched on 24 March, and the North West Regional Development Group&rsquo;s recently agreed statement of updated regional priorities.</p>  <p>  I and a number of Government Ministers have engaged directly with these important cross-border initiatives in recent weeks to affirm the Government&rsquo;s support for their work and readiness to collaborate with them, taking account of overall regional development strategies and the commitments and objectives on the Shared Island initiative that are set out in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The Shared Island unit in my Department, is actively engaging with Local Authorities and the cross-border Local Authority forums in follow up.</p></reply>

Prior to being appointed Taoiseach, I met with victims and the families of victims of the Glenanne gang. What the Glenanne gang did was the worst possible manifestation of evil by any gang, perpetrated on innocent people.  </p><p>However, due to restrictions related to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic an opportunity for such a meeting has not yet arisen. I hope to meet these families as soon as circumstances allow. </p><p>I have  been clear that all victims and survivors of the Troubles deserve access to truth and justice. It is why it is vital that we put in place a comprehensive framework to address all cases. </p><p>The Stormont House Agreement framework is the way forward on these issues. It was agreed by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it must be implemented. </p><p>The Government is committed to working with the UK Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to address the painful legacy of the Troubles. We will do this as agreed through the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement framework, in order to support wider societal reconciliation, build greater community confidence in policing and meet the legitimate needs of victims and survivors in Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland.</p><p>We will continue to press the British Government on the implementation of the agreed, collective, framework.</p><p>Only through a collective approach can we hope to deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly, and in a way that responds to the needs of victims and survivors, and society as a whole. </p></reply>

All the participants reaffirmed their shared commitment to the ongoing implementation of the New Decade, New Approach agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to work with the UK Government, with the Northern Ireland Executive and through the North South Ministerial Council to ensure that the New Decade, New Approach  agreement is implemented in full.</p></reply>

The Assembly adapted its methods to comply with Public Health Guidelines and is expected to report by June 2021.  </p><p>Consideration is being given to all possibilities with regard to methodology for future Citizens' Assemblies, but any decisions in this regard will be guided by the experience of the current Assembly.  An independent researcher has been appointed to monitor and record, amongst other things, the perceived deliberative quality of the Assembly, which will also assist in decisions on future Assemblies.</p><p>Under the Programme for Government, the Government aims to establish a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly in 2021 to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.  This Assembly will be established with a new Chairperson and new members following completion of the current Assembly.  </p><p>The Programme for Government provides for establishment of Citizens' Assemblies to consider biodiversity; matters relating to drugs use and the future of education.  Officials from my Department are engaging with officials from the relevant Departments on the approach to be taken with regard to these Assemblies.  It is envisaged that they will be established after the Dublin Mayor Citizen's Assembly has completed its work, but the specific timing of each Assembly has yet to be worked out.</p><p>Citizens&rsquo; Assemblies do very valuable work in guiding policy and giving a sense of the<font color="#004080"> </font>direction the public would like Government to take, however, they take time to set up and run, especially in these times of pandemic.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.39.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100073#WRB00500"><p>The purpose of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit scheme is to provide targeted support to businesses within the hospitality sector whose operations are likely to be most affected by continued restrictions on public health grounds.  Under the relevant legislation, the scheme is due to expire at the end of next month. </p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 59,172 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 25 March 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;9,722,399, and the potential tax cost is &euro;1,944,480, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. As at 25 March, 3,145 service providers have registered for the scheme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted.   Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.  </p>  <p>  Decisions on next steps relating to the scheme have yet to be taken. However, I would make the point that Stay and Spend should not be viewed in isolation from the other significant measures put in place to support businesses generally, including the hospitality sector. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary but important measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity.   It will apply until 31 December 2021.  It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality. </p>  <p>  Also, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond. I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as announced by Government last month, the scheme is being extended in its enhanced form to the end of June 2021.  </p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan. </p>  <p>  Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020. </p></reply>

Also, for the period of restrictions, the turnover of the business must not exceed 25% of its average weekly turnover in 2019 (2020 in the case of a new business). For the purposes of the scheme, a business premises is defined as a building or other similar fixed physical structure from which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. </p>  <p>  The most common reasons for businesses leaving the scheme include circumstances where they no longer meet the turnover test due to changes in trading operations, for example moving to an online or takeaway service, or where they opt not to renew lease agreements on their premises. During March (to date), eleven businesses deregistered from the CRSS.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has also confirmed that 21,600 businesses had registered for the CRSS in respect of 23,900 premises by 25 March 2021 and almost &euro;407 million had been paid to date. Of these, 640 businesses are located in Limerick and have received over &euro;14 million in payments since the scheme commenced.</p>  <p>  Revenue has published detailed statistics on the main COVID-19 subsidy schemes since late March 2020, including the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). These statistics are available on the Revenue website and are updated on a weekly basis. </p></reply>

The support was paid via the employer so as to maintain employment links between the employee and employer insofar as was possible and, to that end, the rate of Employers' PRSI was also significantly reduced to 0.5%.  The level of income given to each individual employee was based on previous wages received in January and February 2020.  Over 66,500 employers received a subsidy under the TWSS with payments worth just under &euro;2.9 billion paid out to a total of 664,000 workers.  </p>  <p>  The TWSS amounts due to be returned from employers (reconciliation balances) arise primarily due to the rapid introduction of the scheme as an emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. For the initial &lsquo;transitional phase&rsquo; from 26 March to 3 May 2020, Revenue operated a simplified process so that employers could be supported as quickly as possible and, as an interim measure, paid employers the maximum subsidy amount of &euro;410 per week in respect of each employee. Revenue provided extensive guidance on how to calculate the correct subsidy amount due and employers made a declaration that they would return any overpayments. Most of the balances now repayable relate to this phase rather than the &lsquo;operational phase, which ran from 4 May 2020 to 31 August 2020. </p>  <p>  Revenue has recently completed the reconciliation between the TWSS subsidy amounts paid to employers in respect of their employees and the actual amounts correctly due and paid to them. From the initial analysis, 41% of employers are in a balanced position, 3% of employers are due additional subsidy payments totalling &euro;1.4m and 56% of employers have reconciliation balances to be repaid, totalling &euro;224 million. Of this sum, approximately &euro;90 million has already been repaid. </p>  <p>  Revenue has at this stage notified most employers of their TWSS balance, other than a small number of more complex cases where calculations are still being finalised. Revenue appreciates that employers will wish to review these figures and ensure that all payments to their employees have been correctly reported. To facilitate these reviews, a period of three months, to end June 2021, is available to examine the data, make any necessary amendments and repay any amounts owing at that point, thereby finalising the reconciliation process.</p>  <p>  Any reconciliation balance owing at end June 2021 may be paid to Revenue in similar manner to a tax liability. However, to ensure that these liabilities do not cause undue hardship to businesses at this difficult time, I introduced measures in the Finance Act 2020 to extend the Tax Debt Warehousing provisions to include any amounts owing in respect of TWSS. Employers not in a position to avail of Tax Debt Warehousing may request a phased payment arrangement from Revenue. Where employers do not avail of the opportunity to finalise matters by end June, Revenue will consider the current reconciliation balance as owing and will collect the outstanding amounts.</p>  <p>  This is a historic issue as the TWSS was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.  The EWSS operates differently to the TWSS and is not included in the reconciliation process.</p></reply>

However, in relation to tax-based measures for retrofit projects, my officials considered such a measure in the context of a Tax Strategy Group paper in 2019. That paper was published with the Budget 2020 documentation. In brief, it was found that there could be a duplication of supports with the direct SEAI grant system already in place and that a scheme such as this could conflict with the overarching need to increase overall housing supply.  </p>  <p>  The paper also observed that:</p>  <p>  - In terms of current direct expenditure measures in the energy efficiency sector, the Government continues to make grants available to householders who wish to improve the energy efficiency of their home through the SEAI&rsquo;s Better Energy Homes (BEH) and Deep retrofit Grant programme.</p>  <p>  - Research undertaken by the ESRI into householder preferences regarding retrofit subsidy schemes found that households strongly prefer cash payment subsidies (i.e. up-front discounts or cash back post works) versus other indirect methods of financial support such as tax credits).</p>  <p>  - From an equity perspective, tax expenditure measures can be regressive by nature, given that only those who pay taxes qualify, and those with greatest income benefit the most. As such, a tax incentive measure as proposed may be of little benefit to certain groups who are most likely to suffer from energy poverty, for example the elderly or those on limited incomes. The Home Renovation Incentive (the tax measure on which the proposal was based) expired on 31 December 2018 following an ex-post analysis of the scheme. The review found that in the context of the current housing supply shortage, and the need at that time to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there was a risk that the retrofit scheme could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The review concluded that the potential for displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations would create a high opportunity cost of labour associated with HRI which was not present at the inception of the scheme. Given the continued constraints on the construction sector&rsquo;s ability to deliver a supply of new housing units, similar issues may arise with regard to the introduction of this proposed tax based measure.</p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, the introduction of any new tax expenditure measure would take place in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.  It would also be usual that proposals for tax expenditure measures would be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.  Furthermore, I must always be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base and a strong and convincing case for the benefits and outcomes need to be articulated in order for due consideration to be given for the commitment of scarce taxpayer resources for such reliefs.</p></reply>

The introduction of the Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR), will complement these existing powers, ensuring that the Central Bank has the additional powers necessary to provide appropriate regulation.</p>  <p>  The legislation required to provide for SEAR is complex as it gives rise to a number of constitutional issues. Very careful consideration has had to be given to the proposals due to the need to ensure that they are robust and can withstand legal challenge. Officials from my Department have been in ongoing and detailed discussions with the Central Bank and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on the detail of the proposed Bill.</p>  <p>  SEAR will require firms to set out clearly the roles and responsibilities of their senior executives including the production of Management Responsibility Maps documenting key management and governance arrangements in a comprehensive and accessible way. This should ensure that there is clarity as to who is responsible for what.</p>  <p>  The legislation will include Conduct Standards for individuals and firms, giving the Central Bank additional powers to enforce obligations on financial services providers, and relevant individuals working within them, with respect to expected standards of conduct.</p>  <p>  The legislation will also enhance the existing Fitness &amp;amp; Probity Regime and break the &ldquo;Participation Link&rdquo; to facilitate the Central Bank in taking action against either a firm or an individual where a contravention of financial services legislation occurs.</p>  <p>  As work on the various aspects of the legislation is advanced, I will consider how SEAR will be rolled out across the various sectors of the financial services industry but I would expect that the most significant financial sectors would be encompassed by the legislation.</p>  <p>  I intend that the heads of Bill will be drafted and presented to Government before the summer recess. This is subject to the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice on the adequacy of the safeguards included to protect the constitutional rights at stake. </p></reply>

The TWSS is also exempt from PRSI but is liable to income tax and USC.</p><p>The PUP and TWSS were not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in the normal manner in 2020, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was adopted to minimise the impact on employee&rsquo;s incomes and ensure payments reached recipients as quickly as possible. </p><p>Regarding any tax liabilities arising in 2020, including in relation to the PUP and the TWSS, I am advised by Revenue that on 15 January 2021, Revenue made a <i>Preliminary End of Year Statement</i>available to all PAYE taxpayers through its online myAccount facility. The statement provided taxpayers with a preliminary calculation of their income tax and USC position for the year and indicated whether their tax position was balanced, underpaid, or overpaid for 2020.</p><p>However, an employee&rsquo;s income tax and USC position for the year is not finalised until he or she submits an income tax return. The income tax return provides the employee with an opportunity to update any personal record details, declare any additional income and claim additional tax credits or reliefs, such as qualifying health expenses. The employee&rsquo;s annual tax liability is then calculated having regard to the tax rate appropriate to his/her income, including PUP and/or TWSS payments, and the application of all tax credits and reliefs that are correctly due, including Health Expenses. A refund only applies where an excess amount of tax was paid relative to a person&rsquo;s total income and allowable tax credits and reliefs.</p><p>There is no legal basis for Revenue to exclude a source of income from the calculation of a person&rsquo;s tax liability. </p><p>Where a liability for 2020 still exists after taking account of all credits and reliefs, the amount owed can be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing tax credits, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.  </p></reply>

In this regard, the <i>Action Plan on Insurance Reform </i>contains 66 actions across several departmental policy areas. Its implementation is overseen by a Cabinet Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, the most recent meeting of which took place last week. High level achievements to date include: the adoption of<i>Personal Injuries Guidelines </i>by the Judicial Council which significantly reduce many common injury award levels and the creation within the Department of Finance of <i>The Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>.  </p><p>The Deputies will also be aware that last week, the Minister for Justice introduced amendments to the <i>Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill</i>to implement these new Guidelines. As such the guidelines will now be in place ahead of schedule. This means that many claims will begin to be assessed by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) and the judiciary using the guidelines rather than the Book of Quantum. Accordingly, this should mean more consistency and will help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and thereby underscore the benefits of using PIAB.  This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees. </p><p>In addition, I would hope that the improved insurance operating environment will help to attract new entrants into the Irish market, thereby increasing competition. I also strongly believe that this provides an opportunity for insurers to now increase their risk appetite, and extend cover to new market segments or areas they may have previously withdrawn from. </p><p>While the new Guidelines are a major step to reducing the cost of claims for insurers, I reiterate my strong expectation that insurers respond to this key piece of reform in a positive and generous manner by passing on these savings. The insurance industry previously committed to reduce premiums in line with lower award levels. As such, I am meeting the CEOs of the main firms in April to hear how they will meet this pledge.</p><p>In summary, the Deputies can be assured that the Government intends to ensure that all savings from the insurance reform agenda are passed on to consumers.  Other necessary reforms remain important and the Department of Finance will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders, in order to ensure that these begin to deliver a more sustainable and competitive insurance environment to the benefit of all groups in Irish society. </p></reply>

These decisions may have an impact on competition in the banking market and are a reflection of the wider challenges banking is facing, not only in Ireland but also abroad. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the banking sector has been strengthened in recent years through a range of reforms that have improved its resilience to adverse shocks. This resilience has been evident in the lack of any additional amplification of the COVID-19 crisis through the financial sector. These changes have included a large increase in the quality and quantity of loss-absorbing capital on bank balance sheets since the previous global crisis, a reduced reliance on short-term unstable market-based funding, and substantial reductions in non-performing loans. Some facts include:</p>  <p>  - The aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of the domestic banking system stood at 18.2% at end 2020 which is between 2 and 3 times the level in the system in 2008.</p>  <p>  - Domestic lending is now funded primarily through domestic retail deposits, rather than less stable sources of short-term, wholesale financing from abroad.</p>  <p>  - Non-performing loans on domestic banks&rsquo; balance sheets have fallen by 85% since 2014.</p>  <p>  - Total assets of domestic Irish lenders are around &euro;280bn, less than half the 2008 peak.</p>  <p>  Although each of the banks in which the State has a shareholding recorded significant losses in 2020, the second half for the year was an improvement on the first half with both AIB and BOI recording underlying profits. In addition, new lending recovered strongly in the second half of the year.  Despite the significant losses recorded in 2020, the funding and capital positions of the banks remain significantly above regulatory minima leaving them well positioned to manage through the crisis and to support the recovering economy.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding recent announcements in the banking sector, Ireland continues to have an extensive network for banking services, including post offices and credit unions that are spread right across the country in addition to the bank networks.</p>  <p>  Revised Central Bank lending regulations were enacted on 1 January 2020 which materially expanded the lending capacity of the credit union sector, including for mortgage and SME lending. The sector had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of &euro;344 million at end 2020.</p>  <p>  There is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch. In addition, An Post offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches.  Bank of Ireland has announced that it is following suit.</p></reply>

With a value of almost &euro;38 billion, or nearly a fifth of national income (GNI*), the budgetary support provided by Government has been extraordinary.  A range of measures were put in place by Government to support people and businesses most affected by the financial shock of the pandemic.  These include the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) and Tourism Business Continuity scheme have also been established in order to support those businesses most at risk, with significant cost to the exchequer. Other schemes which have been established include the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) and the Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS), both of which are targeted at supporting the commercial live performance sector. </p>  <p>  It is entirely appropriate that we have acted to support the economy in this way. The current crisis is a once-in-a-century event. The fundamentals underlying our economy are strong. We started this crisis from a position of strength &ndash; a budget surplus, cash reserves and significant progress in lowering our debt. Therefore, public finances can absorb this shock, letting debt rise on a one-off basis in order to provide support to the economy.   </p>  <p>  We are committed to restoring the public finances to a sustainable trajectory and ensuring that Ireland does not become a fiscal outlier as we emerge from the pandemic period. It is expected that economic growth will do much to boost taxes and restore the public finances to a sustainable setting.  Once the public health situation allows, pandemic supports must also be unwound in an appropriate and incremental way.   But we must not forget that permanent increases in expenditure must be met by permanent increases in revenue. If the State is to have a larger footprint in the future, this must be paid for.</p>  <p>  We are in a period of unprecedented uncertainty. With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.</p></reply>

The 70% amounts are pre-allocated under a statistical methodology taking into account GDP per capita, population and unemployment. (Article 11(1) (a) and Annex II).

Alongside a number of reforms to these rules since their inception, the Fiscal Compact was introduced in 2013, with the aim of strengthening fiscal governance and reinforcing the SGP. The Fiscal Compact represents one section of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which is an intergovernmental treaty that exists outside of the Stability and Growth Pact. As such, any reform of the Fiscal Compact would not automatically alter the existing rules under the Pact.</p>  <p>  As regards the current application of the EU's fiscal rules, in March 2020, following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact was activated.  The clause allows for a temporary departure from the normal operation of the fiscal rules in a situation where there is a severe economic downturn in the EU. This clause has suspended the regular fiscal requirements in 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  A Communication from the European Commission in March set out their framework for assessing the conditions required in the EU for the clause to be deactivated. This framework suggests a return to pre-crisis levels of economic activity in the EU should be achieved before the deactivation of the clause. Based on the Commission&rsquo;s own 2021 winter forecast, EU GDP is not expected to reach its 2019 level until the middle of 2022. As such, it is expected that the general escape clause will continue to be in place in 2022. </p>  <p>  As regards the broader question of reform of the EU fiscal rules, early last year, the Commission opened a formal review of the legislative packages known as the Six- and Two-pack, including the launch of a public consultation on the operation of the fiscal rules. Discussions around this review were paused because of the pandemic, with the public consultation suspended.  I welcome the confirmation by the Commission in their recent Communication that they intend to relaunch the public debate on the fiscal framework when the recovery takes hold.  My officials and I will actively engage in these discussions. In particular, I support efforts to enhance the transparency, predictability and simplicity of the rules. However, it must be recognised that there are difficult trade-offs involved. This means that finding agreement will be challenging.</p></reply>

As such, my Department does not collect the information being sought. However, in order to help address the question, my officials examined Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for private motor insurance produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  </p><p>In that regard, the most recent data shows that in the ten year period from February 2011 to February 2021, the price level for private motor insurance has increased overall by 12.7 per cent.  However, it is important to note that there was a 65.1 per cent increase from the beginning of this period to July 2016, with a subsequent decline of 31.7 per cent since the July 2016 high point.  The Deputy should note that the CSO does not collect price information in relation to employer and public liability insurance for businesses.</p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that insurance reform is a key priority for the Government.  A Cabinet Sub-Group for Insurance Reform has been established to help drive the reform agenda. In December, the Government launched the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. This sets out 66 actions to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden on business, community and voluntary organisations.  This ambitious plan is heavily front-loaded, with 97 per cent of actions due for completion this year.  A number of key actions have already been delivered, including:</p><p>- New <i>Personal Injuries Guideline</i>to replace the Book of Quantum have been published and will be adopted shortly;</p><p>- An <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market </i>has been established within the Department of Finance;</p><p>- A public consultation on enhancing the role of the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB)</i>has commenced; and,</p><p>- New regulations on solicitors&rsquo; advertising have been introduced.</p><p>While the Action Plan is ambitious, the Government has not set specific targets for reduction in premia. Nonetheless, it is our intention that both the affordability and availability of all insurance types will increase as a result of the implementation of the actions.  Data from both the CSO and National Claims Information Database will assist the Government in tracking the progress of the Action Plan and how it is impacting upon insurance costs.</p><p>In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through both deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a priority issue for this Government.  Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to play a lead role in this policy area.</p></reply>

The Minister of State in my Department, Sean Fleming TD, has credit unions as part of his remit.  </p><p>The Government regularly engages with the sector to discuss its current and future plans.  I met all of the credit union representative bodies in September 2020, the third such meeting during 2020. In addition, Minister of State Fleming met two of the main representative bodies in January 2021 and again in March 2021. Minister of State Fleming has also met with a number of individual credit unions and groups of credit unions since his appointment in July 2020. </p><p>There are a number of commitments set out in Programme for Government, including a review of the policy framework in which credit unions operate. As part of the review, the Department has held extensive engagement with the credit union representative bodies since September 2020 to seek feedback on their key priorities for the sector. In addition, the Department is taking into account work already completed by the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC). The review is now at an advanced stage.</p><p>In terms of delivery of a strong and vibrant credit union sector and supporting and enabling the sector to grow, the following are some recent developments in relation to lending and investment regulations, SME lending, access to finance for retrofit, current accounts and investment in Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). </p><p><b>Review of Lending and Investment Regulations</b></p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years completed reviews of both the lending and investment frameworks to ensure that credit unions operate under a framework that is both tailored and proportionate, to reflect the unique nature of the sector, and to provide flexibility for credit unions who have ambitions to grow.  </p><p>Following introduction of the new lending regulations on 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to approximately &euro;1.1 billion in SME and mortgage loans, with further additional lending capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As at December 2020, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;344 million, an increase of 12% year-on-year.  </p><p>The revised investment regulations took effect on 1 March 2018. Under these regulations, credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including accounts in authorised credit institutions, certain bank and corporate bonds, sovereign bonds and investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to provide social housing.</p><p><b>SME Lending </b></p><p>I very much welcome the recent announcements that nineteen credit unions, supported by ILCU, CUDA and Metamo, have been approved by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. With their local knowledge, credit unions are ideally placed to support the recovery and providing loans to local businesses is a key element of the recovery. Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book.</p><p><b>Access to Finance for Retrofit </b></p><p>As you will be aware, the Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit in Budget 2021. My officials have been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communication, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to support increased credit union participation in green retrofit loan schemes.  </p><p><b>Current Accounts </b></p><p>The Deputies may also wish to note that under the additional services regime set out in the 2016 regulations credit unions can seek approval from the Central Bank to offer additional services such as current accounts and debit cards. 51 credit unions, representing circa 50% of sector assets, currently have approval to provide Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS).</p><p><b>Investment in Approved Housing Bodies</b></p><p>Since 1 May 2018 it has been possible for credit unions to invest in Approved Housing Bodies through a regulated vehicle. I understand that a number projects are being progressed by the sector at present, which will hopefully lead to investment in AHBs.</p></reply>

The current rate of CGT stands at 33% cent for disposals made from 6 December 2012 with a limited number of exemptions and reliefs. </p>  <p>  While Ireland's headline rate of CGT appears high compared with our European counterparts, in order to carry out a fair comparison, account has to be taken of the specific details of various CGT systems in different jurisdictions. This includes examining special rates, and reliefs and exemptions, rather than focusing solely on the applicable headline CGT rates for the purposes of comparison.  </p>  <p>  For example, there are a number of very generous and targeted reliefs from CGT already in existence in the Irish CGT regime including but not limited to the CGT Principal Private Residence Relief, the CGT Revised Entrepreneur Relief, CGT Retirement Relief and as well as relief for certain disposals of land or buildings acquired between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014.   </p>  <p>  In general, the availability of significant reliefs in respect of a particular tax head often requires a higher rate in order to generate an appropriate yield. Conversely, a wider base with fewer exemptions may facilitate a lower headline rate of tax as it applies to a wider set of economic and commercial activities potentially maintaining a more sustainable yield in the longer term. It is also important from a tax policy perspective to maintain stability and certainty in terms of taxation.  </p>  <p>  CGT is subject to ongoing review, which involves the consideration and assessment of the rate and the relevant reliefs and exemptions. CGT policy and legislation is reviewed by the Tax Strategy Group (TSG), as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process, and is considered in the wider tax policy context. Any changes to the CGT regime are considered in the context of the yearly Budget and Finance Bill process.</p></reply>

While the Government remains committed to protecting and strengthening the Ireland-UK relationship following the end of the transition period, I can advise the Deputy that the net impact of Brexit on the policy areas within my remit is anticipated to be strongly negative. </p><p>One area that Ireland has been growing for nearly four decades is the international financial services sector.  The <i>Ireland for Finance </i>whole of government<i></i>strategy 2019<i></i>provides a clear roadmap to maximise any opportunities in the international financial services that may arise as a consequence of Brexit.</p><p>The <i>Ireland for Finance</i>strategy was included in the Programme for Government with action measures built upon the 4 pillars of operating environment, technology and innovation, talent, and communications and promotion.  </p><p>The Government and the State Agencies, such as the IDA, continue to work to fully deliver on any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland as an English-speaking committed EU member State. As such we have unfettered access to the EU Single Market, continued access to EU talent and that of the Common Travel Area. In addition, our pro-business environment is underpinned by a strong and fully-independent financial services regulator.  </p><p>The nature, scale and complexity of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector is changing in a number of ways. This is as a result of the financial services investments won in recent years, including those firms relocating from the UK as a result of Brexit and those looking to set up operations in the EU for the first time. The financial services industry in Ireland has become broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than previously. </p><p>The full impact of Brexit for the industry in Ireland may not be fully realised for some years. At present, firms are establishing the foundations of a new or significantly expanded presence in Ireland, creating a platform for future growth opportunities in all sectors: insurance, banking, and investment management. </p><p>Since the Brexit referendum in the UK, we can point to the success of Barclays and Bank of America in banking plus the many investment firms who have chosen Ireland, as their European base, such as Legal and General, and Aberdeen Standard. Three of the largest market infrastructure players in their respective markets have made Ireland their post Brexit location for their European business, namely Refinitiv, EquiLend, and DTCC. The Standard Club and North P&amp;amp;I Club both marine insurers are establishing operations here.  Kroll/KBRA became the first ratings agency to announce that its EU HQ location would be in Dublin and this was followed by S&amp;amp;P&rsquo;s announcement in December 2017 that Dublin would become its EMEA HQ.</p><p>Thus overall, while it is only a few months into the post-Brexit era, it is clear that Ireland is increasingly being considered as a location of choice for many financial services firms.</p></reply>

Furthermore, in relation to those banks in which the State has a shareholding interest, this commercial independence is specifically provided for in a legally binding "Relationship Framework" document which states that each bank continues to be a separate economic unit with independent powers of decision making and that it is the respective boards and management of each bank that determines its commercial policies and conducts its day-to-day operations. I am, therefore, precluded as Minister for Finance from any involvement in the commercial and day-to-day decisions of such a bank and accordingly it will not be possible or appropriate for me to intervene with individual banks on this particular matter.  However, as the relevant Minister, it is open to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to engage with any person or entity that he considers to be necessary or desirable in relation to the implementation of the scheme to support impacted households.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to create an office<i>tasked with encouraging greater competition in the Irish insurance market.  </i>As part of the Action Plan on Insurance Reform, launched last December, an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, chaired by Minister of State Fleming, was established in my Department.  </p><p>The Office has met on a number of occasions since its establishment.  At its most recent meeting on 22 March, the Office agreed its work programme, which was published on its website ().  This work programme consists of four broad themes: Promotion; Transparency / Information; Engagement with relevant Competent Authorities, and Innovation.  Minister of State Fleming will report its progress on a regular basis to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment Sub-Group on Insurance Reform.</p><p>Since its establishment, the Office has also held a number of meetings with several important stakeholders, including representatives of the insurance industry and business groups, such as Insurance Ireland and the Alliance for Insurance Reform, as well as representative of civic society including: Age Action; the Consumers Association; Union of Students in Ireland; and the National Youth Council of Ireland, to discuss consumer empowerment, and increasing the provision of relevant information.  It has also had useful discussions on how other state regulators try to encourage competition in their respective sectors, including: ComReg; the Health Insurance Authority; and the Commission for Utilities Regulation.  Similarly, the Office also had preliminary discussions with the Central Bank on promoting competition and switching and will engage with them further on these issues.  </p><p>In conclusion, I believe that this Office is an important element of the Government's ambitious insurance reform programme and that it will employ a strategic approach to the promotion of insurance competition, including encouraging transparency and championing the provision of information in relation to the insurance market and available products.</p></reply>

Under the Act lenders are obliged to report personal and credit information to the CCR for loans of &euro;500 or more, and are obliged to seek a credit report in respect of loan applications for &euro;2,000 or more.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank advises that the submission of information to the CCR was implemented on a phased basis, commencing with consumer loans (credit cards, mortgages, personal loans and overdrafts) on 30 June 2017.  In March 2018, moneylender loans, local authority loans and business loans were added.  Finally, hire purchase, PCP and similar type finance were added in June 2019.  Lenders commenced reporting factual information from the relevant date for each product type.  Any credit performance history that pre-dates these implementation dates is not included on the CCR.  </p>  <p>  The submission of information to the CCR must be consistent with the credit arrangements agreed and in accordance with lenders obligations under the Credit Reporting Act 2013, and this may include details in respect of restructures if agreed by the parties.  For active loans (ones where payments are being made, or are expected to be made), lenders will be provided with performance data for the most recent 24 months on a credit report.</p>  <p>  For a closed loan (one where all payments have been discharged, or the loan closed off by the lender), a lender will see the final two years of payment performance information.  When the oldest information reaches five years old, each separate entry will be deleted month by month thereafter. The closed loan information will be completely removed from the credit report five years after the last payment was made.</p>  <p>  The CCR produces credit reports based on factual information submitted by lenders.  It does not comment on the payment history, or provide any opinion on the content of the credit report, or provide guidance or instruction as to how a lender should interpret or act based on the content of the report.  Also, the CCR does not produce credit scores or ratings.  The CCR does not decide or determine if a credit application is approved or not; that is and remains a commercial decision of the lender considering the credit application. </p>  <p>  In relation to the ICB, that is an independent commercial entity and is outside the remit of the Central Bank.  However, if a person is of the opinion that data held on the ICB is not accurate or up to date that person can make a complaint to the Data Protection Commission.  </p></reply>

In particular, consumer-facing services sectors have been significantly impacted. Unfortunately, many of these sectors have a higher proportion of lower-paid employees, and those working on a part-time basis.</p><p>This was reflected in the Exchequer figures for 2020, which showed income tax down by only 1 per cent on 2019. This remarkable resilience is a testament to the highly progressive nature of our tax system, which places many of these works outside of the income tax net. The Government has acted decisively to support these workers, through initiatives such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Covid Restrictions Subsidy Scheme as well as a range of additional supports to households and businesses. The suite of measures that the Government has introduced are focussed on supporting businesses in retaining employment, providing support to those out of work, and on getting people back to work as soon as possible.</p><p>The most recently available data, to March 22<sup>nd</sup>, shows that 449,500 people are being supported by the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, with the figures particularly high in the severely affected accommodation, food and retail sectors. Revenue data to March 25<sup>th</sup>shows that an additional 311,500 employees are being supported by the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme, and that 21,300 businesses have registered claims under the Covid Restrictions Subsidy Scheme.</p><p>These figures highlight the deep effect that Covid-19 has had on our economy and labour market, but also the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to provide the necessary fiscal support to cushion the worst impact of the pandemic on our society.</p></reply>

However, the new agreement still represents a break from previously existing arrangements, and thus a permanent shock to the Irish economy. Therefore, Brexit will still have a negative economic impact on the Irish economy and living standards compared to the previous relationship.</p>  <p>  For Irish exporters, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement is positive, compared to a no-deal scenario, as it will provide for zero-tariffs and zero-quota trade for qualifying EU and UK goods. However, it is important to note that the agreement does not completely mitigate against trade frictions in the form of non-tariff barriers, such as customs checks and procedures. So, while tariffs and quotas have been avoided for qualifying goods, non-tariff measures or non-tariff barriers represent a change in trading relations and an increased cost to trade. In addition, disturbances to retail and distribution supply chains could have a direct impact on Irish consumers through reduced competition and higher prices. Further import controls will be introduced by the UK, on a phased basis from October 2021, on certain categories of EU goods, including plant and animal products.  </p>  <p>  The Government has put in place extensive financial supports for sectors over recent years to assist businesses prepare for and mitigate the impacts of Brexit, including various financial, advisory, and upskilling supports. The Government has also invested heavily in our port infrastructure, as well as working closely with businesses to navigate the new customs arrangements.   A range of Government support is available to Irish exporters, including training and grants, to help businesses deal with these changes. It is vital that business prepare for the further changes which will arise over the coming months due to the UK&rsquo;s new import controls.</p>  <p>  The successful negotiation of the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland, as part of the Withdrawal Agreement, delivered key economic objectives for Ireland. The Protocol secures Ireland&rsquo;s place within the Single Market, avoids a hard border on the island, protects the all-island economy, and provides Northern Ireland with unique access to both the British internal market and the EU single market.</p>  <p>  In the weeks since the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, a level of trade friction has been evident. Given the phased basis of the new import controls which are being applied by the UK, it will take time for these to feed through to overall exporting activity, and to assess any associated economic impact. </p>  <p>  The Government remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples&rsquo; livelihoods to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

This Action Plan contains a range of deliverables across a number of Government policy areas, including the Department of Finance, which aim to improve the insurance environment in Ireland. The Plan is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which is chaired by an T&aacute;naiste. The sub-Group met last week and took stock of the considerable progress that has been made in the first three months of the Plan. </p><p>In terms of the actions attributable to my Department, the Minister of State Sean Fleming TD has primary responsibility for delivery and the key achievements to date include:</p><p>- Establishing a new <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>; </p><p>- Working with the Central Bank of Ireland to expand the scope of the <i>National Claims Information Database (NCID)</i>to now gather data on employer and public liability insurance;</p><p>- Commencing the bulk of provisions under the <i>Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 </i>(with the remainder to take effect from September 2021); and</p><p>- Publishing the <i>Oireachtas Post-Enactment Scrutiny Report</i>in relation to this Act.</p><p>In addition, another key responsibility for my Department is to request from industry and stakeholders an assessment of the expected impact of the reforms upon premium levels.  In this regard, both Minister of State Fleming and I have had extensive engagement with these groups, and this will continue into the future. As the Deputies will be aware, Minister of State Fleming is to shortly meet with the main insurers, particularly in relation to the new Personal Injuries Guidelines. </p><p>Work is also continuing within my Department to progress other key actions due in the coming months. This includes preparing for the publication, by the Central Bank of Ireland, of the first National Claims Information Database (NCID) report on employer and public liability insurance, and the Central Bank&rsquo;s final Review of Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Market.  My officials are also engaging with the officials in the Central Bank to explore options on establishing an insurance databank for new market entrants. </p><p>In addition, another key action for my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, is to set out proposals to regulate claims harvesters.  Officials are currently examining this issue, including how other jurisdictions regulate these type of entities. </p><p>In conclusion, as Minister for Finance, I, along with Minister of State Fleming, am  committed to working with my Government colleagues to achieve a more sustainable and competitive insurance market, and to continue to drive the Action Plan forward.  It is my belief that this whole-of-Government approach provides the best opportunity to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.134.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100074#WRC00800"><p>Since the COVID-19 situation first arose, I have maintained contact with the BPFI and lenders on the measures they have put in place to assist their customers who are economically impacted by the pandemic.  In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit or the drawn down of credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

That strategy aims to stimulate responsible innovation and competition, to enable fintech start-ups to scale up and grow, and ensure that EU financial services rules are fit for the digital age, while managing risks to consumers.  </p><p>The second pillar of the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>strategy is &lsquo;Technology and Innovation&rsquo;; and work continues under that pillar to take advantage of the opportunities that fintech and digital finance may offer. World leading companies are developing new products and services from Ireland for global markets, with an exceptional level of collaboration between industry, academia, state agencies and regulatory authorities driving Ireland's dynamic ecosystem.</p><p>Indeed, the <i>Ireland for Finance </i>strategy builds on the valuable work on fintech achieved under the previous international financial services strategy, <i>IFS2020,</i>as Deputy Murphy will be very familiar with from his time lead on such matters.</p><p>&lsquo;Talent&rsquo; and &lsquo;Communications and promotion&rsquo; are the other two pillars of the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>Strategy and we continue to supply the necessary education for the talent and promote our offering in the fintech space under these pillars. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s offering includes an ecosystem that involves access to EU single market and customers, a strong financial services sector and a strong IT sector, with major global firms in both sectors operating in Ireland, a skilled English-speaking workforce, (including access to talent from the European Union and UK under the common travel area), and a highly regarded educational system. </p><p>We also have an &lsquo;innovation hub&rsquo; run by the Central Bank of Ireland. The Innovation Hub allows fintech firms to engage with the Central Bank of Ireland outside of existing formal regulator/firm engagement processes and is a resource to help innovators navigate the regulatory landscape. The Central Bank wants to hear from firms who are developing or implementing innovations in financial services based on new technologies in order to gain early sight of these technologies and enhance their understanding of potential risks, and importantly, potential mitigants.  </p><p>Further measures in the fintech area are set out in this year&rsquo;s Action Plan under <i>Ireland for Finance &lsquo;Building on Resilience&rsquo;</i>including a new fintech umbrella group set up in the Department of Finance.</p></reply>

The support was paid via the employer so as to maintain employment links between the employee and employer insofar as was possible and, to that end, the rate of Employers' PRSI was also significantly reduced to 0.5%.  The level of income given to each individual employee was based on previous wages received in January and February 2020.  Over 66,500 employers received a subsidy under the TWSS with payments worth just under &euro;2.9 billion paid out to a total of 664,000 workers.  </p><p>The subsidy was based on net pay and tax was not collected in real-time through the PAYE system while the scheme was in operation, and instead would be collected after an end of year review, if any such liability arose. This decision was taken in order to maximise the amount of financial support that was provided to recipients at a time when it was considered that they needed such support most, when the TWSS was first announced and expected to only be in place for 12 weeks.  </p><p>Net pay was the chosen benchmark for the TWSS as the priority was to preserve take-home income of workers insofar as was possible, noting that similar rates of income supports based on previous pay levels were also being provided for those on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) administered by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>When the TWSS was extended for a further 10 weeks until the end of August 2020, Revenue took steps to minimise the amount of income tax and USC due, if any, on TWSS payments at the end of the year.  This was done by placing all recipients of the TWSS or PUP on the &lsquo;<i>week 1 basis</i>&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that arise at year end. </p><p>The Government have been consistent as regards the TWSS&rsquo;s liability to tax from the outset of the payment.  Indeed, I have been advised by Revenue that it clarified the tax treatment of the TWSS at employee level in the guidance material on the TWSS that it has published on its website since the commencement of the Scheme.  Furthermore, Revenue actively engaged in facilitating webinars with the Employer Bodies, Accountancy Firms and Tax Practitioners to explain and clarify any issues for employers as regards the TWSS. For the information of the Deputy, Revenue&rsquo;s material on Frequently Asked Questions on the TWSS can be found at </p><p>The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income for the duration of the scheme.  However, the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, the question of what wages an employer would be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of hours worked and the question of an employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees at pre-COVID levels in the light of the impact of the pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, were matters between the employer and the relevant employees and were outside the remit of the TWSS.  </p><p>An employer who received TWSS payments under the scheme was obliged to pass on any such payments to its employees.  Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing TWSS compliance programme is specifically examining that employers adhered to that requirement, as well as examining employer/employee eligibility for the TWSS.  In addition, I am aware that Revenue has previously publicly stated that for certain employees where their employer paid net weekly earnings of between &euro;586 and &euro;960 pre-COVID, the full amount of the subsidy due to such employees may not have been paid through the payroll process during the period the TWSS was in operation.  The process of identifying those employees who qualify for an additional subsidy is currently in progress.  Revenue intends to offset any additional amount against an individual&rsquo;s outstanding income tax/USC due for 2020, or by way of direct refund if the person has no 2020 arrears. </p><p>Payments made under the TWSS were regarded as income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC).  While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and were instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of 2020. </p><p>Although the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on their personal circumstances based on data that Revenue released in January, it is noted that almost half of those in receipt of the PUP or TWSS have no outstanding liability to discharge (in fact over a third are due a refund).</p><p>In the case of the remaining taxpayer units with an outstanding liability, the data indicates that amounts to be collected are modest in scale, with 44% owing less than &euro;500 and 72% having a liability of less than &euro;1,000. If paid over the 4 year period beginning in 2022, the majority of those cases will owe less than &euro;5 per week, with nearly half paying less than &euro;2.50 per week.  These figures represent a preliminary liability and may be further reduced by additional tax credits or reliefs such as health expenses.  </p><p>Revenue has also given assurances that if any income tax and USC liabilities remain following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities and a number of flexible arrangements may be entered into, including the collection without interest over an extended period of time for 4 years beginning in 2022.  It is also understood that Revenue are facilitating employers who wish to pay the tax liabilities of their employees where such income tax and USC liabilities arise from the scheme.</p><p>Revenue made a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees from 15 January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Social Protection, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement also includes information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement provides employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and indicates whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.</p><p>Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees have an opportunity to complete their income tax return for 2020, declaring any additional income and claiming any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.</p><p>When a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.</p><p>The Preliminary End of Year Statement sets out a provisional tax position for 2020, based on information available on Revenue records, including any Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments reported by the individual&rsquo;s employer.  Revenue published provisional statistics in relation to the preliminary end of year tax position for all PAYE taxpayers for the year 2020, on 14 January 2021 which is available to view on Revenue&rsquo;s website:</p><p> </p><p>I might conclude by noting that Revenue are facilitating employers who wish to pay the tax liabilities of their employees where such income tax and USC liabilities arise from the scheme. Any employers who are in a position to discharge such liabilities on behalf of their workers are encouraged to do so, but it is also acknowledged that, as with the decision around whether to avail of the TWSS in the first place, the question of whether an employer pays the income tax owed by employees in respect of the TWSS is a matter between the employer and the relevant employees.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19.  For those borrowers, lenders are expected to engage with them in an effective way and, in line with the requirements of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Consumer Protection Code and regulations on lending to SMEs, to deliver appropriate and sustainable solutions and facilitate as many borrowers with their debt repayments.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the reintroduction of mortgage payment breaks, the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  My Department maintains ongoing contact with the BPFI and lenders and the BPFI also stated last January that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their particular situation.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that still need support at this time. </p></reply>

Prior to 2015 the scheme was an investor-based relief which provided tax relief to individuals investing in the film industry.  It is my understanding that the Deputies may be referring to a SCOPE ruling relevant to the time when the tax relief was claimed by investors, rather than the film production companies. The scheme was amended as part of Finance Act 2015 and now operates as a corporation tax credit which provides direct support to producer companies.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been reports of industrial relations concerns in the industry and the Deputies will be aware that I have taken steps in recent Finance Acts to address these issues.  Finance Act 2018 amended the section 481 certification process to provide that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, after considering an application and applying a set of tests, may issue a Cultural certificate to a producer company stating that a film is qualifying film for the purpose of the credit. One of these tests relates to employment on the qualifying film. Applicants must complete an &ldquo;Undertaking in respect of quality employment&rdquo;. This undertaking commits applicants to compliance with all relevant employment legislation in relation to the film being certified and it is also requirement to provide information on any adverse decisions of the Workplace Relations Commission against the company or companies within the group.</p>  <p>  The Film Regulations provide for the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to set conditions relating to employment when issuing a certificate for a qualifying film. Regulation 4 of the Film Regulations stipulates that these conditions are to be met by the producer company but also by the qualifying company (a designated activity company wholly owned by the producer company which exists solely for the purpose of making the one qualifying film). Should a producer company or qualifying company fail to adhere to a condition or obligation specified in a certificate, any credit claimed may be subject to recoupment by Revenue.</p>  <p>  In relation to the clawback of the credit, I am advised that Revenue carries out a comprehensive programme of compliance operations each year across a broad range of economic sectors, including the film industry. Many of the operations are carried out on a multi-agency basis, which can include officials from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the Workplace Relations Commission. The primary role of these joint investigation units, JIUs, is to detect non-compliance with tax and duty obligations, which includes non-operation of the PAYE system on foot of bogus self-employment. </p>  <p>  Additionally, I am informed that Revenue are members of the Employment Status Group. As members of this group, Revenue are assisting DSP in updating the Code for Determining Employment or Self-employment. It is envisaged that the new code will be published by Q3 2021.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.156.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100074#WRC03000"><p>I am assured by Revenue that combating the threat which illegal cross&ndash;border trade of all kinds, including that in household fuel products, pose to legitimate businesses, consumers and the Exchequer continues to be a priority. Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against illegal cross-border trade, and also cooperate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. I am assuming that the Deputy, when referring to household fuel products, is enquiring about the movement of home heating oils and solid fuel into the State from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal mineral oils trade, including home heating oils, include the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements, a rigorous programme of risk focused enforcement action and the application of robust legislation. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud. </p>  <p>  In relation to solid fuels, the Deputy will be aware that the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State is enforced by local authorities in the State.  Local authorities have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling coal that does not meet these standards. The collection of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT) is heavily reliant on the effectiveness of this regulatory regime.  </p>  <p>  Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT) is an excise duty that applies to coal and peat when first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to coal coming into the State from Northern Ireland. Solid fuel carbon tax is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis and compliance with the law is enforced using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes.</p>  <p>  Currently, there is no carbon tax on solid fuel in Northern Ireland. This factor, combined with that jurisdiction's lower VAT rate on solid fuel, lower environmental standards and currency fluctuations, can give rise to significant price differentials which incentivises the sourcing of solid fuel from Northern Ireland. EU Single Market constraints, which still apply in Northern Ireland, preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of SFCT. This means that solid fuel coming into the State from Northern Ireland is not subject to cross-border movement controls typical of harmonised excises on mineral oils, tobacco and alcohol. Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel. Similarly, Revenue has no authority to challenge transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland as such transportation or possession are not, in themselves, Revenue offences. Even if controls were possible, a person transporting solid fuel from Northern Ireland could legitimately claim that SFCT will be accounted for on relevant supplies made in the State. An SFCT return does not have to be made until one month after the end of the two-month accounting period in which the supply is made.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of 2020 Revenue participated in a number of &ldquo;joint operations&rdquo; within Low Smoke Zones in conjunction with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communication and local authority solid fuel inspection teams, with a view to checking for compliance across several tax headings, including SFCT. In addition, a SFCT compliance module has been included in Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing Mineral Oil Tax national compliance project. This project, along with many other field-based compliance activities, has been impacted by Covid-19 restrictions since mid-March 2020.  </p></reply>

In Ireland, the debt-to-GNI* ratio rose to around 108 per cent last year. Given the supports required so far this year, this ratio will increase even further.</p><p>Crucially however, the low interest environment that we find ourselves in means that, despite this sharp increase in debt, interest costs are actually falling. This is the case not just in Ireland but throughout Europe. </p><p>There is no doubt that the very large increases in borrowing that have been undertaken were the correct approach. However, we must think about the implications for fiscal policy once we move out of the immediate phase of the crisis. </p><p>Supports will continue for as long as they are needed.  However, permanent increases in expenditure are only possible when funded by permanent increases in taxation. To that end, it is imperative that once the public health situation allows, we begin to roll back the once-off and emergency supports that were put in place in an appropriate and incremental way. The objective will be to close the gap between what the State earns and what it spends.</p><p>While we must return the public finances to a sustainable setting, I anticipate that economic growth will do much of the &lsquo;heavy lifting&rsquo; in this regard. The best way to service the increased debt is to grow the economy. The fundamental strengths in our economy will help us to do that. There will be no return to the austerity measures that were necessary during the last financial crisis. </p><p>We faced into this pandemic on a solid footing, with a strong pre-crisis fiscal position. Two consecutive annual surpluses had been recorded and the debt-to-income ratio had seen a significant downward trajectory over a number of years. This strong pre-crisis position gave us policy options </p><p>Reducing the debt ratio back to lower and safer levels must be a key priority over the medium-term. This will, once again, provide us with options should we face another unexpected shock in the future.</p></reply>

Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.</p><p>This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 is at the discretion of the employer. The value of relief allowed under the Irish system is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers. The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally: at &euro;3.20 per day up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum may be paid tax free. By contrast, the weekly rate in the UK is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum.</p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.</p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home.</p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end. Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.</p><p>Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax which may be viewed at the following link:   </p><p>Finally, the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, commits the Tax Strategy Group to reviewing the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The Tax Strategy Group will take account of the economic, financial and organisational implications arising from the experience of remote working during the pandemic, and assess the merits of further enhancements for consideration in the context of Budget 2022.</p></reply>

In this regard, the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform also </i>commits to examine the forthcoming Central Bank <i>Review of Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Markets</i>and take any appropriate actions as deemed necessary, in light of the final report.</p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Interim Report marks an important milestone in its review of the issue and summarises the initial observations from its ongoing market analysis and consumer research.  This will inform the next phases of its work and I look forward to it being finalised in the coming months.  I note that the Central Bank has stated that differential pricing can be associated with both benefits and costs for consumers. Accordingly, completion of the analysis will be essential in order to ensure a full market perspective, evidence-based conclusions and in turn appropriately calibrated regulatory interventions. In addition, the associated consumer research, which is ongoing, will also provide insights which will be essential to the Central Banks&rsquo;s overall analysis.</p><p>Both Minister of State Fleming and I have repeatedly called on the insurance industry to treat their customers fairly and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  I believe that the insurance industry should now be proactively addressing these concerns.  In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has previously sought the views of the main insurers on differential pricing, and will continue to raise this matter with the industry, including at upcoming meetings in the coming weeks. </p><p>In conclusion, I would note that the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Sector will work to enhance consumer awareness and develop information campaigns, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, about the benefits of switching from and engaging with providers. </p></reply>

It contains no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit or repayment arrangements agreed with borrowers.  Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites. The Central Bank, as regulator, has advised lenders that in their reporting to the CCR, they will need to apply judgement, for example, around whether a restructure has been agreed in response to an identification of financial distress and should be reported as such. </p><p>One of my main concerns is to ensure that SMEs have access to sufficient liquidity, and that access to credit for SMEs is maintained. The Government has announced a range of measures to assist companies deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 restrictions, and to ensure that they have access to sufficient liquidity. These include tax measures, as well as loan schemes available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, to assist SMEs. Throughout the pandemic, the network of Local Enterprise Offices have continued to act as a point of contact for businesses around the country, and they can offer advice and support to small businesses, about how best to proceed and what supports are available to them, further information on COVID-19 supports available to SMEs can be found at .  </p><p>I also announced on the 25 February that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), will now remain in place until 30 June 2021 to support businesses affected by COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>The SME Regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review  was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>As Minister I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that need support. </p></reply>

The Central Bank has already robust enforcement powers which can be applied both to firms and individuals, and these have been enhanced by numerous legislative changes introduced since the financial crisis. These have included both EU legislation transposed into national law, and significant changes in domestic financial services legislation.</p>  <p>  The enforcement action concluded by the Central Bank on 1 March 2021 was taken under the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulations 2007, which govern the provision of investment services in financial instruments. These were strengthened in 2017, and these MiFID II Regulations were supplemented by the Markets in Financial Instruments Act 2018.  </p>  <p>  These Regulations aim to reinforce the rules on securities markets by, among other things, improving the transparency of financial markets, strengthening governance rules for investment firms and stock exchanges, strengthening investor protection and increasing the powers of the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  The Senior Executive Accountability Regime, to be included in the forthcoming Central Bank (Amendment) Bill, is to improve accountability in financial services organisations. It will significantly enhance the Central Bank's existing powers to hold firms and individuals to account for any breaches of financial services legislation, and to impose sanctions, where appropriate.</p></reply>

The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that Ulster Bank&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Irish market must be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of Irish financial services legislation, including the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes of conduct.</p><p>I note that Bank of Ireland's announcement on the 1st of March set out the following key points: </p><p>- The decision to close these branches is in response to changing customer behaviour with a significant acceleration in digital banking.</p><p>- The branches closing are predominately self-service locations which do not offer a counter service.</p><p>- To preserve local access to physical banking for those who want it, the bank has agreed a new partnership with An Post which will allow personal and business customers use their local post office for a range of banking services &ndash; including to withdraw cash and make cash and cheque lodgements &ndash; at no additional cost.  The closing Bank of Ireland branches all have a post office within, on average, less than 500 meters.</p><p>- The bank confirmed that the new partnership with An Post will be available to all Bank of Ireland customers before any branch closes.</p><p>- Furthermore, the bank stated that there will be no closures for six months.</p><p>On staff, Bank of Ireland commented that it will be working closely with all colleagues at these branches and will be setting out a range of options which include relocating to a different branch, moving to a new role in the bank, or voluntary redundancy for those who choose it.</p><p>I have met with representatives from both Ulster Bank and its parent company, NatWest in recent months. My most recent meeting was with Ulster Bank Chief Executive, Jane Howard, on the 19<sup>th</sup>February.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I have engaged with Ulster Bank, its parent company, NatWest and the Financial Services Union (FSU) prior to this announcement. In all of these engagements, I strongly emphasised the importance of timely communication with customers, staff and other stakeholders in relation to strategic decisions regarding Ulster Bank.  I also met with the FSU shortly after the announcement and I have committed to further engagement with the FSU in relation to this issue.</p><p>I understand, that there are approximately 2,800 staff employed some of whom are located in Northern Ireland. Whilst the management of staff matters, including staffing levels, is entirely a matter for Ulster Bank and any counterparty who acquires its business, I would expect all stakeholders to be very sensitive in relation to the needs and rights of staff. This includes full compliance with <i>European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003</i>(TUPE Regulations), and honouring all agreements in place between the bank and staff representative bodies.  In addition, I would expect these entities to engage with staff representative bodies as appropriate.  </p><p>NatWest is in early stage discussions with PTSB and other strategic banking counterparties about their potential interest in certain retail and SME assets, liabilities and operations.  A Memorandum of Understanding which has been signed with AIB regarding certain corporate and commercial loans, signals a potentially important development for the Irish banking sector.  While these are primarily commercial negotiations, the Government is supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for both AIB and PTSB, but more importantly for Ulster Bank&rsquo;s customers, staff and the Irish economy generally. NatWest, PTSB and AIB have confirmed that they will provide further updates to the market as negotiations progress in this regard.  Both sets of negotiations potentially signal significant developments for the Irish banking system.</p><p>However, it must be acknowledged that these decisions may have an impact on competition in the banking market and are a reflection of the wider challenges banking is facing, not only in Ireland but also abroad.  </p><p>Innovations introduced by FinTechs and their increasing market penetration are also reducing traffic into the branch networks run by traditional banks. Competing with online firms while coping with high cost structures is posing a considerable challenge for the traditional full service sector. </p><p>The Irish retail banking system is concentrated with five retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending, and three retail banks accounting for the majority of new bank lending to SMEs. However, price competition is possible even in a concentrated system. </p><p>Notwithstanding the recent announcements in the banking sector, Ireland continues to have an extensive network for banking services, including post offices and credit unions.  In addition, An Post offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches.  Bank of Ireland has announced that it is following suit.</p><p>The Government wants to ensure that the banking and financial system is one which will effectively contribute and support economic growth and employment. Competition in the sector is vital to ensure that businesses and consumers have a range of options available when using financial services and accessing credit.</p></reply>

The milk recording service is an agricultural service and the amounts payable by farmers for this service are chargeable to VAT, in the State, at the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%. EU Member States are entitled to apply the reduced rate of VAT to this service in accordance with the provisions of the EU VAT Directive.</p>  <p>  In relation to the application of VAT to these services, records held by the Revenue Commissioners show that the reduced rate of VAT has always applied to milk recording services supplied to farmers by the Irish Dairy Records Co-op (IDRC), through their local co-ops. However, in June 1993, the Revenue Commissioners met with the IDRC regarding the VAT payable in respect of these supplies and accepted that the IDRC was under the control of the Minister for Agriculture and acting on his behalf. At the time the agreement was reached, the State was not normally considered to be a taxable person for the purposes of VAT. The services provided by the IDRC did not therefore come within the scope of VAT and payments receivable by the IDRC, on behalf of the Minister, were not chargeable to VAT, as was normally the case in relation to services provided by the State. </p>  <p>  Resulting from that meeting, an agreement was reached between Revenue and the IDRC that, of the amount payable by farmers to their local co-op in relation to milk recording, two thirds related to payments collected on behalf of the IDRC (and therefore on behalf of the State) and were not chargeable to VAT. The balance of the payments, being payments in return for separate services, identified as being provided by the co-ops to its members in connection with milk recording, were chargeable to VAT at the reduced rate.</p>  <p>  The agreement in place therefore was not that there was a special rate of VAT applicable to milk recording services, but that only a proportion of the milk recording payments (one third) constituted payment for a taxable supply of services. In this regard, taxing one third of the full payment at the reduced rate of VAT is equivalent to taxing the full payment at one third of the correct VAT rate applicable, i.e. one third of the reduced rate of VAT, 13.5% being 4.5%.</p>  <p>  Subsequent to the agreement between the IDRC and Revenue, the commercial arrangements for the provision of milk recording services changed and these services were no longer supplied by the State through the IDRC. Revenue was not made aware of those changes at that time. As a consequence of the changes, the full payment for these services became chargeable to VAT at the reduced rate of VAT, being services provided in full by private taxable persons. Revenue engaged with the suppliers of these services and accepted that the correct VAT treatment could be implemented from 1 January 2020. It should be noted that if these services had continued to be supplied by the State the matter of whether or not they would be considered taxable supplies would need to be reviewed in light of changes in VAT legislation, introduced in 2010, regarding the treatment of the State as a taxable person for VAT purposes. </p>  <p>  There are no provisions in the VAT directive, which would permit a rate of VAT of 4.5% to apply to milk recording services. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that farmers may register for VAT or be treated as flat-rate farmers for VAT purposes. Farmers who elect to register for VAT have an entitlement to reclaim VAT on costs, including the cost of milk recording services, incurred in relation to their farm business; if they remain unregistered they are entitled to apply a flat-rate addition to their supplies to VAT registered businesses. The flat rate addition compensates farmers at the aggregate level for the VAT borne on input costs, including milk recording costs.  </p></reply>

In addition, we continue to work with our fellow EU Member States, and have agreed and implemented an unprecedented number of Directives on tax cooperation in recent years which have been highly successful in addressing aggressive tax planning.</p>  <p>  At the domestic level, a succession of significant measures have been introduced in recent years on Corporation Tax, and this work continues. Budget 2021 contained revisions to Ireland&rsquo;s capital allowances for intellectual property in order to ensure such assets are fully within balancing charge rules in line with international best practice for such reliefs in other jurisdictions. Finance Act 2020 introduced certain legislative defensive measures which provide that Ireland&rsquo;s Controlled Foreign Company rules apply more strictly to companies with subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions that remain on the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  It is worth re-iterating that aggressive tax planning arrangements are not designed by Governments but by advisers, lawyers and business devising complex plans to exploit mismatches or gaps in legislation including between different jurisdictions. Where instances of aggressive tax avoidance emerge, Revenue will rigorously investigate and challenge such cases through the various anti-avoidance legislative provisions available to them.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, in January, I published an update to the Corporation Tax Roadmap. This update takes stock of the significant actions we have taken to date, reflects on the global tax reform work at the OECD at what is a crucial moment, and sets out the next steps in the ongoing process of modernising and further strengthening our corporation tax system, to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the modern economy.</p>  <p>  I have considered the Deputy&rsquo;s request, but I believe that the systematic approach we are taking is the best way of continuing to ensure that all companies pay the appropriate level of tax, and ensure that the tax system meets the needs of the modern economy. </p></reply>

The Governing Council expects net asset purchases to run as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.  On 12 March 2020, the ECB Governing Council decided to add &ldquo;a temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of &euro;120 billion&rdquo; under the APP until the end 2020.  The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.  On 11 March 2021, the Governing Council took a decision, along with other changes, that purchases under the PEPP over the next quarter would be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of this year.</p>  <p>  PEPP is a non-standard monetary policy measure initiated in March 2020 to counter the serious risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.  PEPP is a temporary asset purchase programme of private and public sector securities.</p>  <p>  The Governing Council decided to increase the initial &euro;750 billion envelope for the PEPP by &euro;600 billion on 4 June 2020 and by &euro;500 billion on 10 December 2020, for a new total envelope of &euro;1,850 billion with net purchases to run until at least March 2022. The Governing Council will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. </p>  <p>  For both programmes, the benchmark allocation across jurisdictions is the Eurosystem capital key of the national central banks.  </p>  <p>  Under the PSPP, cumulative net purchases of Irish government bonds amounted to &euro; 4,342 million over the last twelve months (period covering March 2020 to end-February 2021).  Purchases under the PEPP began in March 2020 and cumulative net purchases of Irish government bonds amounted to &euro; 12,123 million as at end-January 2021. </p></reply>

A Memorandum of Understanding which has been signed with AIB regarding certain corporate and commercial loans, signals a potentially important development for the Irish banking sector.  While these are commercial negotiations, the Government is supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for both AIB and PTSB, but more importantly for Ulster Bank&rsquo;s customers, staff and the Irish economy generally. NatWest, PTSB and AIB have confirmed that they will provide further updates to the market as negotiations progress in this regard.  Both sets of negotiations potentially signal significant developments for the Irish banking system.</p><p>Ireland continues to have an extensive network for banking services, including post offices and credit unions that are spread right across the country in addition to the bank networks.</p><p>Credit unions are offer a wide range of services.  They are also authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland to provide a Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS), under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework. 51 credit unions, representing circa 50% of sector assets, currently have approval to provide current accounts and debit cards. </p><p>An Post also offers a range of financial services and products, including counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches.  As part of its announcement about branch closures, Bank of Ireland has also agreed  a new partnership with An Post which will allow personal and business customers use their local post office for a range of banking services , including to withdraw cash and make cash and cheque lodgements, at no additional cost. </p><p>A range of other initiatives are underway that will strengthen the sector and enhance the sustainability, culture and accountability of the banking sector and improve customer outcomes.  These include:</p><p><b>1. The Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR)</b>The Government intends to further enhance the Central Bank&rsquo;s existing powers through new legislation to be introduced in the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>The centrepiece of the new legislation is the Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR), a commitment of the Programme for Government, which seeks to improve the culture of the financial sector and restore public trust in the sector. SEAR is expected to drive positive changes in terms of culture in the financial services industry and enhanced accountability while simplifying the taking of sanctions against individuals who fail in their financial sector roles.</p><p>The proposed legislation will seek to address proposals put forward by the Central Bank arising from the recommendations in its Culture Report which was requested by me on foot of the Tracker Mortgage Examination. </p><p>The legislation is intended to drive greater accountability in the financial sector, raising the standards of expected behaviour for individuals and firms, in order to achieve better outcomes for consumers and improve the sustainability of the financial system.</p><p><b>2. Banking Union</b>Development of the European Banking Union began in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The European Commission pursued a number of initiatives to create a safer financial sector for the Single Market, consisting of a set of legislative texts that are applied to all financial institutions and all financial products across the EU which are designed to ensure that Europe has a safer banking sector which can support the financing needs of the economy. Specifically, its rules include capital requirements for banks, rules for managing failing banks and improved deposit guarantee schemes.</p><p>The completion and improvement of the Banking Union is a priority.  Recently, my Department completed the transposition of the &ldquo;Risk Reduction Measures&rdquo; package of reforms which updated existing rules to keep them in line with standards agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. These reforms included new supports for investments in infrastructure and increased supports for lending to SMEs, revised regulations regarding remuneration practices and a new moratorium power to suspend an institution&rsquo;s payment obligations during a resolution process.</p><p><b>3. Digital Finance Package</b>The European Commission published the Digital Finance Package in September 2020 containing measures developed to further enable and support the potential of digital finance in terms of innovation and competition while mitigating risks.</p><p>The Package contained a number of components &ndash; both legislative proposals and Commission Communications &ndash; including a proposal for a Regulation and Directive on Digital Operational Resilience (DORA), a proposal for a Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and a Commission Communication on a Retail Payments Strategy. </p><p>The suite of measures proposed promotes and enables a more digitalised financial services sector across Europe by regulating emerging technologies such as crypto-assets, evaluating existing legislation such as the Payment Services Directive 2 and the Electronic Money Directive and setting out a framework for a more resilient and stable financial services sector. At the same time, the proposals help to protect consumers in this changing environment.  </p><p><b>4. COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme</b>The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme will ensure ongoing availability of credit throughout the remainder of this year to our vitally important SME sector who are facing the significant challenges of not only COVID-19 but also adjusting to Brexit.  In particular, I welcome the recent expansion in the on-lenders to beyond the retail banks, including 19 credit unions spread between three groups and non-bank lenders.  This extension means that more SMEs will be able to access credit from an increased diversity of sources in both bank and non-bank credit.</p></reply>

If a vehicle is imported from Great Britain into Ireland, the importer is required to complete a customs declaration and pay customs duty, if applicable, and VAT at 23% prior to presenting the vehicle for registration. Under customs law, VAT at import is chargeable on the customs value of the goods. The fact that VAT has been charged in Great Britain on used vehicles subsequently imported into the State has no bearing on their liability to VAT at import when imported into the EU. </p><p>The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which has been provisionally applied since 1 January 2021, has eliminated tariff duties for trade between the EU and Great Britain where the relevant rules of origin are met. If the goods are of UK origin, then a 0% tariff rate applies. It is important to note that the preferential tariff treatment must be claimed on import on the Customs declaration. Details on how to do this are also available on the Revenue website at the following link: </p><p>Under the terms of the TCA, goods of EU origin that were in use in the UK and that were subsequently imported into Ireland from Great Britain are not eligible for the 0% tariff rate as they do not qualify as UK origin under the rules of origin. To import a car of EU origin from Great Britain into Ireland, a customs declaration must be completed. Customs duty of 10% applies on the customs value of the car.

As such, the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform </i>sets out 66 actions across several Government policy areas, including in my Department, to improve the availability of insurance and tackle costs for businesses and consumers. At its most recent meeting, the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which oversees the implementation of the Action Plan, reflected upon the progress made in the first three months. This includes:</p><p>- The creation of an <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market </i>within the Department of Finance.</p><p>- The adoption of new <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines </i>by the Judicial Council.</p><p>- The launch of a public consultation on proposals to reform the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board</i>. </p><p>It is my belief that the impact of these reforms, in conjunction with other strands of the insurance reform agenda, will improve both the cost and availability of insurance for consumers, businesses and voluntary groups. My Department has worked with the Central Bank of Ireland to expand the scope of the National Claims Information Database (NCID) to now include employer and public liability insurance. I look forward to the publication of the first NCID report on employer and public liability insurance this summer, which should bring much greater transparency to developments in these markets. </p><p>Minister of State Fleming and I have had extensive engagement with insurers and other key stakeholders in this policy area, including civic groups and state regulatory bodies. In particular, there has been frequent engagement with both the Alliance for Insurance Reform and Insurance Ireland on several aspects of the Action Plan. Minister of State Fleming is meeting with the main insurers shortly to hear their reaction to the new Personal Injuries Guidelines and to press their previous commitment to reduce premiums in line with lower award levels.</p><p>In conclusion, I can assure the House that we will continue to engage with a wide variety of stakeholders as the Government drives forward the insurance reform agenda that we have developed. I look forward to working with colleagues to implement further aspects of the Action Plan, with a view to achieving a more competitive and consumer-friendly insurance market to the benefit of all of Irish society.</p></reply>

In particular, in respect of mortgages which are secured on a primary residence, regulated entities are required to comply with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and deal with all arrears (and pre-arrears) cases in a sympathetic and positive manner with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower and to deliver appropriate and sustainable solutions and facilitate as many borrowers as possible to return to making loan repayments.</p>  <p>  Borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty should engage early with their lenders, and lenders have specific obligations to support borrowers. Borrowers should consider what they can pay and should be cautious about accruing significant amounts of arrears where it is not necessary.  Lenders must engage with borrowers to identify appropriate and sustainable solutions to a mortgage or other loan difficulty. Lenders should use the full suite of restructuring solutions available to them, including short-term forbearance (and which can include further short-term payment breaks). Borrower circumstances differ, so the right solution for each borrower differs too and borrowers will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Where reporting to the Central Credit Register (CCR) is concerned, lenders are obliged under the Credit Reporting Act 2013, to submit information to the CCR. Submission of information to the CCR must be consistent with the arrangements agreed and in accordance with lenders obligations under the Credit Reporting Act 2013. This may include details in respect of restructures if agreed by the parties.  The CCR produces credit reports, based on factual information submitted by lenders.  However, it does not produce credit scores or ratings, or provide guidance or instructions to lenders on the approach they should take to future applications for credit.  Subject to compliance with all relevant financial services legal and consumer protection requirements, the decision on applications for credit is a commercial matter for the individual lender.  </p>  <p>  Borrowers can get their credit report, free of charge, at www.centralcreditregister.ie and they can also amend information on the CCR if it is inaccurate or not up to-date.  More generally, if a mortgage or other loan applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  In terms of the impact of COVID-19 on mortgages, the Deputy may wish to note that BPFI data indicated that, at the end of 2020, almost 74,000 primary dwelling mortgage payment breaks were provided.  Of these almost 72,000 had expired and almost 89 per of these expired payment breaks had returned to full repayments.  However, I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that still need support at this time.</p></reply>

Central Bank credit union regulations do not place any specific requirements on credit unions that participate in Death Benefit Insurance schemes. The Death Benefit Insurance is provided by insurance undertakings. Some credit unions discharge some or all of the cost of the insurance on behalf of their members, while other credit unions have adopted a member pay approach. </p>  <p>  The Credit Union Act, 1997 is silent on withdrawal of services or the notice to be provided to members by credit unions before the withdrawal of services. However, the Registry of Credit Unions expects credit unions to communicate with their members in a clear and transparent manner, including in circumstances where they intend to amend or discontinue an existing service. The Registry of Credit Unions also expects credit unions to give reasonable notice to affected members in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  Part V of the 1997 Act sets out provisions relating to meetings and resolutions. However, it is silent on motions moved at general meetings. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I recognise the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the Government is determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement. However, it is a commercial decision for individual credit unions to determine whether they decide to offer Death Benefit Insurance or indeed whether they decide to discontinue providing the service. </p></reply>

Minister of State, Sean Fleming TD, has devoted much of his time to overseeing of the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>strategy (which is one of the areas that he has a special responsibility) and its implementation via annual action plans.</p><p>In this context, it is important to note that one of the Minister of State's priorities for 2021 is digital finance (financial technology or 'fintech').  </p><p>The Action Plan is a key instrument for delivering on the international financial services offering, and it is supported by commitments made by industry, central government departments and enterprise agencies (Enterprise Ireland and IDA).  </p><p>This collaboration between our industry stakeholders and the public sector is key to preparing a balanced and effective suite of action measures.</p><p>One of those actions, for example, the Fintech Foresight Group, led by the private sector, will develop proposals to establish better collaboration between 'big tech' in the Grand Canal Innovation District area, tertiary education, new start-ups and venture capital firms.  </p><p>A new fintech group has also been recently established in the Department and in line with this year's commitments under the Action Plan, seeks to coordinate policy across sub-sectors and collaborate with stakeholders in this area.</p><p>Additionally, IDA and EI will continue their successful record of accomplishment in attracting FDIs and export of financial services via numerous policy platforms and promotional activities.</p><p>My Department has been actively involved in the work of the recent EU Digital Finance Package.  This package contains proposals regarding the innovative use of technology in finance, whilst maintaining a level playing field, access to data, financial inclusion and ethical use of data.  For example, the EU legislative proposal on Digital Operational Resilience and proposal on Crypto-Assets aim to mitigate risks for investors while ensuring financial stability.  Developments in this area will ensure that the EU legislation, which will become the operating environment in Ireland in due course, is based on the principle of<i>&lsquo;same activity, same risk, same rules&rsquo;</i>and as such is technology neutral, and fit for the digital age.</p><p>As digital finance accelerates cross borders operations, it also has the potential to enhance financial market integration in the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union, and thereby to strengthen Europe&rsquo;s Economic and Monetary Union.</p></reply>

Its focus is to provide additional liquidity to businesses in a range of sectors. This has resulted in an increased diversification in loan products available to businesses and greater geographical reach for the COVID-19 CGS.</p>  <p>-  While take up of the COVID-19 CGS is less than was foreseen this is due to the significant supports that Government has ensured are available for businesses, including the EWSS, CRSS, tax warehousing and the commercial rates waiver. </p>  <p>-  An extra &lsquo;restart&rsquo; week is payable to qualifying businesses under CRSS the week after the restrictions are lifted as an additional support to them in meeting the costs of reopening.</p>  <p>-  The current tax warehousing schemes allow for the deferral of collection of certain tax liabilities during the period when a business has been unable to trade due to the Covid-19 related restrictions and includes the first full two monthly VAT period after the business resumes trading, and 12 months thereafter. </p>  <p>-  There has been over &euro;810m in lending approved to 7,080 businesses across State-backed loan guarantee schemes.</p>  <p>-  There has been high demand for the Future Growth Loan Scheme and working with the European Investment Fund, this scheme was expanded in the 2020 July Jobs Stimulus and makes up to &euro;800m in lending available to eligible businesses to support long-term, strategic investment, including in response to COVID-19. </p>  <p>-  The SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme makes available working capital loans to help businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the pandemic. These innovations may include adjustments to ensure that a business can continue to operate safely. </p>  <p>  In addition, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently announced that the Small Business Assistance Scheme for Covid is open for applications through Local Authorities. It is available to companies, self-employed, sole traders or partnerships with a minimum turnover of &euro;50,000 and not eligible for the CRSS, F&aacute;ilte Ireland Business Continuity Scheme or the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media&rsquo;s Live Performance Support. </p></reply>

This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by my Department in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.  The report notes that the Exchequer costs and risks involved would not be justified by the analysis of the causes and extent of market failure. The report also notes concerns over the ability of a new State owned bank to provide effective competition.</p>  <p>  While Indecon&rsquo;s report concluded there are some areas of market failure, it noted that there is extensive provision of and access to banking services through bank branches, credit union offices and An Post branches, as well as a wide range of Exchequer funded existing supports.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding recent announcements in the banking sector, this continues to be the case.</p>  <p>  The Indecon report looked at the credit union sector, and concluded that credit unions are considered to be a &lsquo;community bank&rsquo;.  The Government is supportive of the Credit Union movement growing as a key provider of community banking in the country.</p>  <p>  The report also looked at An Post, noting that it was increasing its financial offerings and that there is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within five kilometres.  An Post offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches.  Bank of Ireland has announced a new partnership with An Post to provide a range of banking services.</p>  <p>  There are a wide range of models in the delivery of financial services in the State.  These are being augmented all of the time, particularly in the area of online and phone app banking services. Complementing these wide range of models, we have huge diversity in the ownership of firms delivering retail services.  Ownership ranges from shareholders, both domestically and internationally in the case of credit institutions and retail credit institutions, to community ownership in the case of credit unions.</p></reply>

The proposal as published provides significantly greater flexibility to all Member States to apply reduced rates. The current system (in Annex 3 of the Directive) operates a set list of goods and services to which a reduced rate may apply. The new proposal allows Member States to apply lower rates to a wider set of goods and services but introduces a list of goods and services which must be charged at the standard rate &ndash; a &ldquo;negative list.&rdquo; The purpose of the negative list is to ensure the application of a standard rate to supplies where there may be a risk of distortion of competition.</p>  <p>  This proposal remains under discussion at Working Party level.</p></reply>

The regulations require that investments by credit unions in Tier 3 AHBs must be made through a regulated investment vehicle. The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of a credit union's regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of a credit unions regulatory reserves for all other credit unions. These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million. </p>  <p>  As such the Government and the Central Bank have fulfilled their role and it is now up to both the credit union and social housing sectors themselves to progress and develop any specific funding mechanisms. </p>  <p>  I understand three groups are currently seeking to establish an SPV to allow investment into Tier 3 AHBs, including the two credit union representative bodies the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Development Association.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the department with primary responsibility for the formulation and implementation of policy, and for the preparation of legislation, in relation to housing.</p></reply>

Details of the CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: .</p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing its business premises.</p><p>To make a claim under the CRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made. </p><p>For the purposes of the CRSS, a business premises is defined as the building or similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on.  It does not require that the premises is a rateable premises.  Mobile premises, or premises which are not permanently fixed in place, do not meet the definition of business premises.  </p><p>A business that does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, as in the case of an on-track bookmaker, a travel counsellor or certain businesses in the arts sector, will not meet the eligibility criteria.  </p><p>The CRSS is just one of the Government supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses not falling within the scope of the CRSS may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may qualify for other support schemes, where they meet certain criteria.  These include the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021, the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC).  However, a condition for eligibility for SBASC is that the business operates from a rateable premises.</p><p>There are no plans to revise the eligibility criteria for CRSS. The purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations.  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day operations of any bank operating within the State including banks in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.</p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions.</p>  <p>  This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system and in the main it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs, banks have decided that they cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason, banks have chosen to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.</p>  <p>  I am not in a position to comment on the potential impact on accounts used to hold funds for probate and conveyancing proceedings.  However, I understand that some legal practices have already taken steps to work closely with clients to ensure that clients' monies for transactions spends the least amount of time possible in the client account. </p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19.

The challenges have been unprecedented and Government has responded accordingly.  </p>  <p>  Last year, the Government made provision for approximately &euro;16.8 billion in direct expenditure interventions in response to the economic impacts of Covid-19 and to support key public services. This included additional funding of over &euro;2.5 billion to support our health service, as well as the introduction of supports for employees and businesses such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the Wage Subsidy Schemes, restart grants and commercial rates waivers.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Departmental Estimates for 2021 presented last December included expenditure on Covid-19 related measures and supports of &euro;6.5 billion.  These measures and supports include additional expenditure on employment and income supports arising from Covid-19, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment; ongoing costs in the Health service arising from the pandemic; additional funding in Education and Further and Higher Education and support for the operation of our public transport system given the capacity restrictions in place under public health guidelines.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further &euro;3.4 billion was set aside in the Recovery Fund and almost &euro;2 billion in a Contingency Reserve within the overall expenditure ceiling for 2021 of &euro;87.8bn. These reserve funds bring the funding provision for measures to respond to Covid-19 this year to almost &euro;12 billion. I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has made a distinction between core expenditure and the additional funds allocated to respond to Covid-19 so that when supports are no longer required, they do not permanently enter the expenditure base.</p>  <p>  The substantial additional funding provided across 2020 and 2021 is a result of the exceptional circumstances arising from this crisis. The Government&rsquo;s focus has been on implementing measures to support our people and businesses experiencing extreme difficulties, while ensuring that our health service has the resources to respond to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  While estimates of the structural balance were not published in Budget 2021, my Department is currently working on new estimates which will be published in April as part of a full set of updated medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts with the Stability Programme Update. </p></reply>

In early February, the Government agreed to an approach to developing an overarching Well-being Framework for Ireland utilising the OECD Well-being Framework as a starting point and building on national work already undertaken in this area. </p>  <p>  Work on the development of the Well-Being Framework is being led by the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform; and a Working Group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach involving a broad range of government departments, the Central Statistics Office and the National Economic and Social Council has been established to support this work. </p>  <p>  The development of the Framework is being further enhanced by consultation and broader engagement. The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) is leading this process and has established a subgroup of stakeholders and experts for this purpose.</p>  <p>  The development of the Framework will be an iterative process and evolve over time as its uses in the Irish context become clearer and more bespoke data becomes available, but it is intended to submit an initial report to Government on development of a draft Framework by the Summer.</p></reply>

These processing times are largely within our ambitious customer service targets of 2 and 4 weeks respectively.

From time-to-time IDA seeks to expand its global network of offices and teams.  Many firms are looking to expand into new markets and Ireland is a proven location for global companies to grow and serve their customer base in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.</p><p>IDA Ireland has decided to tender for a part-time Israel based Business Development Consultant.  This person will represent IDA to support its efforts to win new investment. This is a model used across many territories.  The Business Development Consultant will be expected to identify Israeli-headquartered target companies with potential for investing in Ireland, engage with senior decision-makers in these companies and present Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition as an investment location.</p><p>IDA Ireland has advised my Department that as part of its normal evaluation and due diligence process across all geographies, it considers many factors including societal and reputational risk, that could be associated with investment activities prior to accepting a client into its portfolio. </p><p>As an Agency of my Department, I expect IDA Ireland to align with Ireland's well known position on the illegality of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, which informs our engagement with the State of Israel across a range of bilateral issues, including trade.  Ireland distinguishes between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.  </p><p>The EU and its Member States, including Ireland, are wholly opposed to Israeli settlements, which are contrary to international law, and are damaging to the prospects of peace. </p><p>UN Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted on 23 December 2016, calls on all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.

It is a difficult time for Business owners, employees and their families.  With this in mind the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest that small business owners contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors.

Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work/life balance. Flexible working also assists in the development of an inclusive society.</p><p>My Department has not conducted research on the impact of moving to a four-day week, and it is not something I am currently considering. There is a large volume of work already underway on the topic of flexible working in my Department and across other Government departments. This was reflected in Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland, which included a number of key deliverables with the objective of fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. </p><p>On 15thJanuary 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s first National Remote Work Strategy to make remote working a permanent option for life after the pandemic was published. The Strategy is built on three fundamental pillars:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Create a Conducive Environment<br /><br />2.  Develop and Leverage Remote Work Infrastructure<br /><br />3.  Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework </blockquote>  <p>In the context of Pillar 1, I committed to legislate to provide employees with the right to request remote work. To inform this new legislation I am launching a 5 week public consultation very shortly and I encourage employers and employees alike to engage with this consultation and make their views known. </p><p>The forthcoming Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect will apply to all types of employment. I asked the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC to develop this Code as it will help employees, no matter what their job is, to strike a better work-life balance and switch off from work outside of their normal working hours. Because the Code is flexible, employees will have more options to work outside of traditional hours. It also reflects the fact that many employees are part of a global network, requiring contact with colleagues around the world.</p></reply>

The closing date for Local Authorities to receive applications for this scheme is 21st April 2021. </p>  <p>  If an employer must make an employee redundant, it is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to its eligible employees. However, in situations where an employer cannot sustain the cost of redundancy payments due to financial difficulties, the State may provide a safety net for both employers and employees by making the statutory redundancy payment to eligible employees on behalf of the employer. </p>  <p>  When such a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund, a debt is raised against the employer. The Department of Social Protection engages directly with the employer to ascertain their financial situation and their capacity to repay the debt. Where appropriate, an agreed repayment plan can be put in place to minimise financial hardship. For example, the debt can be recovered by way of instalments over a period of time.</p>  <p>  The redundancy rebate scheme was abolished in 2013 as it was not deemed a targeted use of resources. In contrast, the Redundancy Payments Scheme as it now operates benefits employees whose employers are unable to make statutory redundancy payments. The scheme considers both an employer&rsquo;s ability to pay and that the Social Insurance Fund can be reimbursed in the future, through debt repayment if an employer&rsquo;s financial position improves. This is a more targeted use of funds.</p></reply>

With this in mind the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website: Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie).</p>  <p>  At an early stage of this crisis, it became apparent that the impacts on economic activity were going to remain with us for much longer than originally anticipated. It also became clear that many businesses were incurring costs such as rent, rates, insurances, maintenance, security and other utilities, on an ongoing basis without the ability to generate the revenues required to meet these costs. Most of these costs are associated with the running costs of a premises, while for businesses without a fixed premises, fixed costs will likely be lower as a proportion of their total expenses. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that many businesses who do not trade from a commercial premises have been severely impacted and, for those individuals and businesses, Government has already moved to provide income supports in the form of the PUP and EWSS which are payable regardless of sector and are available to employees, sole traders and proprietary directors. </p>  <p>  Where gaps have been identified, Government has moved quickly to fill those gaps and to ensure that nobody is left behind. Self-employed individuals can now earn up to &euro;960 over an 8-week period and still remain eligible for the PUP. The Enterprise Support Grant, introduced by my colleague the Minister for Social Protection was a one-off grant introduced to reimburse certain non-rate paying businesses who had closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, for re-opening costs up to a maximum of &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  In the 2021 Budget, the Government allocated significant additional resources to Departments to provide help to different sectors. I would highlight the &euro;395m provided to the Department of Transport and the &euro;222m allocated to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. </p>  <p>  These additional monies will go towards helping businesses, including self-employed and those that are not rate paying businesses, such as through the &euro;30m for private bus operators and the &euro;55m for a focused business scheme for strategic tourism businesses.</p>  <p>  The Government is very much open to proposals as to how we can help further but the Government schemes are generally designed to help meet fixed costs that cannot be avoided and it is not possible to provide compensation for loss of personal income or profits. </p>  <p>  I and my colleagues across Government will continue to keep the range of measures under review with the goal of setting our country towards economic recovery. </p></reply>

I was pleased to have had the opportunity to take part in the launch of this initiative on 24 March along with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  While not directly engaged, the Government is supportive of this initiative, and determined to help unlock the opportunities this cooperation offers. We have set out in the National Planning Framework how we want to build on the strengths of the Dublin-Belfast Economic Corridor to capitalise on the clear economic potential of the region. That will involve effectively planning and developing new growth areas, investing in infrastructure and connectivity, and also protecting distinctive landscapes, green spaces and rural activities along the corridor.</p>  <p>  Further, through the New Decade, New Approach Agreement, the Irish Government has made a strong commitment to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to achieve greater connectivity on the island. This will help us to unlock the full potential of the all-island economy, the protection of which has been a central objective of Government over the last number of years, in particular as we have faced the challenges arising from Brexit. </p>  <p>  Over the last two decades, the developing all-island economy has benefited business in terms of improved scale and greater efficiencies.  This has happened because of the improvements brought about by peace, stability and an invisible border for goods, services, labour and finance. </p>  <p>  We are pleased that the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland means that trade in goods in either direction on the island of Ireland, and between Northern Ireland and the rest of the EU, can continue as before the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p>  <p>  The Protocol is designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to protect vital all-island supply chains, and to ensure the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. This will allow us to take advantage of the opportunities for cooperation between the key economic centres on this island.</p>  <p>  There are potential benefits too for Northern Ireland in its implementation, with access to Great Britain, but also to the EU market of 450 million people. This access is unique, vital for all-island supply chains, and offers opportunities for trade, jobs and investment. </p>  <p>  Belfast and Dublin have a great deal to offer each other, and this work to strengthen business links between the two cities is very welcome. There is potential for the Dublin-Belfast Economic Corridor to develop a unique international brand as a cross-border region with a particularly strong offering for Foreign Direct Investment, bearing in mind the continued access for businesses throughout the corridor to the EU&rsquo;s single market.</p>  <p>  The Government will work with the Northern Ireland Executive, through the North South Ministerial Council and other structures, to work towards a shared approach that will allow us to realise the development opportunities available. </p></reply>

Grant-aid under the scheme is available to eligible companies and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s global team are actively marketing the scheme across its life sciences clients and the related sub-supply base.</p>  <p>  The manufacture of medicinal products, including vaccines, is a complex activity that involves multiple production stages and manufacturing processes, specialist expertise, specific technology solutions and associated infrastructure and a well-coordinated global supply chain. The bulk of global manufacturing to date has been in dedicated vaccine production sites. Modification of an existing facility to manufacture a new product such as a vaccine, would require significant time and capital expenditure and a comprehensive regulatory assessment and is therefore not practical to meet the demands of speed and scale that are required to tackle the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is actively engaged across its portfolio of life science companies in response to COVID-19. In respect to the production of vaccines, this includes a focused and ongoing mapping of the sector. However, the response from the sector is that there is currently no available capacity within these pharmaceutical plants to produce COVID-19 vaccines. </p>  <p>  Last October I convened a series of short meetings with several of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s biopharmaceutical client companies to hear about the crucial role they are playing in the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and particularly on the work being done in Ireland to assist in the global efforts to combat COVID-19. I will continue to engage with pharmaceutical and life science companies so that I can reinforce our strong and ongoing commitment to this critical sector and to support innovative companies that are taking the lead in developing the new products and processes that will further develop the industry here in Ireland and to help us in the fight against COVID-19.</p></reply>

The LEOs also offer an extensive suite of training programmes, workshops and networking meetups, which have been moved to online platforms in response to the current health crisis. The LEOs act as a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for all relevant government supports available to the SME sector and can provide information/referrals to other bodies under agreed protocols such as Revenue, Micro Finance Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, LEADER, and Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  The LEOs offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (up to 10 employees) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector. Start-up businesses that have not begun trading may avail of LEO feasibility grant, priming grant and all ancillary support including training, management development and mentoring subject to meeting the eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  Feasibility grants link to the pre-start-up phase and their purpose is to help start-up companies or individual entrepreneurs with the cost of researching their proposed business or new business idea to determine whether it could be viable and sustainable.</p>  <p>  Priming grants for businesses trading less than 18 months aim to help them get the business with the associated costs of start-up. The maximum priming grant payable is 50% of the investment or &euro;150,000 &ndash; whichever is less. Only enterprises that clearly demonstrate a potential to graduate to Enterprise Ireland can be awarded grants of this size. In all other cases, the maximum grant is 50% of the investment or &euro;80,000 &ndash; whichever is the lesser. </p>  <p>  However, the Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services or construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p>  <p>  Businesses which have been trading for at least 6 months may also be applicable for the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVs), which offers a 50% co-funded voucher of up to &euro;2,500 (maximum value of &euro;5,000 when 50% co- funded by the applicant) to help businesses develop their online trading capability and includes training sessions that cover various topics, such as developing a website, digital marketing, social media for business and search engine optimisation. Funding can also be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to a business's website or developing new apps for customers. The voucher can also be used towards subscriptions to low cost online retail platform solutions to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices can also assist clients with applications to Microfinance Ireland for small business loans of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;25,000 (unsecured).

The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus and include the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates. </p>  <p>  These are in addition to financial assistance and other schemes provided to businesses via Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website: Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie)</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2021, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), operational through Revenue, offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID of up to &euro;5,000 per week.</p>  <p>  Changes have been made to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the EWSS. The new payment structure for the PUP includes the increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants. The EWSS is also being amended to align with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400. </p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest they contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.</p>  <p>  The level of support now being provided to businesses across all sectors is unprecedented and ahead of that available in other jurisdictions. Our focus is to ensure the safety of our people and guide our economy towards recovery by ensuring that we have an appropriate mix of supports in place to support workers and businesses in moving between the levels of the COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021- The Path Ahead.</p></reply>

At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance, or security costs, that still need to be paid. One person&rsquo;s rent might be another person&rsquo;s income or pension.</p><p>The issue of commercial rents is primarily a contractual matter for the parties involved. The Government has urged landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. </p><p>With this in mind, on 1st October 2020, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents, which was developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders and based on examples from other jurisdictions. The aim of the voluntary Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. It sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together.

With the increased scale and depth of this ambition, new strategies will be needed to sustain an emissions reductions trajectory, which increases over time. I am working with colleagues across Government to develop a 2021 Climate Action Plan, which will include additional initiatives in every sector, including biodiversity and nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises the need for coherence between our climate reform and biodiversity responsibilities. This is particularly the case in the agriculture sector, where the Programme for Government contains a dedicated section covering both climate action and biodiversity. It is important that reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy reward farmers for sequestering carbon, restoring biodiversity, improving water and air quality, producing clean energy, and developing schemes that support results-based outcomes. I am working with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine along with the Minister of State with responsibility for Land Use and Biodiversity, to maximise the clear synergies between climate and biodiversity policy. </p></reply>

The aim of such a system would be to help address the challenge of meeting increasing food demand internationally, while at the same time, contributing to climate commitments, including avoiding the off-shoring of agricultural activity to less carbon-efficient production systems. Such an initiative will require close collaboration and buy-in from other Member States and the European Commission. </p>  <p>  Ireland has significantly increased its climate ambition, with the implementation of the Climate Action Plan 2019 and the step change in climate objectives set out in the Programme for Government, including an average of 7% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions per annum form 2021 to 2030. This increase in ambition will be reflected in the next iteration of the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency's recent  publication &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Environment: An Integrated Assessment 2020&rdquo;, demonstrates that the overall quality of Ireland&rsquo;s environment is on a downward trend, requiring us to accelerate addressing these challenges across all sectors of the economy and wider society. In drafting the Climate Action Plan 2021, far reaching policy changes will be developed across every sector, including agriculture, that set us on the path of systemic change that is required for Ireland to become a climate-neutral and climate-resilient society and economy by 2050 at the latest.  </p>  <p>  With the 2030 Climate Target Plan and EU Climate Law, the EU will raise its ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. This is a substantial increase compared to the existing 40% emissions reduction target. The Commission is preparing to present, by June 2021, an overhaul of all relevant climate legislation as part of a &ldquo;Fit for 55 Package&rdquo; to align with the newly proposed target. As part of preparing this legislation, the Commission will consider how emissions are accounted for between the agriculture and land-use sectors. </p></reply>

The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  Retrofitting has the ability to contribute to a number of important goals including - decarbonisation; warmer, more comfortable homes; and job creation and retention.  </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to finalise an estimate of the cost of the retrofit programme in the context of the National Development Plan Review and finalising a National Retrofit Framework.  The overall estimated cost will include assumptions around the dwelling types (detached, semi-detached, terraced, apartment) and the starting Building Energy Rating of the properties to be retrofitted as well as a range of other factors.   </p>  <p>  The Department funds a number of grant schemes to support homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. Partial grants are available for homeowners who can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy efficiency retrofits for people at risk of energy poverty. These are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since 2000, around 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. </p>  <p>  &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for residential and community retrofit programmes to be funded by my Department through the SEAI.

This momentum needs to be maintained and if An Post, the postmasters and Government work together we can ensure that the network can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services.</p><p>An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p><p>The Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. In that regard, Government recently approved the Report on the Provision of Offline Government Services and the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Group, co-chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to, <i>inter alia,</i>examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to the post office network. The Group will report back to Government by the end of July.</p><p>Government is committed to working with An Post and postmasters to ensure that the network continues to play a strong role in delivering State services. As with any business the post office needs to develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for its users. All options will be considered fully and every effort made to give effect to the Government commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network.</p></reply>

While my Department has not commissioned any reports of the nature described in the question, the Government, through the National Broadband Plan in particular, is investing very significantly in addressing the digital divide and in ensuring that schools and individual students have the necessary connectivity to fully participate in the digital society. The NBP will ensure that over 1.1 million of our citizens that currently live in areas without access to a reliable high speed broadband service will have access to this service going forward, at a cost comparable to urban areas.  </p><p>With respect to schools, my Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at <i></i>.</p><p>Telecommunication service providers have reacted to the Covid crisis by taking a number of measures to help people stay connected during the pandemic. Some of these measures are of particular relevance to students, such as measures taken to increase data limits on many existing packages and introduce new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, including unlimited data packages at a low cost.</p></reply>

A total of &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes this year. This represents an additional &euro;100 million, or an 82% increase, on the 2020 allocation and is the largest ever budget for the schemes. This allocation is kick-starting the first phase of our retrofit plan.</p>  <p>  Of this amount, &euro;109 million is allocated to provide free upgrades for lower income households. This is a &euro;47 million increase on the 2020 allocation. &euro;112.5 million will be spent on expanding other existing SEAI grant schemes and introducing new initiatives. The first of the new schemes was launched in September when a call for projects under the new National Retrofit (One-Stop-Shop Development) scheme issued. A &euro;30 million call for projects under the Communities Energy Grant scheme was launched in November. A targeted heat-pump ready homes campaign was also launched. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer. The grant schemes provided by SEAI are however reviewed on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  The Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income homeowners who are vulnerable to energy poverty.  Revisits under this scheme are currently not available. There are over 8,000 homes on the current work programme that have not previously received free upgrades under the scheme, and these homes are the priority to receive upgrades. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Homes scheme aims to improve energy efficiency by providing grant support for energy efficiency upgrades to homeowners whose homes were built and occupied prior to 2006 for insulation and heating control systems and 2011 for heat pump and solar thermal grants. Under the scheme a home cannot receive grant funding twice for the same energy efficiency measure. </p>  <p>  Under the Community Energy Grant Scheme and the National Home Retrofit (One Stop Shop Development) Scheme, grants may be claimed for additional measures to increase the energy efficiency of a home as part of an overall project to achieve a specified target. For example, external wall insulation can be supported in homes that previously received cavity wall insulation where it is determined that it is an appropriate intervention as part of an overall upgrade project to attain B2 or cost optimal and meet the minimum BER uplift.  </p></reply>

Under this legislation, the first two carbon budgets proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council shall provide for a reduction of 51% in the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions over the course of the first two budgetary periods ending on 31 December 2030, from the annual greenhouse gas emissions reported for the year ending on 31 December 2018, as set out in the national greenhouse gas emissions inventory prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency. The legislation, which is a key commitment in the Programme for Government, will now progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas as priority legislation.  </p>  <p>  In parallel, Ireland has welcomed and is supportive of the development of a European Climate Law, which will set a legally binding target for Europe&rsquo;s economy and society to become climate-neutral by 2050. Ireland also fully supports the enhanced ambition at EU level to increase the EU 2030 target to at least 55% emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels. The European Environmental Agency report that the EU27 have reduced their emissions by approximately 23% from 1990 levels, meaning a further reduction in the order of 30% will be required from 2018 emissions levels to meet the new EU target.  </p>  <p>  However, it is difficult to provide direct comparisons with the European Climate Law to the Programme for Government commitment given that:  </p>  <p>  the balance of effort (in achieving the enhanced EU ambition) between the EU-wide ETS and individual Member State targets has not yet been decided;</p>  <p>  many revisions have been proposed to the current architecture; and</p>  <p>  in determining legally binding targets for Member States under the Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU balances technical, economic, equity and political considerations.</p></reply>

The visible Environmental Management Cost (vEMC) would not therefore have been applied to them. Recognising this issue, and in advance of the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided &euro;700,000 to help remove historic waste tyres from farms. The funding was allocated across numerous geographical locations and the budget was fully expended. In the case of such historic tyres, the primary responsibility for the management of this waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste, i.e. the natural or legal person in possession of the waste, or the producer of the waste. The Waste Management Act 1996 imposes a general duty of care on holders of waste. A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes, or is likely to cause environmental pollution.   Since the introduction of the EPR scheme for tyres, operated by Repak Elt, any tyres which have incurred the vEMC are collected free of charge by Repak Elt through registered waste collectors.  I understand Repak Elt has no records of tyres on which the charge has been paid subsequently being delivered to any farmers. </p></reply>

Further provisional offers of funding to 'strand 2' projects, totalling &euro;27.8 million, were made to 47 projects in November 2020.The percentage allocations to the three priority areas for strand 1 were: </p><p>- Priority 1: 63% </p><p>- Priority 2: 10%</p><p>- Priority 3: 27%</p><p>The funding allocations to the three priority areas under strand 2, based on the provisional offers, are:</p><p>- Priority 1: 76%</p><p>- Priority 2: 13%</p><p>- Priority 3 11%</p><p>My Department to date has issued &euro;169,747 to Strand 1 projects. There have been no pre-funding or drawdown requests made for strand 2 projects as funding agreements have not yet been finalised for these projects. </p><p>The Just Transition Fund call has sought to ensure a geographical spread of successful projects across the eight eligible counties of the Wider Midlands region and, if a sufficient spread of applications was submitted from each of the eligible counties, seek to ensure that a minimum of 5% of the total allocated spend goes to each of the eight counties. My Department intends to publish the final funding allocations on a county-by-county basis once all funding agreements are in place. </p></reply>

Provisional offers were made to projects which successfully met the evaluation criteria and terms and conditions set out in the published call documentation.  Further details can be found in &lsquo;Section 6 &ndash;JTF Evaluation Criteria&rsquo; of the Department's call Information Booklet. </p><p>Key objectives of this evaluation process, based on the published evaluation criteria, included avoiding duplication of existing funding streams, with applications required to indicate if the proposed project had already secured Exchequer or EU funding; and the prioritisation of projects which could demonstrate potential added value at a regional level.  </p><p>Of the projects that have already concluded funding agreements with my Department, three projects are based on the potential utilisation of Bord na M&oacute;na land on which agreement has been reached with Bord na M&oacute;na in each instance. Two of these projects are feasibility studies and no works on Bord na M&oacute;na property are envisaged as part of these projects. The third project, <i>Extension to Peatland Biodiversity Boardwalk 4th Final Phase</i>, at Lullymore, County Kildare, envisages the construction of a boardwalk over Bord na Mona peatlands that have been leased to the applicant on a long-term basis. </p><p>Evidence of ownership or permission to use land, property or facilities, and relevant statutory permissions, where applicable, must be provided by projects to my Department in advance of a funding agreement being finalised. In certain cases, relevant permissions may not be required until later in a project and evidence of these having being secured will form part of the relevant project milestones, or a contractual condition, as appropriate. In each case, it is a matter for the project sponsor to secure relevant permissions for the proposed use of land, property or other facilities. </p></reply>

Under the legislation, Governments are required to adopt a series of economy-wide five-year carbon budgets, including relevant sectoral targets, on a rolling 15-year basis, starting in 2021. Actions for each sector will be detailed in the Climate Action Plan, updated annually and a National Long Term Climate Action Strategy will be prepared every five years.</p>  <p>  EirGrid's public consultation on &ldquo;Shaping our Electricity Future&rdquo; aims to make the electricity grid stronger and more flexible so that it can a carry lot more renewable generation. EirGrid&rsquo;s consultation will align with Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to further reduce electricity emissions which will be set out in this year&rsquo;s revision to the Climate Action Plan. EirGrid estimate that in order to continue to meet the high standards of security of supply, while installing a high level of variable wind and solar renewable generation, approximately 1,500 &ndash; 2,000 MW of high efficiency and high availability generation is needed. This is required to replace the generation capacity exiting (such as peat and coal) and to meet growing demand. EirGrid expect that gas will play a key role in meeting this requirement.</p>  <p>  The major ramp up in the levels of renewables on our power grid and the move to a highly electrified economy means we also need to ensure security of supply to provide a reliable electricity service to households and businesses. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities and EirGrid  both have responsibilities to ensure security of electricity supply. A key mechanism to achieve this is the Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM) under the overall regulatory supervision of the SEM Committee. The most recent CRM auction, for the 2024/25 capacity year, was in January 2021 and the results were approved by the SEM Committee at the end of February. Following the initial assessment of this auction, the SEM Committee published a consultation about holding a T-3 auction for the 2024/25 capacity year, which is expected to be held in January 2022.  </p>  <p>  My Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems. The review will include a detailed technical analysis and a public consultation. It is planned that the review will be completed by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis and the wait times have been impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. The work programme was particularly impacted by COVID-19 between March and June of last year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines. The scheme has again been paused since additional restrictions on the construction sector were reintroduced in January. It is intended to recommence works as soon as the public health guidance allows. </p>  <p>  Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021 &ndash; an increase of &euro;47 million on last year. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. These initiatives will increase the number of homes that can be retrofitted when COVID restrictions are lifted.</p></reply>

In addition to supporting, where feasible, switching trips to sustainable mobility options, a transition to low and zero emission cars is one of the changes necessary if Ireland is to substantially reduce its transport emissions.</p>  <p>  Government has put in place several key policies and provided generous incentives to encourage the transition from conventional, fossil fuel vehicles towards lower-emitting fuels and technologies including electric vehicles (EVs).  EVs are a prominent mitigation measure in the Climate Action Plan and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is very challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceilings in future years.</p>  <p>  The transition of the taxi and hackney fleet (technically called Small Public Service Vehicles - SPSVs) towards zero/low-emission vehicles has an important role to play in effecting a substantial reduction in transport CO2 and of air pollutant emissions, particularly in Irish towns and cities due to the high mileage travelled by these vehicles, the stop/start and idling nature of their work, as well as the predominance of fossil fuels within the sector. Increasing the uptake of electric vehicles in the SPSV sector also has a strong leadership and demonstration effect on the public, introducing more people to low/zero emission mobility options. As such, I was delighted to announce the continuation and extension of the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme in 2021.   The Scheme which is administered by the NTA provides enhanced supports, up to &euro;20,000, for eligible taxi and hackney drivers switching to EVs. </p>  <p>  In addition, at Budget time, I announced a 2021 allocation of &euro;15 million which will support up to 750 taxi and hackney drivers in scrapping their older vehicles and replacing them with zero-emission capable electric alternatives. The scrappage scheme is open for taxis and hackneys reaching their maximum permissible age limit in 2020/21. Up to &euro;20,000 is available for eligible drivers switching to a new all-electric vehicle and up to &euro;32,500 for those moving to a wheelchair accessible full electric vehicle.</p>  <p>  As a further measure to support the SPSV sector's transition to low emissions, dedicated charging infrastructure for EV taxis is currently being developed across the country. Last year, my Department funded installation of SPSV-dedicated EV charging infrastructure at Dublin and Cork airports, as well as at Heuston, Kent and Colbert train stations.  My Department will support further installations for SPSV charging at key transport hubs in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Other supports to incentivise the take-up of EVs more generally include: </p>  <p>- Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) relief of up to &euro;5,000 for battery electric vehicles and low rates of VRT for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;</p>  <p>- Up to &euro;5,000 in grant support for the private purchase of a new electric car (M1), and up to &euro;3,800 for the purchase of a new electric van (N1) by a company or where a motor dealership is purchasing a demonstration vehicle;</p>  <p>- Benefit-in-kind tax relief for battery electric vehicles;</p>  <p>- Grant support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600;</p>  <p>- Lowest rate of motor tax (&euro;120 per annum) for battery electric vehicles and generally low rates of motor tax for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; and</p>  <p>- A discount on tolls of 50% for battery electric vehicles and 25% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (up to a maximum amount of &euro;500 per year with greater reductions off-peak on the M50).</p></reply>

These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, with some of these now extended to 30 June 2021. Irish airlines and airports have availed of over &euro;200 million through these supports to date. Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises. </p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically  for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, over &euro;21 million, is being provided to our Regional Airports Programme (RAP). The new RAP, published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. Those airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock). Additionally, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. </p>  <p>  The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. This scheme consists of three measures: a damage compensation measure; an aid measure to support the airport operators up to a maximum of &euro;1.8 million per beneficiary; and an aid measure to support the uncovered fixed costs of these companies. The aid will take the form of direct grants and airports will be invited to apply for funding under this Scheme shortly.</p>  <p>  This scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and to make a recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. It cannot be excluded that further targeted supports may be required later in 2021, particularly in the event that restrictions on travel remain in place throughout the forthcoming summer season.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy. It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel, but we remain committed to ensuring that the aviation sector can maintain the necessary core capability to retain strategic connectivity, and to quickly rebound when circumstances allow.</p></reply>

Funding under CEF is delivered in the form of co-funding grants allocated following competitive calls for proposals. Co-funding rates vary depending on the call for proposals and the type of project, generally ranging from 20% to 50% of eligible costs. Under the 2014 - 2020 programme, a total of &euro;30.2 million had been awarded to road projects led by or involving Irish project promoters. The drawdown of EU funding provided under the CEF programme is not readily available by year.</p><p>This funding supported a variety of road infrastructure projects.  These include the development and deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) for traffic management led by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the rollout of a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) network by Gas Networks Ireland, and studies undertaken by Donegal County Council. The last mentioned project concerns the preparatory work required to remove bottlenecks over a length of 31 km at three road sections in Co Donegal: Ballybofey to Stranorlar; Letterkenny to Manorcunningham; and Manorcunningham to Lifford/Strabane. This covers the designs and reports required to obtain the necessary statutory and other approvals to facilitate the future construction.  This project aims to enhance regional accessibility and improve connectivity and traffic flows to/from the North-West region.</p><p>Details on each of the road projects funded by CEF 2014 - 2020, are available at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The new CEF programme for 2021 - 2027 will see approximately &euro;11.3 billion available under the general envelope for all transport projects, open to all Member States. Negotiations on a three-year work programme for the 2021 &ndash; 2023 period are near completion. The work programme will set out the indicative budgets and types of eligible projects that can apply for co-funding grants. The aim of this is to enhance predictability and transparency for stakeholders, enabling higher quality proposals to be submitted to the EU.</p><p>In terms of road infrastructure, funding opportunities are set to continue in the fields of ITS and alternative fuel infrastructure, with a greater focus on electricity and hydrogen. It will also allow Member States with no rail network or Member States with an isolated rail network, including Ireland, to apply for the funding of road construction.</p><p>My Department and I continue to promote the CEF programme to Irish stakeholders with the aim of maximising Ireland's potential drawdown of EU funds for transport. All potential applications to the programme in the coming years, including for roads, will be considered and evaluated in the context of national priorities and Ireland's overall participation in the programme.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, historically, the Cohesion Fund was a significant envelope for supporting our national transport networks, including our roads. While the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility for EU Cohesion Policy and the European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds, it should be noted that the Cohesion Fund is directed towards Member States whose Gross National Income (GNI) per inhabitant is less than 90% of the EU average. For the 2014-2020 period, the countries that qualified for the Cohesion Fund were: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. As net EU budget contributor, Ireland does not qualify for Cohesion funding.</p></reply>

This is similar to other ports in Ireland which receive no Exchequer funding and must fund all their infrastructure developments through their own resources, borrowing or through EU grant funding.  </p>  <p>  There has been a significant increase in shipping services from Rosslare direct to the continent as a result of Brexit. Rosslare reports huge demand for these services with an almost 500% increase in freight units through Rosslare when compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort&rsquo;s strategic development plans for the port over the coming years includes investment plans for &euro;35 million in customer facilities, port infrastructure, freight facilities, port assets, new technology and linking the new entrance of the port with the proposed new port access road.  </p>  <p>  The Masterplan will allow for expansion in the port&rsquo;s current key areas of RoRo freight and passenger transport. </p>  <p>  The Department of Transport (DoT) has been advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that this investment is to be financed from the port&rsquo;s own resources and planning approval has been granted by Wexford County Council for the development. </p>  <p>  The Department has further been advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that clearance work commenced in December 2020. The company envisages the completion of this work over the course of four phases totalling between three and five years and that the port will be able to continue to operate normally while this is carried out. </p>  <p>  In addition, with regard to the upgrade of the N11/N25 from Oilgate to Rosslare Harbour, Wexford County Council is in the process of studying feasible options for the development of this project, taking into account feedback received from local residents and community groups during the public consultation. It is currently anticipated that the preferred scheme option will be confirmed and announced by week ending 18th of July.</p>  <p>  Wexford County Council are also progressing the N25 Rosslare Europort Access Road and the preferred scheme option was confirmed in December 2020. The Preferred Scheme Option is now progressing through Design and Environmental Evalu­ation, and it is anticipated that the scheme will proceed to Statutory Processes in late 2021.</p>  <p>  The N25 Rosslare Europort Access Road will tie-into the N25 Ballygillane Roundabout which is anticipated to proceed to construction in late 2021. </p></reply>

In my mind that rejuvenation means increasing the &lsquo;liveability&rsquo; and quality of life for all citizens who live or visit our cities, towns and villages and making them centres of commercial, social and cultural activity for their hinterlands, whether that hinterland is urban or rural in nature.</p><p>I acknowledge that this issue is a whole of Government one and indeed one for which the Deputy&rsquo;s own Department has an important role. I understand that his Department is developing new &lsquo;sustainable settlement guidance&rsquo; to offer practical and targeted guidance towards improving practice as regards sustainable settlement planning and best practice urban design, including reducing the impact of parking on the public realm. This will type of guidance will support work underway in relation to the &lsquo;Town Centres First' initiative which is being led by his Department and the Department for Rural and Community Development, an initiative which I very much support. </p><p>A key part of that rejuvenation of our urban centres means improving the public realm and that is recognized in the <i>National Planning Framework</i>through its references to same for each of the five cities and also its specific National Policy Objective 18a in respect of rural towns. I note this particular National Policy Objective is also supported within the recommendations of <i>Our Rural Future &ndash; Rural Development Policy 2021 to 2025</i>which was launched this week. </p><p>Interventions in our urban centres must therefore be considered with regard to whether that intervention will improve the &lsquo;liveability&rsquo; of the area or detract from it. I believe that a key intervention in that regard within the ambit of my Department is to increase the funding available to support improved active travel infrastructure &ndash; walking and cycling &ndash; and I am delighted that we have increased that funding and are now seeing active travel specific funding being rolled out across the country. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to know that issue of parking in urban centres and its influence on people&rsquo;s choice of transport mode is something that was raised by consultees during my Department&rsquo;s consultation period on our review of sustainable mobility policy and it was also considered as part of the <i>Five Cities Demand Management Study,</i>which will be published very shortly. </p><p>It is my clear position that we need to promote sustainable mobility and prioritise interventions that assist, and not hinder, that promotion. </p></reply>

To assist with the programme of continual improvement there have been several improvements made to training, equipment and procedures which in the recent past has necessitated the temporary suspension of operations, i.e., boat and cliff functions, to facilitate the necessary improvements to the safety of the volunteers.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Coast Guard continues to work on the various recommendations of the MCIB report into the tragic loss of Caitriona Lucas which has in this case resulted in necessary improvements to the training for the crews of the boat units.</p>  <p>  The recent temporary suspension of cliff operations was based on a risk assessment and was necessary to address safety matters within this function. The Irish Coast Guard is working to address these matters, as a priority, to re-instate the services at the earliest opportunity. The Irish Coast Guard has been in regular contact with the Cliff Unit Officers in Charge and have outlined the plan to address these matters. This plan has been shared with all Cliff units who are continually updated on the progress of the various matters being addressed. </p>  <p>  The necessary improvements within the Irish Coast Guard, in this instance in the cliff rescue function, have been introduced to deliver effective oversight and management of the volunteer Coast Guard Units and to ensure that the Department meets its obligations in terms of securing and managing the health and safety of the volunteers while conducting Coast Guard activities. The Irish Coast Guard continues to take a pro-active approach to the safety of volunteers and will continue to mitigate risks to the volunteer Coast Guard units as they serve their local communities.</p>  <p>  The contribution of over 900 volunteers to delivering on the mission statement of the Irish Coast Guard is most noteworthy. The Irish Coast Guard is committed to supporting the Coast Guard units who are manned with dedicated volunteers who give, with the support of their families, so freely of their time and energy. Equally the Irish Coast Guard will continue to discharge its duty of care to the volunteers by ensuring that the service is fit for purpose and is subjected to necessary improvements as and when they are required.</p></reply>

Air passenger rights are protected by Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, which covers the rights of airline passengers in instances of flight cancellations.  It provides that where a flight is cancelled then the consumer must receive a refund within seven days.  The EU Package Travel Directive provides a separate suite of consumer protections for people who make bookings through a licensed travel agent or tour operator.  The customers of licensed travel agents and tour operators are entitled to refund within two weeks should they or their holiday provider cancel the booking.</p>  <p>  While the legal position is one aspect, I have also sought clarification from both Aer Lingus and Ryanair on their current rebooking policies, particularly in the light of customers choosing not to travel. Aer Lingus has indicated that under their &ldquo;Book with Confidence&rdquo; policy - covering all flights scheduled to run until the end of 2021 including those who may have already re-booked for a future travel date &ndash; customers are able to change their travel date free of charge, as many times as they wish up to 2 hours before their flight. They also indicate that passengers may swap their booking for a voucher and that their vouchers are valid for 5 years.</p>  <p>  Ryanair has stated that the expiry dates for vouchers that were issued last year have been extended to enable passengers to make bookings when travel is open again. In this vein, rebooking can also be made with no charge of flight fee for travel before 31 Oct 2021. Vouchers that were offered to customers whose flights were cancelled can be converted to cash at any time or can be redeemed for future bookings.</p>  <p>  If any individuals are unclear about their rights, the Commission for Aviation Regulation has a dedicated web site for consumers www.flightrights.ie.</p></reply>

It is important to remember that driver licensing law exists to ensure that people licensed to drive on our roads meet high standards of safety.  The standards for testing drivers are set at EU level. As such, all EU driving licences are exchangeable when a person moves from one Member State to another.</p>  <p>  In the case of non-EU jurisdictions, we may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange. These agreements can be made only when the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes, so that each side can be satisfied that they are compatible. On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).</p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchangeable licence, we have no option but to require them to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence. This is a matter of public safety. While many may have a safe driving record, we have no way of measuring this.  </p>  <p>  People with a full but non-exchangeable licence go through the normal driver learning process but can avail of the shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12, and they do not have to be a learner for the usual minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test.</p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that a learner permit is not a licence, but a permit to allow a person to drive while learning.   There will be no exceptions to the current laws in force around learner drivers. An unaccompanied learner driver who is stopped by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may face penalty points, a fixed charge, seizure of the vehicle and possible prosecution.</p></reply>

Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and public transport was designated amongst the essential services that have continued to operate during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank all operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the safe operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.   </p>  <p>  The Government's "Living with Covid Plan" and subsequent "Recovery and Resilience Plan" sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the Plan and provides guidance for the public about using public transport at the different risk levels, including that wearing face coverings is mandatory and encouraging the use of off-peak services and sustainable active travel alternative options, where feasible.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware, the country moved from Level 3 to Level 5 of the Plan with a number of specific adjustments at midnight on 24 December 2020 meaning public transport went from using 50% to 25% of vehicle capacity with effect from 26 December.  Further announcements were made by An Taoiseach on 30 December and 6 January 2021 introducing  additional health restrictions with public transport continuing to operate at 25% of vehicle capacity.  Since then, the NTA has advised customers to continue to only use public transport for necessary journeys and to avoid peak-time travel.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, in particular frontline workers and students.</p>  <p>  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's query in relation to the 84X route, this is an operational matter for the NTA in conjunction with Dublin Bus. Therefore I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct response. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days. </p></reply>

The Driver Theory Test has not been deemed to be an essential service under Level 5 restrictions. The service will remain closed while level 5 restrictions remain in place. While I fully appreciate the inconvenience this poses, I must emphasise, that this decision has been taken in line with official public health recommendations that everyone in Ireland work to limit the spread of the virus by staying at home in so far as is possible and minimising social contacts. </p>  <p>  Theory tests were first suspended due to Covid-19, in March 2020. The service resumed, on a gradual basis, in mid-June.  When operations resumed, there was inevitably an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog. Unfortunately, due to social distancing and other public health and hygiene requirements, service capacity was considerably reduced and customers experienced longer waiting times.  </p>  <p>  Level 5 restrictions took effect again for six weeks from 22 October 2020 to the 01 December andwere re-instated again from the end of December. The service will remain closed while we remain in level 5.</p>  <p>  The RSA is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services resume. In this regard, the aim is to double capacity at test centres over a three-month period. Subject to decisions on future Covid 19 restrictions, this will mean that additional capacity would be made available in April, May and June 2021.</p>  <p>  Normal capacity before the pandemic was approximately 15,000 tests per month.  When the service reopened in June 2020, this was increased to 25,000 to deal with the backlog which had developed by that point.  Based on the capacity of 25,000 tests per month, the aim is to provide an additional 25,000 tests per month on top of this for the first 3 months of reopening, or a total of 75,000 extra test appointments over the three-month period. This would make substantial inroads into numbers waiting over that time period.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased capacity initiative, the RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. The online service has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses and is now being evaluated with a view to extending the online service to all test types during 2021 However, scaling up operations to facilitate higher numbers will take time to achieve.</p>  <p>   As you can appreciate, the first priority has to be public safety &ndash; we want to provide services, and we know that people are looking for services, but services can only be provided to the limit possible while preserving public health.</p></reply>

Small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators have been badly affected due to their dependence on the hospitality and tourism sectors. Limousine operators, who are particularly dependent on overseas tourism and major events, have suffered a near total drop in demand for their services and many have been simply unable to work since the pandemic started in March of last year.</p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports for businesses like these that are adversely affected by Covid.  These supports include wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports. Many SPSV operators, including limousine drivers, have been able to avail of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which remains open to new applicants. This payment continues to provide an important safety net to operators, recognising their dependency on other sectors of the economy, notably the hospitality industry.</p>  <p>  As mentioned, limousine drivers are particularly dependent on tourism and the 2021 Budget put in place a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen that sector. The total funding for the tourism sector has increased in 2021 by over &euro;59 million or 36% over the initial 2020 allocation in Budget 2020 to &euro;220.9 million. Further details on these measures are available from my colleague, the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Catherine Martin T.D.</p>  <p>  Measures to support the SPSV industry have also been taken by the industry&rsquo;s statutory regulator, the National Transport Authority (NTA). These measures include the waiver of vehicle licencing fees for 2021, the waiver of late renewal fees, and the facilitation of insurance suspensions for vehicles in conjunction with the insurance industry.</p></reply>

This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work is being carried out in such a way so that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic law or road safety in general. Department officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation which I intend to bring forward as committee stage amendmentsin in the Road Traffic Bill.</p>  <p>  The current approach taken by my Department to permit the safe use of e-scooters on public roads takes into consideration the rapid development of these vehicles used for personal transportation. In order to future-proof the legislation and account for the development of these new vehicles, the road traffic acts are being amended to introduce a new category of vehicle - the proposed title for this new category is "powered personal transporters". This will be the first time the categories of vehicles set out in the Road Traffic Act 1961 have been amended.</p>  <p>  Once the new category has been defined, these vehicles are to be incorporated into the existing legislative framework (wherein a range of powers/offences already exist) and this will permit the Minister for Transport to regulate for the use/misuse and the standards for different types of powered personal transporters through the introduction of regulations for e-scooters. Furthermore, the existing offences and powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in road traffic legislation concerning careless/dangerous driving, driving under the influence of an intoxicant, driving an unroadworthy vehicle. etc., can also then be extended to users of powered personal transporters where required.</p>  <p>  This new category of vehicles for private use will not be subject to registration or insurance regulations. However, owners may take out private insurance and will be strongly encouraged to do so. </p></reply>

This is an essential safety check and an important road safety measure that provides for a reduction in road accidents by detecting defects such as faulty brakes, worn tyres or defective headlights.</p>  <p>  The applicable dates for periodic testing is provided for by national legislation. Under Regulation 3(2) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415/2017), the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date.  Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle and any NCT certificate issued in respect of a vehicle is only valid up to the test due date that falls after that certificate was issued. </p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment on individual circumstances, I would remind the Deputy that vehicles under the scope of S.I. No. 415 of 2017 are required to have a valid NCT Certificate in force against that vehicle on the fourth anniversay of the first registration of that vehicle and "until the tenth anniversary of first registration of the vehicle, each subsequent biennial of that date". It is therefore only required to be tested on the subsequent biennial anniversary of the test due date, until such a time as it reaches its 10th anniversary of registration - when it will be required to be tested on each subsequent anniversary.</p>  <p>  I would also remind the Deputy that is the responsibility of road users to ensure that their vehicle is in compliance with the law and in possession of a valid roadworthiness certificate if it is intended that the vehicle will be used on a public road or in a public place, regardless of the level of use anticipated. Enforcement of Road Traffic Regulations, including the validity of a roadworthiness certificate, is the responsibility of An Garda Siochana.</p></reply>

Following discussions with trade union and employer representatives, the Government has agreed to strengthen the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) which has played an important role throughout the COVID-19 crisis. The LEEF deals with economic and employment issues relevant to the labour market and a sub-group for aviation has been established under my chair. </p>  <p>  On 5 March 2021, Minister Ryan chaired a special meeting of the Steering Committee of the the National Civil Aviation Development Forum . The NCADF, which was established through a recommendation of the National Aviation Policy in 2016, brings together senior stakeholders in the aviation industry, mostly at chief executive level. The meeting provided an opportunity for very constructive engagement with members of the Committee, together with some other senior leaders from Irish aviation. It is clear from from my engagement with the aviation sector that the priority issue for all those involved in the industry is for planning to progress, as a matter of urgency, the reopening of international travel as soon as circumstances allow.</p>  <p>  To this end, a sub-group of the NCADF has been tasked with developing proposals for restart and recovery of the Irish aviation sector. It is anticipated that the sub-group will present its report to the Steering group of the NCADF in the coming weeks. The work of the NCADF will inform Government decisions on the restart and recovery of the Irish aviation sector, which will also have regard to developments at EU and international level, and public health advice.</p></reply>

This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work is being carried out in such a way so that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic law or road safety in general. Department officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation which I intend to bring forward as committee stage amendments in in the Road Traffic Bill.</p>  <p>  The current approach taken by my Department to permit the safe use of e-scooters on public roads takes into consideration the rapid development of these vehicles used for personal transportation. In order to future-proof the legislation and account for the development of these new vehicles, the road traffic acts are being amended to introduce a new category of vehicle - the proposed title for this new category is "powered personal transporters". This will be the first time the categories of vehicles set out in the Road Traffic Act 1961 have been amended.</p>  <p>  Once the new category has been defined, these vehicles are to be incorporated into the existing legislative framework (wherein a range of powers/offences already exist) and this will permit the Minister for Transport to regulate for the use/misuse and the standards for different types of powered personal transporters through the introduction of regulations. Furthermore, the existing offences and powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in road traffic legislation concerning careless/dangerous driving, driving under the influence of an intoxicant, driving an unroadworthy vehicle. etc. can also then be extended to users of powered personal transporters where required.</p></reply>

This is an essential safety check and an important road safety measure that provides for a reduction in road accidents by detecting defects such as faulty brakes, worn tyres or defective headlights.</p>  <p>  The applicable dates for periodic testing and voluntary testing is provided for by national legislation. Under Regulation 3(2) and 3(3) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415/2017), the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date.  Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle. It is important to note that the NCT certificate relates only to the condition of testable items at the time of the test and does not constitute a warranty for their condition for the subsequent 12-month period.  Any NCT certificate issued in respect of a vehicle is only valid up to the test due date that falls after that certificate was issued. </p>  <p>  Where a vehicle is presented for a voluntary test not more than 90 days prior to its test due date, it will be issued with a test report valid until the dates outlined in Regulation 3(2). In the case of a vehicle being presented for a voluntary test greater than 90 days prior to its subsequent test due date, the next test due date shall be:</p>  <p>  (i) until the tenth anniversary of first registration of the vehicle, each subsequent biennial of the date such test report was issued;</p>  <p>  (ii) from the tenth anniversary of first registration of the vehicle, each subsequent anniversary of the date such test report was issued; and,</p>  <p>  (iii) from the thirtieth anniversary of first registration of the vehicle, each subsequent biennial of the date such test report was issued.</p>  <p>  There are no current plans to amend this legislation in respect of test due dates. </p></reply>

Traffic in 2020 was down around 80% on 2019, and revenue has fallen away dramatically as COVID-19 related restrictions on international travel continue to heavily constrain passenger traffic. </p>  <p>  My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis, and Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses including the aviation sector. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, with some of these now extended to 30 June 2021. Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises.</p>  <p>  Support for aviation workers is currently tied to the Governments general schemes to support all workers impacted by COVID-19. However, it cannot be excluded that targeted supports may be required later in 2021, particularly in the event that restrictions on travel remain in place throughout the forthcoming summer season.</p>  <p>  As regards supports specifically targeted at the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, over &euro;21 million, is being provided to our Regional Airports Programme (RAP). The new RAP, published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. Those airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock). Additionally, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. Both of these programmes have been created in line with EU State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators, including Cork Airport, for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. This scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and to make a recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. </p></reply>

The analysis found that the sectors most exposed to both the Covid-19 and &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit shocks appear to be distinct and relatively unconnected. While the analysis was based on the assumption of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit, this general conclusion is still applicable today. </p>  <p>  Although the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK provides for zero-tariffs and zero-quotas for qualifying goods, it will nevertheless introduce trade frictions in the form of non-tariff barriers.  It is also a considerable &lsquo;step-down&rsquo; in terms of services trade relative to the previous EU-UK relationship, which is significant as Ireland exports considerably more services than goods to the UK. Therefore, while the newly formed agreement protects Irish firms from the more significant impact of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit scenario, they will still be impacted by the change in trading arrangements. Thus, it represents a smaller Brexit shock for the same sectoral mix of Irish firms as under a no-deal scenario. </p>  <p>  My Department will publish updated macroeconomic forecasts that account for both the Covid-19 and Brexit shocks as part of the Stability Programme Update in April. It is likely that the current restrictions will have a contractionary impact on the economy in the first half of the year. Indeed, their impact on the economy is already evident with many additional people relying on income support schemes as a result. The number of recipients of the PUP stood at 443,000 as of 29th March, an increase of 150,000 since the restrictions were introduced in December, though this remains well below the peak of 600,000 recorded in May last year. </p>  <p>  Crucially, however, the vaccine programme is now underway and there is light at the end of the tunnel. While this process will undoubtedly take time and restrictions will be required in the near term, as the vaccine programme picks up speed, restrictions will gradually be eased, allowing an economic recovery will take hold. </p></reply>

However, the Act also recognises that in certain cases such protection is not necessary or would be inappropriate and it provides for a number of limited exemptions to this statutory obligation where: </p>  <p>  a. the house in respect of which the loan is made is, in the mortgage lender's opinion, not intended for use as the principal residence of the borrower or of his or her dependants;</p>  <p>  b. loans to persons who belong to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to an insurer, or which would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally;</p>  <p>  c. loans to persons who are over 50 years of age at the time the loan is approved;</p>  <p>  d. loans to persons who, at the time the loan is made, have otherwise arranged life assurance, providing for payment of a sum, in the event of death, of not less than the amount of the estimated outstanding principal amount. </p>  <p>  It is not necessary for a prospective mortgage borrower to seek or apply for an exemption from this statutory requirement as the Act makes clear that the legal requirement on mortgage lenders to arrange for mortgage protection insurance does not apply in such cases; also I do not think it would be desirable to be more proscriptive in legislation in regard to these statutory exemptions.  If a prospective borrower is of the view that a particular lender is taking an unduly restrictive approach to these statutory exemptions then it will be possible for the borrower to utilise the complaints process as provided for in Chapter 10 of the Consumer Protection Code and if that process does not resolve the matter then a complaint can be made to the statutory and independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. </p>  <p>  However, it may also be the case that, in circumstances where there is no specific statutory obligation on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance in association with a housing loan, an individual mortgage lender may, as a matter of its own commercial policy, require a mortgage borrower to put in place such an insurance policy as a condition for obtaining mortgage credit.  That would be a commercial decision as opposed to a statutory requirement for an individual mortgage lender and it is not possible for me to instruct lenders on their commercial lending policies or their commercial decisions on any individual mortgage application, including the insurance and other security they require either in respect of the borrower or the secured property in relation to a mortgage loan. </p>  <p>  In the same way it is not possible for me interfere with the decisions insurance companies may make on applications for life insurance cover or direct such companies to provide cover to specific individuals. That is also a commercial matter and decision for individual insurers to make in line with their own risk policies and analysis.  However, if a mortgage lender requires a consumer to hold a policy of insurance related to a housing loan, the lender is obliged to accept a policy selected by the consumer provided that such a policy has a level of guarantee equivalent to the amount that would be required to repay the outstanding credit or to insure the value of the security.  Also in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on insurance, the Central Bank expects that the insurance industry will play its part in protecting its customers during this difficult time and it expects that firms will consider the customer impact when making decisions and to engage with customers in an open, fair and transparent manner. </p>  <p>  If a person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider or insurance provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage or for life insurance, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, including the requirement for the regulated entity to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers, the consumer can also complain directly to the regulated entity and, if not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the consumer can refer the complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  In relation to mortgage refusals, the Central Bank has indicated that it does not receive or hold data regarding the number of mortgage applications declined by regulated mortgage lenders or the reasons why applications are refused. However, the Consumer Protection Code provides that where a personal consumer's formal application for credit is turned down by a regulated entity, the entity must clearly outline to the personal consumer why the credit was not approved.  Also the regulated entity must offer to provide the reasons, on paper or another durable medium, to the personal consumer.  </p></reply>

The year-on-year deterioration was primarily due to increases in voted expenditure with total net voted expenditure in 2020 amounting to &euro;67,849 million.  This was &euro;13,703 million, or 25.3%, ahead of the same period in 2019. This rise in expenditure reflects increased departmental drawdown in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the areas of health and social protection. </p><p>In terms of revenue, tax receipts of &euro;57,165 million collected in 2020 were down by 3.6% or &euro;2,149 million on the previous year, with corporation tax growth as well as resilient income tax receipts combining to compensate for steep declines in the other tax heads, in particular in VAT and excise duties.</p><p>The cost of the three main income and business support schemes in 2021 is over &euro;1 billion per month. The ultimate cost of the current phase of restrictions will depend on the speed at which restrictions can be lifted and the economy opens up. However, a deficit of at least as large as in 2020 is expected again in 2021.</p><p><b>Costs to the Economy </b></p><p>Although Ireland entered the Covid-19 induced crisis from a position of strength, with robust growth, balanced public finances and a labour market close to full employment, the outbreak of the pandemic turned the economy on its head in the space of a few weeks.  Restrictions were introduced which resulted in a sharp contraction in economic activity.  However, the strong performance of the multinational sector last year, of pharmaceuticals and ICT in particular, meant that the Irish economy grew last year, with GDP growth of almost 3 &frac12; per cent recorded for 2020 as a whole. </p><p>GDP figures however mask a severe hit to the domestic economy. Modified domestic demand, which provides a better measure of domestic activity, declined by 5.4 per cent in 2020, with domestic-facing sectors, such as hospitality, leisure and education, bearing the brunt of the economic impact. These are labour-intensive sectors and so it follows that the pandemic had a significant impact on the labour market, with an unemployment rate of about 19 per cent recorded in 2020. </p><p>Covid-19 restrictions continue to weigh on the domestic economy. Indeed, the impact of the current restrictions is already evident, with many additional people relying on state income supports as a result. The number of recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment stood at approximately 450,000 as of 22<sup>nd</sup>March, an increase of around 172,000 from the beginning of Level 5 restrictions in December, but remaining well below the peak of 600,000 recorded in May last year. Crucially, however, the vaccine programme is now underway and there is light at the end of the tunnel. While this process will undoubtedly take time and restrictions will be required in the near term, as the vaccine programme picks up speed and the public health situation improves these restrictions will gradually be eased and an economic recovery will take hold. </p></reply>

Therefore, the information required for an estimate of the cost incurred should the VAT on personal alarms be reduced to a lower rate is not available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.809.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100086#WRP00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331 and 332 together.</p>  <p>  Since the COVID-19 situation first arose, I have maintained contact with the BPFI and lenders on the measures they have put in place to assist their customers who are economically impacted by the pandemic.  In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who are on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Illicit financial flows drain resources from sustainable development, exacerbate inequalities, weaken governance and damage public trust. </p><p>The FACTI Panel has made recommendations for tackling illicit financial flows. As a long-standing member of the international <b>Financial Actions Task Force (FATF)</b>and an EU Member State, Ireland adheres to the highest global standards of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Terrorist Financing - &quot;AML/CFT&quot; - and actively supports and implements measures to combat such activities.</p><p>The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Act 2021, which transposes the 5th AML Directive, was enacted on 18 March 2021 and will be commenced in the coming weeks. While this legislation was advanced by the Department of Justice, my Department is progressing certain matters of relevance to financial services. These include: the establishment of a Register of Beneficial Ownership for trusts; a Register of Beneficial Ownership for bank and payment accounts and safe-deposit boxes; and the introduction of a registration and supervision regime, for AML/CFT purposes, for Virtual Asset Service Providers. The EU and FATF are clear and I agree, that all of these measures are necessary to combat financial crime and illicit financial flows. </p><p>Furthermore, the latest FATF Mutual Evaluation Review of Ireland was conducted in 2017 and found that &ldquo;<i>Ireland has a sound and substantially effective regime to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing</i>&rdquo;.  To ensure active consideration of current and emerging AML/CFT risks in Ireland's financial and non-financial sectors, my Department chairs the Anti-money Laundering Steering Committee, comprised of members from across many Government Departments and agencies, such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Revenue Commissioners. Currently, that committee is overseeing the implementation of an Action Plan to further enhance Ireland's AML/CFT framework, in accordance with the recommendations arising from the FATF review. Of 206 actions necessitating the consideration of numerous stakeholders, over half have already been fully addressed. These actions will further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s AML/CFT regime and ensure that mitigation measures are in place to protect against illicit financial flows.  </p><p><b>International Tax</b></p><p>Aggressive tax planning is a global problem and is best solved by global cooperation. In this context, Ireland engaged constructively in the BEPS process and importantly, we have reformed and modernised our tax code in recent years to effectively address aggressive tax planning. Ireland continues to work constructively with all 139 members of the Inclusive Framework, on an equal footing, to address these issues and build an international tax framework that is fair, robust and sustainable.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are currently studying the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p>Ireland is committed to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, and is one of the 139 jurisdictions working together on an equal footing to address the tax challenges arising from digitalisation. Ireland has seen the benefits of international cooperation and is committed to the ongoing global discussions to address the tax challenges arising from digitalisation.  We are hopeful that a sustainable, robust and growth-friendly agreement will be reached this year which meets the needs of all countries, large and small, developed and developing.</p><p>As outlined in the update to <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap </i>published earlier this year Ireland is committed to continue to meet international best practices on exchange of information and support efforts to further enhance information exchange.  </p><p>Tax transparency is key to ensuring fair and effective taxation and Ireland is fully committed to maintaining the highest international best practice standards developed by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. It should be noted that of the 78 jurisdictions reviewed to date by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, Ireland is one of only a small number of jurisdictions to have been found to be fully compliant with new international best practice.</p><p>Ireland is at the forefront of the further development of the International EOI framework both in the EU and in the OECD and is actively working with other jurisdictions including through the EU Fiscalis Programme and the OECD Forum on Tax Administration.</p><p>Ireland has been proactive at the OECD in shaping the Model Rules for Reporting by Platform Operators with respect to Sellers in the Sharing and Gig Economy (MRDP) that were agreed July and will bring the sharing and gig economy within the scope of Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). Ireland is also active in shaping proposals at EU level such as our proactive participation in developing the various Directives on Administrative Cooperation. For instance, DAC7 which was adopted last week, will extend the EU tax transparency rules to digital platforms. EU Member States will automatically exchange information on income generated by sellers on digital platforms. </p><p>Ireland is fully committed to contributing to the development of new reporting rules for crypto-assets and e-Money to complement the Common Reporting Standard. This will feed into a European Commission proposal in this area (DAC8) which is expected towards the end of 2021 and Ireland looks forward to engaging with our EU partners on this proposal.</p><p>Ireland supports transparency and good governance for corporates including &ldquo;country-by-country&rdquo; reporting by MNEs to national tax authorities. The Finance Act 2015 introduced obligations for relevant companies to report to the Revenue Commissioners in line with agreements on tax transparency agreed as part of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project.</p><p>In relation to public country by country reporting, a proposal by the European Commission for a Directive to amend Directive 2013/34/EU (the Accounting Directive) as regards disclosure of income tax information by certain undertakings and branches was recently discussed at COMPET Council. Ireland opposed this proposal as the legal base is not in keeping with the Treaties and that as it relates to tax, it should be the responsibility of Finance Ministers to negotiate at the ECOFIN Council rather than at COMPET Council. Ireland&rsquo;s principled position is shared by a number of other Member States and indeed the Council Legal Service.  Notwithstanding Ireland's stated views regarding the legal basis, this proposal now has the necessary support to proceed from COMPET Council.  Ireland is engaging constructively in the negotiations on this proposal.</p></reply>

The support was paid via the employer so as to maintain employment links between the employee and employer insofar as was possible and, to that end, the rate of Employers' PRSI was also significantly reduced to 0.5%. The level of income given to each individual employee was based on previous wages received in January and February 2020. Over 66,500 employers received a subsidy under the TWSS with payments worth just under &euro;2.9 billion paid out to a total of 664,000 workers.</p>  <p>  The TWSS was intended to facilitate the retention of the employer/employee relationship in relevant cases, thereby supporting the early recommencement of normal business when conditions allowed. There was no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business had closed due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or had continued to trade with employees continuing to work part-time or work full time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  An employer who received TWSS payments under the scheme was obliged to pass on any such payments to its employees. Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing TWSS compliance programme is specifically examining that employers adhered to that requirement, as well as examining employer/employee eligibility for the TWSS.</p>  <p>  The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income for the duration of the scheme and the position in relation to the TWSS did not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay, sick pay or pension schemes.</p>  <p>  However, the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, the question of what wages an employer would be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of hours worked and the question of an employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees at pre-COVID levels in the light of the impact of the pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, are outside the remit of the TWSS.</p>  <p>  As with the decision around whether to avail of the TWSS in the first place, the question of whether an employer would recover amounts from its employees in any particular circumstance is a matter between the employer and the relevant employees. Where an employer takes such steps they are obliged to comply with the formalities of the PAYE deduction system and reflect in their payroll submissions to Revenue the actual position regarding gross and net pay as well as income tax, USC and PRSI deductions for each employee so impacted. These adjustments may materially affect each employee&rsquo;s end of year position for 2020 and a failure by an employer in any such cases to accurately correct the records would be regarded as a breach of the PAYE Regulations.</p></reply>

Under the relevant legislation, the scheme is due to expire at the end of next month but the flexibility is there to extend it further to the end of the year subject to certain statutory procedures being followed. </p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 59,172 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 25 March 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;9,722,399, and the potential tax cost is &euro;1,944,480, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. As at 25 March, 3,145 service providers have registered for the scheme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted.   Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.  </p>  <p>  Decisions on next steps relating to the scheme have yet to be taken. However, I would make the point that Stay and Spend should not be viewed in isolation from the other significant measures put in place to support businesses generally, including the hospitality sector. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary but important measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity.  It will apply until 31 December 2021.  It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality. </p>  <p>  Also, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond. I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as announced by Government last month, the scheme is being extended in its enhanced form to the end of June 2021.  </p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Work is underway in relation to certain areas, including:</p><p>-  implementing the new Personal Injuries Guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum<i>via</i>further amendments to the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019</i>;</p><p>-  examining legal changes to the <i>duty of care</i>;</p><p>-  reducing <i>insurance fraud and placing perjury </i>on a statutory footing, making the offence easier to prosecute;</p><p>-  strengthening the legal enforcement powers of the <i>Competition and Consumer Protection Commission</i>; and</p><p>-  enhancing the role of the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board</i>, including through legislative change.</p><p>In addition to this work, there has been recent intensive engagement with key stakeholders by Minister of State Fleming, including meetings with the major insurers, the Alliance for Insurance Reform and industry representatives Insurance Ireland. He is due to meet with the major insurers again in the coming weeks.  Separately, an <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>has been recently established within the Department of Finance and work is underway to increase market transparency through the <i>National Claims Information Database (NCID)</i>, including for employer and public liability insurance.</p><p>With regard to the specific issue of the cost of motor insurance premiums, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to data from the Central Bank&rsquo;s NCID <i>Private Motor Insurance Report 2</i>, published in November. This shows the average earned premium for private motor insurance decreased by 9 per cent to the end of 2019 from its mid-2018 peak. I would reasonably expect that the next report &ndash; covering 2020 &ndash; will show further reductions. Separately, the most recent data from the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s Consumer Price Index indicates that motor premiums have reduced by just over 30 per cent from their July 2016 peak. While for methodological reasons, these datasets are not directly comparable, both have indicated the same downward trend for some time. This in part reflects the positive work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, and it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to build on this success <i>via</i>the new Action Plan.</p><p>In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a priority issue for this Government.  Both I and Minister of State Fleming will continue to play a lead role in this policy area.</p></reply>

The tax liabilities that may be deferred or &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; are VAT, PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments due to be refunded to Revenue by employers, and certain self-assessed income tax liabilities.  </p>  <p>  To be eligible for income tax warehousing, taxpayers have to declare that they estimated their total income for 2020 would be at least 25% less than their total income for 2019 and where applicable, that their total income for 2021 will be at least 25% less than their total income for 2019.</p>  <p>  In the case of VAT, PAYE (Employer) and excess TWSS liabilities, Period 1 refers to the period when a business has been unable to trade due to the Covid-19 related restrictions and includes the first full two monthly VAT period after the business resumes trading.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that where a business re-opened but has had to close again due to the re-imposition of restrictions, the trade is deemed to be still subject to the restrictions provided for in the regulations under sections 5 and 31A Health Act 1947 until it has re-opened again.  This means that VAT, PAYE (Employer) and excess TWSS liabilities for such businesses can continue to be warehoused in respect of the extended restricted period.  </p>  <p>  The end date for Period 1, and consequently the period for which liabilities can be warehoused, will vary from business to business depending on the restrictions affecting that business.  However, in all cases, Period 1 will include the duration for which a business is subject to trading restrictions plus the first full VAT period after the restrictions have been lifted and the business resumes trading.   </p>  <p>  Businesses in the entertainment sector that are currently eligible for warehousing will continue to be able to warehouse their liabilities from Period 1 until the restrictions for that sector are lifted.</p>  <p>  Following the expiration of Period 1, businesses are afforded a further 12 months (&ldquo;Period 2&rdquo;) during which collection of warehoused liabilities will be deferred.  No interest will be charged on outstanding Covid-19 liabilities in either Period 1 or Period 2.  Payment of warehoused debts will not commence until after Period 2.  Interest on warehoused liabilities is charged from this point on at c. 3% per annum until the liabilities are paid in full. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.849.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100086#WRP04600"><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the responsibility for competition policy rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body that is responsible for the enforcement of competition law in Ireland. I would welcome the introduction of new lenders to the Irish market.</p>  <p>  When considering competition in any market, two key aspects are the range of products available to all sectors and the pricing of those products. All the retail banks have extensive product ranges, so continued supply should not, for the most part, be a cause for concern. Indeed, it is worth noting that the provision of financial services is evolving rapidly. Innovations in the FinTech space and new initiatives from credit unions and An Post are resulting in the provision of new services and products all the time.</p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is concentrated, with five retail banks accounting for the majority of new mortgage lending, and three retail banks accounting for the majority of new bank lending to SMEs. However, the wider context is one of improving competition in the provision of financial services, with new entrants to both bank and non-bank lending markets for households and businesses in Ireland already announced.  Indeed, it is a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market.  This will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers who may wish to consider switching to a new lender. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank recognises that the relatively lower levels of competition in the Irish retail banking market may be one contributing factor to average interest rates for mortgage and SME lending being higher in Ireland than the Eurozone average. The wider context is one of improving competition in the provision of financial services, with new entrants to both bank and non-bank lending markets for households and businesses in Ireland either already announced or likely in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Price competition is possible even in a concentrated system. The Irish mortgage market in particular is interesting in this regard. Since 2015, headline interest rates have fallen substantially for household and SME borrowers in Ireland despite a relatively small number of participants. Trends show that interest rates in Ireland have been falling in recent years, providing benefit to consumers. Interest rates on fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.79% in January 2021. The weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements declined by 2 basis points to 2.65% in January 2021, the lowest level since data has been collected on a comparable basis. </p>  <p>  There have also been reductions in interest rates on loans to SMEs from 5.19% to 3.95% over the period Q1 2015 to Q4 2020, as well as reductions in interest rates on consumer loans (for example, from 8.3% to 6.66% on APRC consumer loans from January 2015 to January 2021).</p>  <p>  The Department of Finance published a paper in 2019 by Indecon Consulting on an Evaluation of the Concept of Community Banking in Ireland. This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by the Department of Finance in 2018. The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.  </p>  <p>  Credit unions are increasing the offering of financial products for their members. The Credit Union Act, 1997 (the 1997 Act) and the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016 set out the services that credit unions may provide to their members. These include loans and savings under the 1997 Act and a further suite of services under the 2016 Regulations such as third party payments; ATM services; bureau de change and certain insurance services on an agency basis. I understand that a number of credit unions provide some of the services provided for under the 2016 Regulations. Where a credit union wishes to provide other services to its members, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such services in accordance with the provisions set out in sections 48-51 of the 1997 Act.</p>  <p>  One such additional service includes the Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS). In 2016, the Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework. </p>  <p>  An Post offers financial services including a payment account, personal loans, credit cards, a range of insurances, money transmission and foreign exchange services. An Post offers counter services for a number of retail banks, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches. There is there is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within five kilometres. An Post offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches. </p>  <p>  Bank of Ireland has also recently announced the closure of 88 branches in the Republic of Ireland, alongside this, it also announced a new partnership with An Post to provide a range of banking services means that there will be a post office within, on average, less than 500 metres of the branches that are being closed. The Bank confirmed that the new partnership with An Post will be available to all Bank of Ireland customers before any branch closes. </p></reply>

The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland means that no new procedures apply to goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The Government and State Agencies have been providing, and continue to provide, a range of advisory, financial and upskilling supports to assist businesses in moving goods, to, from or through Great Britain.  Further information is provided on <i>Gov.ie/Brexit</i>.</p><p>It is clear from the first three months trading under the new conditions that some businesses had undertaken extensive preparations and have adapted well to the new requirements. This is evident in that currently over 80% of freight vehicle movements are being green routed and are therefore permitted to leave the ports without any interaction with Customs or the other regulatory authorities on arrival in Ireland.  </p><p>It should be noted that, due to the nature of the goods traded with the UK e.g. high levels of foodstuffs, there will always be a level of documentary or physical examination of goods movements required as part of Ireland&rsquo;s obligation to protect the Single Market and the Customs Union. In practical terms this means that there will never be a scenario where all goods (i.e.100%) arriving into Ireland from Great Britain will be green routed.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that some businesses were less well prepared or underestimated the level of preparations required and have found compliance with the new requirements challenging. Additionally, the tight timeframes involved in the just-in-time business model, which underpins trade with the UK, puts additional pressure on the supply chain to gather the detailed information required to complete customs and SPS declarations. </p><p>Revenue is aware that some goods movements are being &lsquo;orange routed&rsquo; due to unfamiliarity with the new requirements. In such instances, Revenue and other State Agencies actively work with the relevant responsible parties in the supply chain to overcome and rectify the issues as quickly as possible. In time, dealing with the customs and other regulatory formalities that now apply to goods moving to, from or through Great Britain will become routine for importers, transport companies and truck drivers. Revenue is continuing to work closely with individual businesses and business representative bodies to assist them in building capability and understanding so as to be able to complete the relevant customs and other regulatory requirements. </p><p>The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) was agreed very late last year which did not allow much time for businesses to tailor their preparations, particularly in relation to rules of origin requirements, which are fundamental to allowing tariff free trade with the UK. Where additional guidance was needed this has been provided by Revenue via eCustoms Notifications. 30 such notifications have been issued so far in 2021. These are available on the Revenue website and are also emailed to anyone who has subscribed to the mailing list. Information is also available through Revenue&rsquo;s Brexit Latest News. </p><p>I am advised that since 1 January 2021 Revenue has:</p><p>-  provided important Customs advice to hauliers and truck drivers moving goods from Great Britain (GB) into Irish ports regarding creating a Pre-Boarding Notification (PBN) and the channel routing look up facility.</p><p>-  issued a detailed step by step guide (including screenshots from the systems) on how to create and, if necessary, edit a PBN for import and export declarations.</p><p>-  provided information and clarification on the correct procedure for completing an Entry Summary Declaration (ENS) for Roll-On Roll-Off ferry movements.</p><p>-  provided, on a temporary basis, an administrative easement and support service for businesses who are experiencing difficulties in lodging their safety &amp;amp; security ENS declaration. </p><p>-  engaged with representative bodies for freight forwarders. </p><p>-  engaged with shipping companies in relation to companies having difficulties in boarding ferries in Great Britain.</p><p>-  issued stakeholder group updates.</p><p>-  engaged with individual businesses to resolve matters specific to their business models.</p><p>-  provided significant support to businesses through its range of support services including our 24/7 Customs telephone helpline ((01) 7383685).</p><p>Additionally, since 1 January Revenue has participated in 36 events aimed at providing additional supports to businesses and trade representative bodies. This engagement has been extremely positive, and Revenue has been able to work with businesses in identifying solutions to their specific issues and to help mitigate some of the impacts of the UKs departure from the EU. Revenue will continue to work with trade and business, on both a collective and individual basis, to assist them in addressing the challenges and issues arising from the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. Customs and other State agency officials are working on a 24/7 basis at Dublin and Rosslare ports and in Dublin Airport, and will work with businesses to resolve issues as quickly as possible. </p><p>Revenue is actively working with the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM) and the HSE&rsquo;s Environmental Health Officers (EHO) to improve interagency communication, to increase the opportunities to share data thereby reducing the requirement for trade to submit the same data to multiple State Agencies and to streamline processes in as far as is practicable. However, additional data requirements apply to SPS and controlled goods movements beyond those required for standard customs clearance purposes and in such circumstances documentary requirements can and will arise which have not previously been supplied as part of the engagement with Customs in any particular instance. </p><p>I know that Revenue continues to work to optimise the efficiency with which legitimate trade can be processed, subject to the need for Ireland to play its part in protecting the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union and compliance with the overarching UCC legal framework and other similar frameworks such as the Official Control Regulations. </p></reply>

In January of 2020, my Department published a high-level update to its economic fiscal and forecasts in the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy. At that stage, tax revenues for 2020 were estimated at &euro;63.5 billion, which would have represented growth of 7 per cent on the record 2019 performance of &euro;59.3 billion.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of Covid-19 on our economy and public finances, tax receipts in 2020 ultimately amounted to &euro;57.2 billion, some &euro;6.3 billion under the initial, pre-Covid projections published in January and by &euro;2.1 billion, or 3.6 per cent on 2019.</p>  <p>  However, the decline in tax revenues in the year was not as steep as had been feared. Although most revenue streams declined sharply, continuing growth in corporation tax receipts, and a remarkable resilience in income tax receipts, helped to prevent a more severe deterioration. Income tax receipts were down only 1 per cent in 2020, which is a testament to the highly progressive nature of our tax system. Unfortunately the worst affected sectors of the economy were dominated by relatively low wage earners, so most of those who lost their employment as a result of the pandemic were outside the income tax net. </p>  <p>  The Government has acted to support those out of work through the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Just under &euro;5 billion was spent on PUP payments last year and the Government is committed to continuing to help those who have lost their jobs under the current restrictions.</p></reply>

This, and a resilience in income tax receipts, boosted the fiscal position and prevented a more severe deterioration in the public finances.</p>  <p>  These receipts are welcome, and a reflection of the success of our industrial policy in attracting high-quality firms to Ireland. There is evidence that, in particular, the pharmaceutical, ICT and financial sectors have contributed to the record level of receipts received in 2020. The continued strength in corporation tax revenues means that we are borrowing less than would otherwise be the case.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy will be aware, I have stated on many occasions that corporation tax receipts are subject to exceptional volatility and unpredictability. Receipts are vulnerable to the business decisions of a relatively small number of large, multinational firms. </p>  <p>  Additionally, forthcoming changes to the international tax regime are likely to negatively impact upon revenues. My Department has projected that the implementation of the OECD BEPS reforms may lead to fall of &euro;500 million per annum in corporation tax receipts from 2022 onwards. Corporation tax receipts are not a sustainable basis upon which to make permanent expenditure commitments. </p>  <p>  My Department will be updating its medium-term forecast of corporation tax receipts as part of the Stability Programme Update in April. </p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19.  For those borrowers, lenders are expected to engage with them in an effective way and in line with the requirements of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Consumer Protection Code and regulations on lending to SMEs to deliver appropriate and sustainable solutions and facilitate as many borrowers as possible to return to repaying their debt.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the reintroduction of mortgage payment breaks, the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support at this time. </p></reply>

Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.</p><p>This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 is at the discretion of the employer. The value of relief allowed under the Irish system is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers. The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally: at &euro;3.20 per day up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum may be paid tax free. By contrast, the weekly rate in the UK is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum.</p><p>Revenue also advises that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.</p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home.</p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end. Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.</p><p>Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax which may be viewed at the following link: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-13.pdf</i>.</p><p>Finally, the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, commits the Tax Strategy Group to reviewing the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The Tax Strategy Group will take account of the economic, financial and organisational implications arising from the experience of remote working during the pandemic, and assess the merits of further enhancements for consideration in the context of Budget 2022.</p></reply>

An <i>Exchequer</i>deficit of this level is consistent with a <i>general government</i>deficit of c. &euro;19 billion, or around 5 &frac12; per cent of GDP. </p><p>The year-on-year deterioration in the public finances was primarily driven by large increases in current and capital spending as Government responded to Covid-19. </p><p>Overall, revenue proved remarkably resilient, with persistent strength in income tax receipts and further growth in corporation tax compensating to an extent for steep declines in other tax streams, particularly on VAT and excise duties.

The analyses covered a range of outcomes and possible future relationships between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  The analyses included a limited Free Trade Agreement (FTA) based on zero tariffs and zero quotas on the goods side with very little covered in respect of services. Overall this is broadly in line with the recently concluded new Trade and Cooperation Agreement.</p>  <p>  Under this Free Trade Agreement scenario, the research found that the level of GDP would be around 2  per cent lower over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) and around 3 per cent lower over the long-term (i.e. 10 years), compared to a situation where the UK remained in the EU. </p>  <p>  The conclusion of the Trade and Cooperation agreement is positive for the Irish economy compared to a no-deal scenario, as it will provide for zero-tariffs and zero-quota trade for qualifying EU and UK goods. It does not, however, mitigate against all &lsquo;trade frictions&rsquo;. Non-tariff barriers remain in the form of customs check, rules of origin requirements, and regulatory requirements. It is also very limited in respect of services.</p>  <p>  The most recent trade data, published by the CSO in March, showed that the momentum in export growth seen throughout 2020 has taken a hit in the first month of 2021, with non-pharma exports to the UK recording a significant annual decline. Imports from the UK in all sectors also recorded a very substantial fall. </p>  <p>  However, further data will be necessary to fully assess the short-term impact of Brexit, and the Department of Finance will continue to carefully monitor these developments.</p>  <p>  In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional analysis was also jointly undertaken with the ESRI in 2020. The research found that that the long term impacts of Brexit were broadly in line with analyses undertaken prior to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the Irish Government remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples livelihood&rsquo;s to the greatest extent possible. </p></reply>

The scheme supplements other Covid-related supports such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).</p>  <p>  The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan.  The details of the scheme are set out in Finance Act 2020 and guidelines on the operation of the scheme, including the eligibility criteria, are available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, a business must, under the specific terms of the regulations, be required to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing its business premises to purchase goods or services, with the result that, during the period of restrictions, turnover does not exceed an amount based on 25% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in 2020 in the case of a new business).</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Revenue guidelines on CRSS is to assist businesses in understanding the scope of the scheme; to assist them in assessing their eligibility for the scheme; and to provide information on how to make a claim. The guidelines are updated by Revenue on a regular basis to address common queries raised by taxpayers and to provide information on any developments relating to the scheme, such as the impact of any change in the levels of restrictions.  The guidelines published on 4 December 2020 did not introduce new conditionality but rather were updated to address common queries and issues raised by taxpayers in relation to the eligibility criteria and to provide further information on how to make a claim under the scheme, including in respect of the &ldquo;restart week&rdquo;, which was available to eligible businesses on the easing of Covid restrictions in early December.</p>  <p>  Guidelines published by Revenue on the operation of CRSS are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in legislation. Revenue does not have the flexibility to extend the scheme beyond the terms of the legislation.</p>  <p>  The scheme commenced on 13 October 2020 and operates on a self-assessment basis. A person registering their details and details of their business activity for the purposes of making a claim under the scheme should retain evidence supporting their basis for making a claim. Where a person&rsquo;s registration application or claim is selected for verification by Revenue, Revenue will request such evidence to verify the person&rsquo;s entitlement to make a claim under the scheme based on the eligibility and qualification criteria as set out in legislation.</p></reply>

The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer in Q1 and Q2 2021 compared with the same period in 2019.  </p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  </p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputies will be aware from announcements made on 23 February, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of June 2021. This will be at the enhanced rates of subsidy introduced with effect from late last October.</p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  I am therefore satisfied that the design of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) fully takes account of the changing environment around living with the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

HTB was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of the &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo;. </p><p>An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis. One of the main aims of the policy underpinning the design of HTB was to help encourage the building of additional new properties. By restricting the scheme solely to new dwellings and new self-builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes will encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. In accordance with a commitment in the Programme for Government, HTB was enhanced in July 2020.  It is too soon to draw conclusions as to the impact of the enhancements on supply. </p><p>HTB has been the subject of two independent reviews: an impact assessment (2017), and a full Cost Benefit Analysis (2018), both carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. </p><p>The report of the impact assessment was published as part of Budget 2018 documents and is available at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>The report of the Cost Benefit Analysis was published on the day of Budget 2019, in the Department of Finance Report on Tax Expenditures, and is available at the following link: </p><p><i>www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2019/Documents/Tax%20Expenditures%20Report%20Budget%202019.pdf</i>.</p><p>In brief, the 2018 CBA, confirmed the findings of the independent review as follows:</p><p><b>-  Prices: </b>While there might have been a very small increase in prices attributable to the introduction of the incentive, the primary driver of house prices remained the continued misalignment between demand and supply.</p><p><b>-  Supply: </b>The evidence suggested that following the introduction of the incentive there was a marked increase in supply which can be attributed in part to HTB.</p><p><b>-  Affordability: </b>The analysis also found that availability of HTB had reduced the time to save for all claimants and improved the overall affordability of housing for these individuals.</p><p><b>-  Benefit/Cost Ratio:</b>The analysis found a benefit-cost ratio of 1.28 indicating a moderate positive effect for the incentive.</p><p>Finally, in relation to impacts on house prices, to the extent that data are available at this point, Revenue advise me that for 2020 the average purchase price relating to HTB claims to December 31 2020 was &euro;329,000 which was the same as the figure for 2019.</p></reply>

These guidelines provided regulatory flexibility to banks who offered borrowers a temporary payment break due to COVID-19. These guidelines were originally applicable until 30 June 2020 and their application was subsequently extended by the EBA until 30 September 2020. </p>  <p>  On the 21 September 2020 the EBA announced that they would phase out the Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative payment moratoria in line with its previous 30 September deadline. However, the EBA announced on the 2 December 2020 that they would reactivate their Guidelines and they applied until 31 March 2021. At that time the EBA also updated the guidelines so that they only apply to loans which have had payments suspended, postponed or reduced by not more than 9 months in total. </p>  <p>  Since the onset of the Pandemic, I and my Department, have had ongoing engagement with the retail banking sector to ensure that borrowers impacted by COVID-19 were receiving adequate support.</p>  <p>  I met with the CEO&rsquo;s of the five main retail banks and the BPFI on 18 March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to discuss the actions that were taking place to assist the customers who were affected by the pandemic. At this time payment breaks were introduced by the industry under a voluntary programme and their introduction in this way allowed for a rapid response and the provision of immediate relief to impacted borrowers.</p>  <p>  Following on from this in May and July 2020, I met with representatives of the retail banks again to discuss the supports that business and mortgage customers were receiving during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  On 28 September 2020, I along with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, met with the retail banks and the Banking and Payments Federation who agreed to provide suitable supports, both short term and longer term, to borrowers who are experiencing difficulties on a case-by-case basis following the conclusion of the general payment moratoria in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In relation to the accrual of interest on loans during payment breaks, lenders will continue to incur costs (both in respect of funding and enhanced operational requirements) and that other borrowers will continue to be liable for their interest charges.  Payment break measures do not come without cost to the banking sector and these costs will also have to be managed in a way that protects their business and will be as fair as possible to the various stakeholders.  From the outset, I have made it clear to banks that it will not be acceptable for them to make excess profits on payment breaks and that it will be a matter for them to demonstrate that such a situation will not arise.</p>  <p>  I understand that circa ninety percent of borrowers have now returned to full repayment either under existing or extended terms. In respect of borrowers who are still experiencing repayment difficulty at the end of a COVID-19 payment break, mortgage lenders are expected to work with borrowers in a pro-active and sympathetic manner and with the objective of assisting borrowers to meet their mortgage commitments.   </p></reply>

This Communication provides valuable guidance to Member States on the conduct of fiscal policy in the period ahead, including in relation to the application of the General Escape Clause of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>  <p>  In this Communication, the Commission announced that its decision on the continued application of the clause will involve an overall assessment of the state of the EU economy, based on quantitative criteria, in particular the level of economic activity compared to pre-crisis levels. On this basis, the Communication states that current preliminary indications suggest the clause will persist into 2022 before its de-activation in 2023. However, a formal assessment on the continued activation of the clause will only be made by the Commission once its 2021 Spring Forecast is published in early May.</p>  <p>  I am in broad agreement with the approach that has been outlined by the Commission, including the framework for deciding if the General Escape Clause will continue into next year. For as long as the current health and economic crisis remains acute, it is vital for governments to support and protect jobs and businesses. Although policy will need to remain agile and adapt to the prevailing situation, premature withdrawal of fiscal support should be avoided. </p>  <p>  It is in this context, that my fellow Eurogroup finance ministers and I recently committed to a supportive policy stance in the euro area in 2021 and 2022. The support put in place at the European level, notably the Next Generation EU initiative and the Recovery and Resilience Facility, will be very important in this regard. The Eurogroup agreed that once the recovery is firmly under way, governments should implement sustainable medium-term fiscal strategies to tackle the increased levels of public debt. </p>  <p>  On the broader question of reform of the EU fiscal rules, it is important to recall that there have been several overhauls of the Stability and Growth Pact since its inception, including most recently following the Global Financial Crisis, through the adoption of the Six-pack and Two-pack legislative packages. Early last year, the Commission opened a formal review of the Six- and Two-pack, including the launch of a public consultation on the operation of the fiscal rules in February 2020. Discussions around this review were paused because of the pandemic, with the public consultation suspended.  I welcome the confirmation by the Commission in their Communication that they intend to relaunch the public debate on the fiscal framework when the recovery takes hold.  My officials and I will actively engage in these discussions. In particular, I support efforts to enhance the transparency, predictability and simplicity of the rules. However, it must be recognised that there are difficult trade-offs involved. This means that finding agreement will be challenging.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the Code under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The provisions of the Code are binding on regulated entities and must, at all times, be complied with by regulated entities.</p><p>The Code is a key component of the strong consumer protection framework in place for consumers of regulated financial service providers and sits alongside other statutory rules such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, SME Regulations and many conduct rules contained in various EU Directives. The Code sets out the requirements that regulated entities must comply with when dealing with consumers in order to ensure a similar level of protection for consumers, regardless of the type of financial services provider. The Code sets out important protections in a range of areas, including in relation to pre-contractual and post-sale information, assessing suitability, claims processing, error and complaints resolution, arrears handling and advertising.</p><p>Since 2012, the Code has been strengthened a number of times, <i>via addenda</i>, to provide additional protections for consumers. These amendments include new requirements around variable rate mortgages, mortgage switching measures, and intermediary inducements.</p><p>A review of the Code is currently underway by the Central Bank.  A public consultation on the Central Bank&rsquo;s proposals for amendments will take place in 2021 giving all stakeholders an opportunity to make submissions. This review will also include transferring the Code into regulations in line with the regulation making powers given to the Central Bank in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.</p><p>The Central Bank has advised me that it continues to give focus to the Consumer Protection Codes in both its supervisory and enforcement work.</p><p>It is important to note that the Central Bank&rsquo;s work to protect consumers is delivered across the entirety of the Bank, and is not just confined to the Code. The breadth of its mandate enables it to harness its collective wide-ranging policy, economic, financial stability and regulatory expertise in working to protect consumers.  The stability of the system, and the resilience of firms within it, are as essential in protecting consumers and investors as our statutory codes of conduct, policy development, assertive supervision, authorisation gatekeeping and robust enforcement powers.</p><p>On the issue of enforcement, the Central Bank has a strong track record of taking enforcement action, with a significant focus on consumer protection in this regard.</p><p>The Central Bank has concluded 142 cases under the ASP framework with fines imposed of over &euro;165.9m. Of the 142 outcomes, 22 were imposed against individuals. The Central Bank has also taken action to revoke 28 firms&rsquo; authorisations on an involuntary basis. A further 13 firms were refused authorisation to undertake regulated activities. </p><p>While the Central Bank&rsquo;s enforcement work spans the entirety of its mandate and is wider than the Code alone, the Central Bank has a strong enforcement record in respect of outcomes which are integral to the Code. In this regard, the three largest monetary sanctions imposed to date by the Central Bank &ndash; Permanent TSB plc sanctioned &euro;21million in 2019, KBC Bank Ireland plc sanctioned &euro;18.3million in 2020 and in March 2021 Ulster Bank sanctioned &euro;37.7million - evidence the Central Bank&rsquo;s commitment to taking robust enforcement action with real deterrence value where serious and significant breaches of the Code are committed.</p><p>In addition, in the first quarter of 2021 the Central Bank delivered the following significant enforcement outcomes:</p><p>-  reprimanded and fined Keystone Insurance Limited for Code breaches relating to overcharging and a failure to communicate fees clearly to customers;</p><p>-  reprimanded and fined J&amp;amp;E Davy for regulatory breaches arising from conflict of interest and identification management and compliance with staff dealing rules under MiFID.</p><p>The Fitness and Probity regime was introduced in 2011. In the Central Bank&rsquo;s role as gatekeeper, 107 applications for pre-approval to the Central Bank were withdrawn following involvement of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Enforcement Division. A further 4 individuals have been refused pre-approval due to fitness and probity concerns. Where the Central Bank identifies individuals in a controlled function who do not comply with the fitness and probity standards the Central Bank will investigate fully and if the evidence supports it, prohibit the individual either indefinitely or for a period of time.</p><p>The Central Bank has issued 9 prohibition notices since 2011. The protection of consumers is one of the key considerations when deciding to prohibit an individual.</p><p>The Central Bank has a broad range of tools, which it carefully deploys in appropriate circumstances, including the imposition of sanctions but up to and including the revocation of authorisations and the refusal and prohibition of individuals. The Central Bank has taken a number of actions in these areas in furtherance of its consumer protection mandate. </p><p>Ultimately for all cases, whether they are specifically based on a breach of the Code, or another sector of legislation, it is important to note that while a case may not have been settled under the Code, protecting consumers is at the centre of all of the Central Bank&rsquo;s enforcement outcomes.</p><p>Regarding legislation to strengthen consumer protection, the Programme for Government includes a Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR), which will be the centrepiece of the forthcoming Central Bank (Amendment) Bill.  The key focus of this legislation is to drive positive behaviour and encourage a culture of high standards that delivers better and fairer outcomes for consumers.</p><p>Officials in my Department are currently engaging with the Attorney General's Office to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are constitutionally sound, and that the correct balance between additional powers for the Central Bank and the protection of individuals' constitutional rights is struck.  This engagement is an iterative and ongoing process, substantial progress has been made on clarifying the legal and constitutional issues to be considered.</p><p>It is my intention that draft heads of Bill will be presented to Government for approval in the near future. </p></reply>

The tax provisions are intended to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.  The section 110 regime enables noteholders to invest through one structured vehicle, without giving rise to an additional layer of tax as compared to a direct investment in the underlying assets.</p>  <p>  Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk and, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing.  It is accepted that having the option for more diversified sources of financing is good for investment and business.  It is also important for financial stability in the economy, as the ability to securitise loan books plays an important role in allowing banks to meet their capital requirement obligations and to continue lending to businesses and individuals.      The section 110 regime is an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s offering as a location for the conduct of financial services. Ireland is not unique in having a securitisation regime, a number of other EU countries have such a regime in place as part of a competitive financial services offering. The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on Capital Markets Union, one of the aims of which is to seek to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that that my officials prepared a report on Real Estate Investment Trusts, Irish Real Estate Funds and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market in 2019. This report was completed and presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July 2019 and informed the amendments to the section 110 regime introduced in Finance Act 2019. These amendments strengthened the significant restrictions to the deductions which a section 110 company can claim for payment of profit participating notes to a specified person. The amendments also placed the section&rsquo;s main purpose test on an objective basis, which enables Revenue to more effectively challenge abuse of the legislation.</p>  <p>  While no formal review is under way, my officials, together with officials in Revenue, continue to monitor the sector on an ongoing basis, with a view to taking further action in future should it be deemed necessary.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.920.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100088#WRR01300"><p>I am aware that the general level of interest rates on new mortgage lending in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries, though it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling.  For example, the interest rates on new fixed rate mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.11% in December 2014 to 2.65% in January 2021. </p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgages can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries making the direct comparison of headline rates not fully consistent. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages such as:-</p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing and restructured loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks;</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  However, the Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for mortgages and other loans.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater benefits for borrowers.</p></reply>

There has been an extensive communications and awareness campaign to communicate this to motor dealers and private individuals. The Revenue Commissioners have advised that the Revenue website alerts customers who are importing used cars from Great Britain after 31 December 2020 that they should factor in increased costs due to VAT at import and customs duty if applicable. It would be neither feasible nor appropriate to attempt to offset any Brexit related cost increases on the importation of cars from Great Britain by reducing Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) rates for those vehicles.</p><p>Customs duties are calculated based on the price paid for the car and any other handling and transport costs. VAT is calculated on the customs duty inclusive amount. It is important to note that the Open Market Selling Price (OMSP) has no bearing on the amount of customs duty or VAT payable on importation into the State. The customs duty and VAT payable on a car imported from Great Britain, with an import value of &euro;20,000, would depend on the origin of the car.</p><p>The table below details the rates of Customs Duty and VAT payable on cars imported from Great Britain depending on their origin. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Origin of car</div></th>       <th><div>Customs Duty   Payable</div></th>       <th><div>VAT Payable</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UK </td>       <td>0%</td>       <td>23%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Third country e.g. Japan</td>       <td>10%</td>       <td>23%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EU e.g. Germany</td>       <td>10%</td>       <td>23%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>A car with an import value of &euro;20,000 imported from Great Britain but originating in a third country, or in the EU, would attract &euro;7,060 in customs duty and VAT. </p><p>Imported cars must be registered in the State within 30 days. Before a vehicle is presented for registration the relevant customs and VAT obligations on importers of cars from Great Britain will need to have been met. At registration the amount of VRT due is calculated based on the OMSP of the vehicle and other factors including the age of the vehicle and its Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions. The OMSP for the most common vehicles, and estimate of the tax due, can be found via the VRT calculator on the Revenue website. There is no provision to provide different VRT rates on the basis of the previous ownership of the vehicle.</p></reply>

With a value of almost &euro;38 billion, or nearly a fifth of national income (GNI*), the budgetary support provided by Government has been extraordinary.  A range of measures were put in place by Government to support people and businesses most affect by the financial shock of the pandemic.  These include the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) and Tourism Business Continuity scheme have also been established in order to support those businesses most at risk, with significant cost to the Exchequer. Other schemes which have been established include the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) and the Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS), both of which are targeted at supporting the commercial live performance sector. It is entirely appropriate that we have acted to support the economy in this way.</p>  <p>  The current crisis is a once-in-a-century event. The fundamentals underlying our economy are strong. We started this crisis from a position of strength &ndash; a budget surplus, cash reserves and significant progress in lowering our debt. Therefore, public finances can absorb this shock, letting debt rise on a one-off basis in order to provide support to the economy.   </p>  <p>  We are committed to restoring the public finances to a sustainable trajectory and ensuring that Ireland does not become a fiscal outlier as we emerge from the pandemic period. It is expected that economic growth will do much to boost taxes and restore the public finances to a sustainable setting.  Once the public health situation allows, pandemic supports must also be unwound in an appropriate and incremental way.  But we must not forget that permanent increases in expenditure must be met by permanent increases in revenue. If the State is to have a larger footprint in the future, this must be paid for.</p>  <p>  We are in a period of unprecedented uncertainty. Once the pandemic has passed and the temporary measures unwound, we will set out a clearer path towards eliminating the deficit over the medium term.  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.</p></reply>

The scheme was not applicable to VAT paid in years prior to 2018. </p>  <p>  The funding for the scheme is capped at &euro;5 million per year and where the total amount of claims in any year exceeds this amount, refunds are paid to charities on a pro-rata basis. Charities can only make one claim per year in respect of the previous year, which must be submitted between 1 January and 30 June. For example, a claim in respect of 2018 had to be made between 1 January 2019 and 30 June 2019. </p>  <p>  Revenue started accepting claims for the scheme in January 2019 in respect of eligible VAT paid by charities in 2018. A total of 1,143 claims were received for that year and as the total amount claimed exceeded the &euro;5m fund, refunds were issued on a pro-rata basis, with the full fund allocated.</p>  <p>  Last year, in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the closing date for submission of claims was extended from 30 June 2020 to 31 August 2020. In total, 910 claims were  received for that year and as the total amount claimed exceeded the &euro;5m fund, refunds were issued on a pro-rata basis, with the full fund allocated.</p>  <p>  Revenue is now accepting claims in respect of eligible VAT paid by charities in 2020 which must be submitted between 1 January and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  As the scheme is now in its third year of operation, it is subject to review. Accordingly, officials of my Department and Revenue are engaged with the sector to review the operation of the scheme.</p></reply>

This was a follow on to a previous paper on Local Public Banking published by my Department in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Indecon report concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a community banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the previous report on Local Public Banking.  The report notes that the Exchequer costs and risks involved would not be justified by the analysis of the causes and extent of market failure. The report also notes concerns over the ability of a new State owned bank to provide effective competition.</p>  <p>  While Indecon&rsquo;s report concluded there are some areas of market failure, it noted that there is extensive provision of and access to banking services through bank branches, credit union offices and An Post branches, as well as a wide range of Exchequer funded existing supports.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding recent announcements in the banking sector, this continues to be the case.</p>  <p>  The Indecon report looked at the credit union sector, and concluded that credit unions are considered to be a &lsquo;community bank&rsquo;.  Credit unions are a key provider of financial services throughout Ireland with assets of &euro;19.6 billion and loans of &euro;5.1 billion, and are continuing to expand the range of services they provide.  The Government is supportive of the Credit Union movement growing as a key provider of community banking in the country.</p>  <p>  The report also looked at An Post, noting that it was increasing its financial offerings and that there is a significant network of post offices in areas where there is no bank branch within five kilometres.  An Post offers counter services for AIB, allowing customers to lodge and withdraw cash at An Post branches.  Bank of Ireland has announced a new partnership with An Post to provide a range of banking services.</p>  <p>  There are a wide range of models in the delivery of financial services in the State.  These are being augmented all of the time, particularly in the area of online and phone app banking services. Complementing these wide range of models, we have huge diversity in the ownership of firms delivering retail services.

However, the reality of COVID-19 is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible and has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, subsidy payments of over &euro;2.4 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;408m granted to over 48,100 employers in respect of over 542,000 employees.</p>  <p>  Over the past 5 full months while level 5 restrictions have been in place, the average cost has been &euro;380m per month in direct subsidy and &euro;60m per month in PRSI foregone.  The scheme is demand led and the cost ultimately depends on a number of factors, including the numbers of employers making a valid claim for the subsidy and the numbers of employees they claim the subsidy in respect of. The cost would also depend on the criteria that was applied for the scheme, such as the employer and employee eligibility, the actual rates of subsidy being given, and the extent of public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  I have always been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 23 February, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time. </p></reply>

Details of the CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: .</p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing its business premises.</p><p>To make a claim under the CRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made.</p><p>I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to supports and the Deputy will be aware that both the EWSS and the CRSS are now to be extended until the end of June 2021.</p><p>With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.

The tax liabilities that may be deferred or &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; are VAT, PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments due to be refunded to Revenue by employers, and certain self-assessed income tax liabilities.  </p>  <p>  To be eligible for income tax warehousing, taxpayers have to declare that they estimated their total income for 2020 would be at least 25% less than their total income for 2019 and where applicable, that their total income for 2021 will be at least 25% less than their total income for 2019.</p>  <p>  In the case of VAT, PAYE (Employer) and excess TWSS liabilities, Period 1 refers to the period when a business has been unable to trade due to the Covid-19 related restrictions and includes the first full two monthly VAT period after the business resumes trading.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that where a business re-opened but has had to close again due to the re-imposition of restrictions, the trade is deemed to be still subject to the restrictions provided for in the regulations under sections 5 and 31A Health Act 1947 until it has re-opened again.  This means that VAT, PAYE (Employer) and excess TWSS liabilities for such businesses can continue to be warehoused in respect of the extended restricted period.  </p>  <p>  The end date for Period 1, and consequently the period for which liabilities can be warehoused, will vary from business to business depending on the restrictions affecting that business.  However, in all cases, Period 1 will include the duration for which a business is subject to trading restrictions plus the first full VAT period after the restrictions have been lifted and the business resumes trading.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible for Revenue to forecast the future cost of this scheme due to the uncertainty surrounding future restrictions.  </p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p><p>Borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. The BPFI reported, that as of 31 December 2020, approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% were receiving other supports from lenders.</p><p>As Minister for Finance I have no function in the commercial decisions made by banks, as such there are no direct cost implications for the State arising from universal payment brakes. The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation. The priority of the State is to ensure that SMEs and the wider business community has sufficient liquidity and cash flow supports through the continuance of the EWSS, CRSS and tax warehousing as well as the range of grants and loans schemes introduced by Government to help support businesses and jobs.</p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review  was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

In this regard it is the clear expectation of both the Government and the Central Bank that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers &ndash; in line with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code &ndash; to deliver appropriate and sustainable payment arrangements to borrowers who are affected by COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  In this regard I note that the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) has stated that its members are continuing to commit significant resources to support customers impacted by COVID-19, and in particular those who are affected by the latest restrictions. Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19.  The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.  In this context the Central Bank has made it clear that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers at this time, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also stated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to borrowers upon assessment.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

Ireland played a leading role in securing support for the Reserve at the European Council meeting last July.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Reserve is to help counter the adverse economic and social consequences of Brexit in the sectors and Member States that are worst affected. It will provide support:</p>  <p> -  to economic sectors, businesses and local communities, including those dependent on fishing activities in UK waters;</p>  <p> -  to employment, including through short-time work schemes, re-skilling and training;</p>  <p> -  to ensure the functioning of the required checks and controls as well as communication, information and awareness raising for citizens and businesses.</p>  <p>  It is generally acknowledged that Ireland is the Member State most impacted by Brexit and so we expect to be a significant beneficiary of the Reserve.  Ireland has already expended a considerable amount on preparing for Brexit, with successive budgets since 2016 providing significant supports for business and the agri-food sectors, as well as the infrastructure required at the port and airport to maintain the flow of east west trade.</p>  <p>  Discussions on the Reserve are continuing in the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  Ireland&rsquo;s view is that the Commission&rsquo;s proposed allocations are relevant, appropriate and fair and that they are in line with the solidarity envisaged by the European Council.  The proposed allocation for Ireland reflects the unique, adverse and disproportionate impact of Brexit on our economy. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains actively engaged in the ongoing discussions at political and senior official level and hopes that agreement on this proposal can be concluded quickly, so that funding can start to flow.</p></reply>

My Department is also responsible for maintaining the national frameworks within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for and value for money in public expenditure such as the Public Spending Code. The Public Spending Code sets the value for money requirements and guidance for evaluating, planning and managing capital projects. Management and delivery of investment projects and public services within allocation and the national frameworks is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister as indeed will be meeting the ambitious climate targets envisaged in the Programme for Government and Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill.</p>  <p>  The role of public investment in delivering on Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets is being assessed as part of the ongoing review of the National Development Plan. Climate was an important consideration in the development of the current National Development Plan and is also in the ongoing appraisal of projects and programmes.  However, in recognition of the need for systemic change, there will be an overarching focus on climate action throughout the new National Development Plan. It is intended that Departments will be required to assess their spending proposals/allocations against a range of environmental outcomes to ensure that their investment priorities are aligned with Ireland&rsquo;s climate and environmental objectives. To complement this sectoral assessment of the National Development Plan, my Department is proposing that the whole of the National Development Plan is assessed against a suitable climate/environmental methodology which is line with international good practices.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the National Development Plan is not a vehicle through which investment proposals are approved. All project and programme proposals included in the Plan are subject to the detailed rigour of the Public Spending Code. The Public Spending Code is not static. It is updated regularly to reflect lessons learned and international good practice. My Department has an ongoing body of work to strengthen the Public Spending Code requirements and guidance to support public bodies in their evaluation, planning and management of capital projects. This includes strengthening the consideration of environmental and climate factors in project appraisal, planning and delivery. In particular, I anticipate altering the shadow cost of carbon that applies to all projects once the higher targets envisaged in the draft Climate Action Bill are adopted. This will ensure that the amount of emissions a project may give rise to is quantified and a value placed on those emissions that reflects the cost that society will have to bear to eliminate these emissions in the future. This in turn allows the appraisal to determine if this future burden outweighs any benefits the project may bring. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.1034.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100090#WRT02100"><p>Equality Budgeting is a way of approaching and understanding the budget as a process that embodies long-standing societal choices about how resources are used, rather than simply a neutral process of resource allocation. In practice, this means that equality budgeting attempts to provide greater information on how proposed or ongoing budgetary decisions impact on particular groups in society, thereby integrating equality concerns into the budgetary process. Providing greater information on the likely impacts of budgetary measures facilitates the integration of equality concerns into the budgetary process, helping to avoid unintended adverse outcomes and enhancing the Government&rsquo;s decision making framework.</p>  <p>  A pilot programme was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. A number of diverse policy areas were selected, with associated objectives and indicators published in the 2018 Revised Estimates Volume (REV). A progress update was provided in the Public Service Performance Report 2018 (published in May 2019). Due to relatively good availability of gender-disaggregated data, the initial focus of Equality Budgeting was on gender. In subsequent budgetary cycles, the pilot initiative was extended to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality; twelve departments are now reporting Equality Budgeting metrics. An Expert Advisory Group was established to guide the development of Equality Budgeting policy. This group includes members from both within and outside of Government, and has met regularly since September 2018.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the OECD completed a Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland, and published their report alongside Budget 2020. The scan provides 12 recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward; implementation is currently underway, guided by an ambitious work plan. In line with the OECD recommendation to develop an equalities data strategy, the CSO conducted a data audit, in cooperation with DPER, to ascertain the availability of public service data that is disaggregated by equality dimension. This work was guided by the Expert Advisory Group and the audit findings were published alongside Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  Another recommendation of the OECD was the development of tagging and tracking functionality for departmental expenditure. In 2020, a project commenced to create a new architecture for Performance Budgeting, including Equality-, Green-, Well-being- and SDG-budgeting; this project is funded under the EU Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP). One key element of the project is to learn from best international practice to develop tagging and tracking of expenditure. DPER officials recently completed a two-day study visit (online) through the EU&rsquo;s TAIEX programme to learn about the approach of the French government to tagging and tracking expenditure. The valuable insights gained will contribute to the development of this functionality in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary cycle.</p>  <p>On March 9th 2021, the Government agreed several important points on progressing Equality Budgeting. A key point was the Government agreement to establish an inter-departmental group for Equality Budgeting, to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Government departments. The first meeting of this group is due to take place in the near future. This group, along with the existing Expert Advisory Group, will play a key role in guiding the continued implementation of the OECD recommendations for progressing Equality Budgeting. </p>  <p>  The memo also highlighted the relevance of the equality budgeting agenda for the Programme for Government commitment regarding the introduction of a well-being framework. The introduction of this type of framework was also a key recommendation of the OECD Scan. The integration of a well-being perspective into the budgetary cycle will build upon progress to date on performance budgeting and will integrate and support the equality budgeting agenda.</p></reply>

Section 1.1 of this document, which is based on public health advice and the Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021, provides guidance for employers in relation to who should attend the work premise during the pandemic.</p><p>The <i>COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead </i>plan was published by the Government on 23 February 2021. Within the plan there is a Framework for Restrictive Measures with five levels. Below is the work-related information for each of the levels. It should be noted that the employer will determine the essential roles which need to attend the workplace throughout the levels, taking into account the differing requirements at each level of the Framework for Restrictive Measures (see outline of levels below). Regard should be had to any changes to work premises attendance that may be required at each level of the Framework and workplace attendance plans and requirements should be communicated with employees.</p><p>The provision of services to society continues to be a priority for the public service during COVID-19. In addition, the Resilience and Recovery Plan identifies many public services as being essential during this time. Employers need to enable employees to be as productive as possible at all times, both in the work premises and in a blended and distributed workplace. Employers need to continue to be innovative in terms of new ways of working including maximising and fully exploring distributed and hybrid work models, where applicable. Employees have a role to play by cooperating with employers and in being proactive in identifying how they can increase value and how their roles can be performed effectively in the new and changing environment. During COVID-19, in order to ensure maximum efficiency, employees may be assigned work outside their usual core duties/given a new role.</p><p>The Framework provides for home working to continue where possible. Home working will continue as and when deemed appropriate by the employer, having regard to the changes that may be required at each level of the Framework. Home working must be balanced with the requirement to continue to provide the most effective and efficient services to the public, in line with the provisions of the framework.</p><p><b>- Level 1:</b>Work from home if possible. Attend work for specific business requirements and on a staggered attendance basis. </p><p><b>- Level 2:</b>Work from home if possible. Attendance at work for essential on-site meetings, inductions and training.</p><p><b>- Level 3:</b>Work from home unless absolutely necessary to attend in person.</p><p><b>- Level 4:</b>Only essential or other designated workers should go to work.</p><p><b>- Level 5:</b>Work from home unless it is for work which is in essential health, social care or other essential service and cannot be done from home.</p><p>Employers must ensure that all work premises have implemented robust pre-return to workplace procedures, where not already in place, and that all procedures comply with the Work Safely Protocol. These procedures should be clearly communicated to employees. The Protocol, which is a revision of the previous Return to Work Safely Protocol, was published on 20 November and incorporates current public health advice. It outlines the measures needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to facilitate the re-opening of workplaces following temporary closures.</p><p>Employers should ensure that they have properly implemented the advice in the Protocol and ensure that it is tailored, where necessary, to meet the unique set of circumstances pertaining to each sector and workplace location.</p><p>Some employers have continued to have employees in their work premises during the restrictions. Employers should ensure that the new Protocol is reviewed in respect of all employees i.e. employees required to return to the work premises and those employees who have continued to work on site. There may be additional issues to consider to ensure compliance with the Protocol for those employees who are already working onsite. </p><p>All employees have a critical role in ensuring that the procedures of the Protocol are followed to suppress COVID-19 in their workplace. It is incumbent on all employees who are required to attend the workplace to fully comply with their organisation&rsquo;s COVID response plan. Cooperation between employees, the lead worker representative(s) and the employer are fundamental to ensuring that the measures are adhered to.</p></reply>

The Department is currently in the process of completing a survey issued by the National Disability Authority on the operation of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 and will follow up on any actions arising from this.</p><p>I am advised of the following with regard to the bodies under the aegis of my Department:</p><p><b>Office of Public Works</b></p><p>The steps taken by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in this regard include:</p><p>- Provision of interpretation to persons seeking to avail of, or access, services through Irish Sign Language (ISL);</p><p>- Provision of ISL tours at Heritage sites upon request. OPW also run a programme of scheduled ISL tours throughout the year on certain sites.  In addition, the interpretation service upload an ISL video promoting the tour on the ISL vlogs and films Facebook page, where possible;</p><p>- ISL interpreters engaged by the OPW are accredited in accordance with the accreditation scheme funded by the Minister for Social Protection; and</p><p>- Training provided to OPW staff including Deaf Awareness Training and National Disability Authority (NDA) disability awareness training.  Specific training on communicating with persons who are deaf or hard of hearing and or persons whose first language is ISL along with funding for employees to attend ISL classes.</p><p><b>Public Appointments Service</b></p><p>The Public Appointments Service (PAS) has provided Irish Sign Language users with free interpretation when availing of PAS services (i.e. attending for assessments, including interviews, where required) prior to the enactment of this legislation.PAS recently launched its ED&amp;amp;I Strategy and used a web-based translation service for all contributions. A full-time Disability Champion is on staff who service users (mainly prospective candidates) can contact to receive information about the supports PAS has in place to ensure that services are accessible to all.  PAS staff are provided with Disability Awareness Training, including training provided by the NDA and Rehab.  PAS is currently developing its own Disability Awareness Training for selection board members and staff.</p><p><b>National Shared Services Office</b></p><p>The National Shared Services Office (NSSO) is currently studying its obligations under the Act and considering the required next steps.  The NSSO only provides services to Civil and Public Servants rather than the general public.  All of its services can be accessed via email or webpages, and there have no requests to date for Irish Sign Language interpretation.</p><p><b>Office of the Ombudsman</b></p><p>As it currently stands, the Office of the Ombudsman has one staff member certified at Irish Sign Language QQI Award Level 4.  Certification at this level provides a degree of fluency and an ability to engage in conversation with Irish Sign Language signers.  A second staff member has also recently been identified for training in Irish Sign Language.  They are currently enrolled in Irish Sign Language QQI Award Level 3.  It is envisaged that, over time, these staff members will act as the first point of contact for any service users who look to engage through Irish Sign Language.  A review is also underway of the Office&rsquo;s need to engage external Irish Sign Language services than can be employed quickly when required. </p><p>Once this is complete, an Irish Sign Language Policy will be drafted.  This will outline the obligations under the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, the services available to customers and how they can avail of these.  Once finalised, this will be published on each of the Office's websites.  Relevant training on the policy will also be provided to any staff in a customer facing role.  </p><p><b>Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery</b></p><p>The Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery (ORNL) does not provide any &ldquo;statutory entitlements or services&rdquo; as set out in Section 6(1) of the Act.  Therefore, the public body duties under the Irish Sign Language Act do not apply to the ORNL.</p><p><b>State Laboratory</b></p><p>The State Laboratory provides a comprehensive analytical chemistry and advisory service to Government Departments and Offices.  Therefore, the public body duties under the Irish Sign Language Act do not apply to the State Laboratory.</p></reply>

The Government's response to the impact of the pandemic on the sector and the economy generally is comprised of a broad range of supports delivered across a range of Departments.  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme  and the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme form the principle elements of the Government's response.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently announced the Small Business Assistance Scheme for Covid (SBASC) as a further horizontal support across all sectors of the economy.  SMEs and businesses in the non-funded live events sector are eligible to apply under this scheme.</p><p>I was pleased to recently announce a new &euro;50 million suite of additional measures to further support those in the Live Entertainment Sector. As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;25 million is being made available under the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021.  This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences.  </p><p>The 2021 scheme is aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and is being managed directly by my Department. </p><p>An allocation of &euro;5 million will be made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events.  Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances.  </p><p>As a further support measure for those in the live entertainment industry, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for a new scheme to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:</p><p>- &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p><p>- &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000. </p><p>Under the scheme, musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers -  whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply. The scheme will open when the necessary administrative and IT systems are in place.</p><p>&euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector. This will be applied to supporting the installation of high quality recording and streaming facilities in venues through a competitive grant application process. </p><p>Further information on the business and financial supports my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has in place to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis can be viewed at the following link </p></reply>

A further round of that scheme is a matter for my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  More broadly in regard to future supports, the Government has committed to publishing a National Economic Recovery Plan which will consider more targeted measures to help re-boot those sectors, such as tourism, who will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens.</p>  <p>  I have also received the first Report from the Recovery Oversight Group (ROG) on 15th February.  The Group, which has been tasked with overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Tourism Recovery Plan, has identified a number of areas that require particular attention in the context of the survival and recovery of the tourism sector in Ireland.  The recommendations from the first Report include proposals, many of which will benefit the B&amp;B sector, relating to maintenance of the CRSS and EWSS; clear criteria around reopening; extension of the Local Authority Rates Waiver; extending the period for the 9% VAT rate; progressing insurance reform; and revising the Stay and Spend Scheme. A number of these supports, namely the CRSS, EWSS, and Rates waiver, have since been extended to end June 2021). </p>  <p>  I have written to Ministers Varadkar, Donohoe and O&rsquo;Brien and asked them to consider the Report and also brought the Report to Cabinet for information.  I will keep the ROG report under consideration in the context of National Economic Recovery Plan and the development of additional supports.  </p></reply>

The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a universal basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors. The Taskforce was of the view that a pilot UBI would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national.</p><p>I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society; it includes a broad mix of employment types and it has been chosen for similar pilots in other jurisdictions.</p><p>Any action on a pilot basic income scheme will not come solely from my Department.  Like many financial supports before and during the pandemic, a wider cohort in government must assess the strengths and weaknesses of any such scheme and decision on how it is funded.</p><p>I understand that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has requested the Low Pay Commission to examine the commitment in the Programme for Government and the Commission has agreed that this request will form part of its workplan for 2021.  The terms of reference for the study on Universal Basic Income are currently being finalised by the Commission and research is due to begin shortly.</p></reply>

The Strategy and supporting action plan have cross-departmental ownership and, accordingly, responsibility for implementation falls on a number of Government Departments, bodies and Irish language and Gaeltacht organisations. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media is responsible for coordinating its implementation.</p><p>The Action Plan and the inaugural annual progress report published in October 2020 present a clear overview of the 180 or so actions being advanced by c. 60 stakeholders in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions.  </p><p>Undoubtedly, functioning in the shadow of the pandemic over the last year has proved challenging  and this is no less the case in terms of delivery of supports in the domains of Irish language and Gaeltacht affairs.  </p><p>Nonetheless, significant progress is being made and the forthcoming publication of the second progress report - covering the period from July 2019 to December 2020 - following Government approval, will set out in detail the advances that have been made over the period, notwithstanding the current challenges arising from the pandemic.</p><p>I might also point out that an additional  exchequer allocation of &euro;14.8m was included in Budget 2021 for the Irish language and Gaeltacht sectors, further enabling support for the language and Gaeltacht regions  - particulartly in the context of the ongoing implementation of the language planning process and the the Policy on Gaeltacht Education being spearheaded by the Department of Education.  </p><p>This additional allocation ultimately means that total funding in excess of &euro;78m is being deployed in support of the Irish language via my Department alone this year. </p><p>In 2021, a budget allocation of &euro;5m has been made by my Department to support the Language Planning Process.  This will enable my Department to fund both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge who are tasked under the Gaeltacht Act, 2012 with supporting the language planning process.  It will also enable my Department to support, at a central level, organisations which operate in the Early Years and Childhood, Family and Traditional Arts sectors as an additional support to the language planning process.  </p><p>To date, my Department has approved 20 Language Plans in respect of Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, 3 Irish Language Networks and 2 Gaeltacht Service Towns.  There are currently 22 Language Planning Officers (including 4 assistant officers) employed in 18 Language Planning Areas across the Gaeltacht. Since the onset of Covid-19 restrictions, these Language Planning Officers (LPOs) have been working to provide new and innovative opportunities for their communities to connect and use Irish together.</p><p>The roll-out of these new initiatives began as early as April of last year, with a series of free online &lsquo;Z&uacute;mlanna&rsquo; or workshops covering a range of different interests from a six-week creative writing course to online &lsquo;o&iacute;cheanta airne&aacute;in&rsquo; (traditional social evenings with music, song and dance) to a series of fashion and style workshops. At the same time, the LPOs were also launching #Seo&Iacute;AnGhaeltacht, a social media campaign aimed at creating a virtual space for different Gaeltacht communities to connect with each other and share what the Gaeltacht means to them. This campaign is ongoing and was nominated for a communications and media award at Oireachtas na Samhna.</p><p>Since the roll-out of these early initiatives, LPOs in all 18 Gaeltacht areas have been working on providing their communities with opportunities to use and/or improve their Irish with projects such as:</p><p>- An Caif&eacute; Cult&uacute;ir &ndash; a monthly online &lsquo;Culture Caf&eacute;&rsquo; hosted by LPOs from the Galway Gaeltacht;</p><p>- Online Irish Language Classes and Ciorcail Chomhr&aacute;;</p><p>- Com&oacute;rtas Reatha na Gaeltachta &ndash; a virtual fitness challenge where walking/running groups in different Gaeltacht areas measured their collective mileage over a month to compete for the title of the &lsquo;Fittest Gaeltacht Area&rsquo;. During this event, which took place for the first time in spring 2020 and will be running again from 5<sup>th</sup>April 2020, participants were able to connect via a WhatsApp group for their &lsquo;team&rsquo; (all of which was through Irish). This initiative also encouraged connections between different Gaeltacht areas;</p><p>- Marat&oacute;n na bP&aacute;ist&iacute; &ndash; an initiative run in conjunction with MarathonKids where pupils in participant primary schools ran a marathon (42.2km) over a number of weeks. Thanks to the LPOs, participant schools in the Gaeltacht received Irish language teaching materials on the physical and mental benefits of running and students were presented with bespoke t-shirts and medals;</p><p>- An Mh&iacute; faoi Bhl&aacute;th and An Ghaeltacht faoi Bhl&aacute;th &ndash; the &lsquo;An Mh&iacute; Faoi Bhl&aacute;th&rsquo; project was run in the R&aacute;th Chairn and Baile Ghib Gaeltacht in early spring 2021: individuals and families in the Meath Gaeltacht were provided with packets of seeds and information through Irish on the names of different flowers and how and where to plant them. This project inspired An Ghaeltacht faoi Bhl&aacute;th, a series of online seminars on gardening, nature and ecology with different guest speakers from various Gaeltacht areas. The seminars are free to the public and encourage open discussion and participation.</p><p>Due to the ongoing COVID situation, many of the organisations and activities funded under my Department&rsquo;s Irish Language Support Schemes have had to move online.  My Department has ensured that they have received support, in financial terms and otherwise, in adapting their workplans, as needed, to ensure that they continue to serve the Irish language community.</p><p>Amongst the various initiatives my Department has supported are:</p><p><b>- Gaillimh le Gaeilge &lsquo;L&iacute;onra ar l&iacute;ne&rsquo;</b>&ndash; Irish language online networking events for the business community in Galway City</p><p><b>- Cl&aacute;r Techspace</b>&ndash; Training and activities provided online for students and teachers in STEAM subjects<i>as Gaeilge</i></p><p><b>- TechF&eacute;ile </b>&ndash; This years TechF&eacute;ile was run as a programme of events online rather than a one-day event.  The programme of events, which ran over eight weeks, culminated last week  in a live virtual awards ceremony celebrating all projects. Over the course of the eight weeks, there were weekly online sessions with the TechSpace team, to make sure that each group had all of the support they need to learn and grow in their chosen area. </p><p><b>- An Cumann Scoildr&aacute;ma&iacute;ochta</b>&ndash; My Department is supporting An Cumann Scoildr&aacute;ma&iacute;ochta and schools around the country to record entries for this year&rsquo;s F&eacute;ile Scoildr&aacute;ma&iacute;ochta</p><p><b>- Gluaiseacht (Conradh na Gaeilge) </b>&ndash; The roadshow supported by my Department moved all of their activities online last year, ensuring schoolchildren and third level students still had the opportunity to participate in a wide range of activities and workshops as Gaeilge and to connect with Irish speakers across the country</p><p><b>- Teaching of Irish overseas</b>&ndash; My Department has continued to support the teaching of Irish overseas with online classes being delivered via our partners such as the Fulbright Commission and the Ireland Canada University Foundation</p><p>Foras na Gaeilge, its Lead Organisations and organisations/groups throughout the country have also worked to support the Irish language community. </p><p>While there were few opportunities to physically meet over the past year, there has been a huge upswing in the opportunities available online and on social media.

The waiver applies to businesses most seriously affected by ongoing restrictions, with automatic eligibility extending to retail, hospitality, including hotels, pubs and restaurants, leisure and entertainment, personal services such as hairdressers and barbers, health services and various other categories.</p>  <p>  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. Local authorities levy rates on property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. Valuation lists contain broad categories of commercial property and there is no distinct category for the tourism sector. Accordingly, the figures quoted in this reply are estimates only.</p>  <p>  The estimated cost of extending the local authority rates waiver for tourism and hospitality is approximately &euro;52.9 million per quarter, &euro;44.2m from hospitality, and &euro;8.7m from leisure and entertainment respectively. The estimated cost to extend the rates waiver for these categories from 1 July until the end of 2021 is approximately &euro;105.8m million and to extend until the end of March 2022 is approximately &euro;158.7m million.</p></reply>

The drafting of the Bill is progressing well.</p>  <p>  The Serviced Sites Fund supports affordable homes delivered by local authorities, funding infrastructure on local authority lands to enable the delivery of affordable homes to purchase or rent. Funding of almost &euro;188 million has been approved in principle in support of 38 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 4,000 more affordable homes. In addition to these projects, approval in principle has also been given to three further applications for SSF funding, namely, Dublin City Council's projects in Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council's project in Shanganagh. Affordable homes provided by local authorities via the SSF will come with an initial purchase price of between 10% and 40% below market prices, bringing many within the reach of single purchasers.</p>  <p>  Another element of the Bill, the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme, is designed to help bridge the gap, by means of an equity stake, between the mortgage people have and the price of the new home they wish to buy. This affordability measure will enable First Time Buyers, including single people,  to bridge the affordability gap, allowing them to buy a new home.</p>  <p>  As well as the affordability measures in the Bill, the Land Development Agency is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. The LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation, on the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land, as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes. The LDA will deliver affordable homes which will be available to single buyers.</p>  <p>  Additional affordability measures, such as the Help to buy scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are already available to eligible applicants.</p>  <p>  The Help to Buy Scheme has had 23,545 approvals by the end of February 2021, with the estimated total value of approved Help to Buy claims to date in the order of &euro;389.2 million.</p>  <p>  At the end of February 2021, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan has had 3,817 approvals. Budget 2021 confirmed that &euro;210 million has been sanctioned for RIHL lending in 2021.</p></reply>

Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS tenants are considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing.</p>  <p>  However, recognising that tenants housed through RAS prior to this change might have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued in 2011 which recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for pre-2011 RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. This arrangement effectively allowed these households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list.</p>  <p>  I have no statutory function in the decision making or processing of transfer applications in local authority dwellings. The oversight and management of housing waiting lists, including the allocation and transfer of tenancies, is a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, and associated regulations. Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 requires that all local authorities, as a reserved function, make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p>  <p>  In making their allocation schemes, authorities are required to specify, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households on the waiting list and households who have been approved for transfers. Local authorities assess housing applicants taking into account factors such as the condition and affordability of existing accommodation, medical and compassionate grounds, etc. The authorities then prioritise the needs of approved applicants.</p>  <p>  Where a vacant property arises, it is a matter for individual housing authorities, in accordance with their allocation schemes, to determine whether the allocation is made to a household on the main waiting list, or to a transfer applicant, such as a household from RAS, and the method of such allocation. It is open to housing authorities to specify in their allocation schemes the proportion of allocations which will be reserved for transfers, and within this, how many may be reserved for households seeking transfers to other forms of social housing support.</p>  <p>  If a tenant has applied for a transfer from RAS to another form of social housing and is not satisfied with the decision they receive, they can make a formal appeal in writing to the office manager of the RAS section. The tenant can then further appeal the decision to the Director of Services in the Local Authority and, if the tenant considers they have been unfairly treated or are not satisfied with the decision at that stage of the appeal, they could contact the Office of the Ombudsman. By law the Ombudsman can investigate complaints about any of the Local Authorities administrative actions or procedures. The Office of the Ombudsman provides a free, impartial and independent dispute resolution service and can be contacted at 6 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2 or through the website at www.ombudsman.ie.</p></reply>

Under RAS, local authorities draw up contracts with landlords to provide housing, for an agreed term, to people with a long-term housing need. The local authority pays the rent directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant. The main "landlord and tenant" relationship remains between the property owner and the RAS tenant. The property is not rented to the Local Authority, it is rented to the RAS tenant on a contractual basis. The local authority acts as agent on behalf of the tenant.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancy Act 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. The RTB dispute resolution service replaces the courts in relation to the majority of landlord and tenant disputes.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 govern the relationship between the landlord and the tenant. Under the terms of these Acts, a RAS tenancy must be registered with the RTB. If the tenancy is not registered, the landlord cannot avail of the dispute resolution services of the RTB should an issue arise with the tenancy. However, this does not affect the tenant&rsquo;s right to avail of the services of the RTB. As a housing authority is neither a landlord nor a tenant under a RAS agreement, it does not have a role in the tenancy under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) and therefore cannot refer or be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board.</p>  <p>  RAS landlords and tenants have the same right to refer disputes to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) as other private rented tenancies. The range of complaints which may be referred to the RTB is very broad, covering everything from disputed notices of termination to property damage. Third parties, such as neighbours, can also refer a dispute with the landlord to the RTB if they have been directly affected by the landlord&rsquo;s failure to deal with anti-social behaviour by the tenant. Information on the rights of tenants and landlords is available from the RTB website.</p></reply>

The works required can range from the lower intervention external wall replacement to full demolition and rebuild, and the preparation for and completion of such works can take considerable time.

Any consideration of an extension to scheme to other counties would, in the first instance, require the relevant local authority to carry out a rigorous analysis of the issues locally. Such analysis would need to demonstrate that identified issues are due to the presence of excessive amounts of deleterious materials (mica or pyrite) in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks.

However, in advance of deciding to make an order under section 23 of the Act, the Minister must, in accordance with section 32(2) of the Local Government Act 1991, request a boundary committee to make a report having regard to such matters as may be specified by the Minister. The publication of Census of Population data is one of a number of factors that informs the preparation of terms of reference for any review of local electoral areas to be undertaken and provides a basis for the work of any Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee(s) which may be established by the Minister from time to time. The Minister must publish the report of the boundary committee and must have regard to the report of that committee when deciding to make an order in relation to the revision of local electoral area boundaries.</p><p>On 15 December 2020, the Government approved the drafting of an Electoral Reform Bill and the circulation of the Bill's general scheme to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for pre-legislative consideration. The general scheme addresses a number of commitments in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future including the establishment of an independent statutory Electoral Commission. The general scheme was circulated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on 8 January 2021 and has been published on my Department's website at .</p><p>The proposals in the general scheme provide that, following its establishment, the Commission will take on several existing statutory electoral functions from the outset, including the work currently undertaken by Local Electoral Area Boundary Committees.

The extension of the transitional period originally prescribed by Section 38(b) of the 2009 Act (3 years) by the aforementioned 2011 Act (extending the period to 12 years) relates simply to the period when a claim to a prescriptive right can be made by reliance on the 'old' law replaced by the 2009 Act. From 2021, reliance must be made on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act; in particular, reliance must be made on the new single and shorter period of 12 years. There is no question of a cut-off point occurring in 2021 when a claim to a prescriptive right can no longer be made. All that changes in 2021 is the basis on which the prescriptive right can be claimed.<br /><br />2. The new procedure for registration of a prescriptive right introduced by Section 41 of the 2011 Act is not subject to a time limit.  It is a permanent procedure and, in particular, does not cease to be available in 2021. The only change which occurs in 2021 is the basis on which an application must be made to the PRA. As pointed out in (1) above, from 2021, the application will have to be grounded on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act and reliance on the 'old' law repealed by that Act will cease to be possible. </blockquote>  <p>This procedure is only for easements (including rights of way) acquired by prescription. If all parties agree to the registration of an easement, an application should be made by lodging the appropriate Deed of Grant.</p><p>Finally, a Practice Direction Easements and Profits &agrave; Prendre Acquired by Prescription under Section 49A is available on the PRA&rsquo;s website (www.prai.ie) that covers the process relating to the registration of prescriptive easements.</p></reply>

In this regard the Government has recently published a Policy Paper, entitled Irish Water - Towards a national, publicly-owned, regulated water services utility, setting out the expectations and views of Government on the next phase of transformation. The Government expectation is that water services activities will be fully integrated into and delivered by Irish Water and that an appropriate operational framework will facilitate this integrated service delivery model. The Policy Paper is available on my Department's website at <i></i>. </p><p>The Paper restates the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to public ownership of public water services. The principle of public ownership of the public water system is currently reflected in the Water Services Acts and the Paper states that the Government sees no circumstances arising where any part of Irish Water would be placed in private ownership. There is broad agreement amongst the Irish people and across the political spectrum that public water services should be publicly owned and controlled. It is intended that the forthcoming legislation to facilitate the separation of Irish Water from the Ervia Group will further strengthen the imperative of public ownership of Irish Water.</p><p>There must also be recognition that not all water services are provided by Irish Water. The Government's policy and stated commitment therefore is to maintain public water services in public ownership, whilst respecting private arrangements for the provision of water services by group water schemes and by individual households, businesses and other bodies.</p><p>The Policy Paper commits to engagement on the referendum issue, noting that such engagement must take place within the context of the wider societal engagement, and in which the relevant Oireachtas Committee will have a key role to play.</p></reply>

The primary benefit of bringing vacant buildings back in to use is the increased supply of quality and sustainable housing for the individuals and families. Revitalising our main streets through well designed refurbishment of residential units, particularly above shops, could help to rejuvenate rural areas, smaller town centres and city streets as well as producing more homes.</p><p>While there are a range of grants available to meet specific housing adaptation needs, or indeed for the thatching of properties, which could support the restoration of properties in rural areas, the most specific supports available to assist owners to bring vacant housing stock back into use, are:</p><p>- The Repair and Leasing Scheme is available to assist private property owners, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. If eligible for the scheme, the property owner can avail of a loan of up to &euro;60,000 from the local authority to carry out the refurbishment of property.</p><p>- The Buy and Renew initiative particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community with the added value of delivery social housing units.  It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased.</p><p>The Bringing Back Homes manual published by my Department is aimed at property owners, members of the public, local authorities and stakeholders in the construction industry who are interested in developing vacant buildings. It provides clear and detailed guidance on current policy and regulatory requirements that apply to this form of development.  The Bringing Back Homes manual is available to download at: <i></i></p><p>The manual also supports the work of the vacant homes offices in local authorities, which create a central point of contact for those interested in developing existing buildings. These offices are a useful resource to assist developers and owners in clarifying the regulatory requirements that exist and how they apply to development, thus reducing uncertainty and complexity but maintaining safe, sustainable and quality standards for homes.</p><p>My Department is working closely with Local Authorities to encourage property owners to avail of the Buy and Renew Scheme and the Repair and Lease Scheme to combat vacancy and dereliction and to accelerate, where possible, bringing units back into use for residential purposes.  This focus on greater use of these schemes also aligns with the ambition under Action 58 of Our Rural Future &ndash; Rural Development Plan 2021 to 2025.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the services and the funding required to address homelessness in each region. Following that determination the procurement of individual services and associated contractual arrangements entered into are a  matter for individual housing authorities.  In contracting services housing authorities are obliged to ensure compliance with all relevant statutory obligations in respect of provision of services and use of public funds.</p></reply>

In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally.  </p>  <p>  A new fire station at Dunleer is provided for in this Capital Programme.

In multi-unit developments, the &quot;person having control&quot; is generally the owner management company.</p><p>Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which is under the remit of the Minister for Justice, the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.</p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements have arisen, the Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published in 2017. It is intended to be used as a guide for the owners and occupants of dwellings (houses and apartments) where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern, to develop strategies to improve fire safety and to develop strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available at the following link: <i></i></p><p>In addition, a Draft Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings has been developed by my Department and is available for public consultation at: <i> </i></p><p>This draft code of practice has been developed as a result of the recommendations contained in Fire Safety in Ireland (2018) &ndash; the report of the Fire Safety Task Force, which was established in my Department following the tragic Grenfell Tower fire in London in 2017. It is proposed that the code of practice be issued under section 18A of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003. </p><p>Finally, the Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of building defects and provides for an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing report, &quot;Safe as Houses&quot;.</p><p>In this regard, my Department has been actively engaging with key stakeholders and I have had several meetings with stakeholder representative groups on this matter.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p><p>While responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, the administration of homeless services is organised on a regional basis, with nine administrative regions in place.  A homelessness consultative forum has been established in each region in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009.  It is a matter for the management group of the consultative forum, in the first instance, to determine the homeless services required to address homelessness at a local level. </p><p>My Department does not fund any homeless accommodation or service directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards the overall costs incurred in the provision of homeless accommodation.  Furthermore, housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of the funding arrangements with my Department. Therefore, the amount of funding granted by housing authorities to individual homeless services is a matter for the relevant housing authority. </p><p>Certified financial reports from each of the homeless regions, setting out homeless services and expenditure on these services from 2017 to 2019 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>https//www.housing.gov.ie/housing/homelessness/other/homelessness-data</i>. </p><p>Financial reports for 2020 are currently being examined and will be published shortly.</p></reply>

A management plan scoping exercise was undertaken by ESB International on behalf of the ESB in 2016/2017. The NPWS took part in the stakeholder group that contributed to the report produced as a result of that exercise.</p>  <p>  Under the Habitats Directive, Ireland is obliged to report to the EU on the conservation status of all habitats and species of European Community interest, as listed in Annexes to the Directive. Monitoring of SACs are carried out by the NPWS on a cyclical basis, typically every three years. The most recent report was submitted to the EU in 2019 and is available on the NPWS website.</p>  <p>  The priority habitat &ldquo;Alluvial forests with Alder and Ash&rdquo; is one of the qualifying interests of the Gearagh SAC and a monitoring site for this habitat is located within the SAC. It was most recently surveyed during the 2017-2018 monitoring period, when the area, structure and functions, and future prospects of the habitat in SAC were all assessed as favourable. This is in contrast with the national conservation status of the Alluvial forests habitat in Ireland, which is considered to be bad, and deteriorating.</p>  <p>  The Gearagh SAC is also listed for the habitat &ldquo;Rivers with muddy banks&rdquo;. In addition to the NPWS survey, results of a 2018 botanical survey were made available to the NPWS by the ESB. The habitat was assessed as favourable in the Gearagh SAC.</p>  <p>  There is one invasive plant species (Tall Flatsedge) that requires monitoring at the Gearagh SAC, but there is no clear evidence that the species is negatively impacting on the habitat.</p>  <p>  The NPWS continue to engage with the ESB on the monitoring of this site. The positive findings from scientific surveys are indicators of a good management regime. </p></reply>

Under this procedure, a household may apply for support to one housing authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or the authority that agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  A household meeting either the residence or local connection condition may specify up to three areas of choice for receipt of support in the areas of all housing authorities in the county and city concerned and, if qualified, will be entered on the housing waiting list of each of those housing authorities. </p>  <p>  Consistent with the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households in receipt of a payment under the HAP scheme are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, local authorities were also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.</p>  <p>  Guidelines on inter-authority movement were issued to local authorities to facilitate the movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant wishes to access rented accommodation, with HAP support, in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the relevant Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority. </p>  <p>  In order to maintain equity between all tenants in receipt of social housing support, and avoid the potential for difficult to enforce movements in shared rental markets/across local authority borders, inter-authority movement for HAP will be facilitated without reference to Social Housing Eligibility Income Bands in areas that offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes, as no change to existing treatment is involved in such areas. For example, in Dublin, the four local authority areas currently offer shared areas of choice in their allocation schemes. However, HAP tenants who avail of inter-authority movement, can only be offered access to the transfer list of the originating local authority.</p>  <p>  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their own scheme of letting priorities. The making of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has a customer service charter and complaints procedure for applicants who may wish to make a complaint regarding the service they receive. Following that complaint, if they consider that they have been unfairly treated or are not satisfied with the Council&rsquo;s decision on their complaint, it is open to them to make a complaint to the Ombudsman. </p></reply>

For example: </p>  <p>  The Energy Efficiency Programme aims to improve energy performance and comfort levels in homes. Since 2014, 60,357 homes have benefited from some level of retrofitting works at a cost of &euro;134m</p>  <p>  The Voids Programme funds local authorities to remediate vacant homes to ensure they meet minimum letting standards. Since 2014, 16,102 vacant local authority homes have been remediated and re-let at a cost of &euro;229m</p>  <p>  The Disabled Persons Grant Scheme funds necessary adaptations to local authority housing stock to accommodate the needs of the elderly and disabled and to relieve overcrowding. Since 2014, thousands of households have had their living conditions improved at a cost of &euro;94m.   </p>  <p>  Moving forward, my Department is working with the local authority sector, through the City and County Management Association to transition the sector from a largely response based approach to housing stock maintenance to a strategic and informed planned maintenance approach based on stock condition surveys.  Planned maintenance works will commence in some local authorities in 2022. Budget 2021 saw a significant uplift in Energy Efficiency funding and the Programme for Government commits to further funding being made available to local authorities going forward for planned maintenance works; insulation, windows and doors and heating systems. </p></reply>

A legal requirement to quarantine in Ireland has also been introduced for all passengers arriving, except those whose journey originates in Northern Ireland. The requirements to complete the form, to provide appropriate evidence of testing and to quarantine apply to those travelling from Great Britain. These requirements also apply to persons who arrive via Northern Ireland and have been overseas in the 14 days prior to their arrival in Ireland.</p><p>Those travelling to Ireland who have been in a high risk Category 2 country, including those who have transited an airport in such a country, in the previous 14 days before they arrive must complete mandatory hotel quarantine.

Mandatory hotel quarantine is therefore not currently required for those travelling from Great Britain, who have not been in a Category 2 country in the 14 days prior to their arrival in Ireland.</p><p>The UK Government and the UK's devolved administrations have established testing and quarantine regulations for those travelling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, those whose journey begins in Ireland and who have remained in Ireland, or elsewhere in the Common Travel Area, for 10 days prior to travel, do not require a pre-travel PCR test to travel to any part of the UK. They are also not subject to mandatory quarantine rules once they have entered the UK, but remain subject to the local restrictions and travel advice in place.</p></reply>

As I have stated, the role of the military in society is to protect its citizens, not to murder and terrorise them. </p><p>I have called upon the Myanmar military to demonstrate restraint, respect the freedoms of expression, association, and assembly, to restore unimpeded access to telecommunications and to uphold human rights and the rule of law. I have also called for the immediate release of political detainees and for the reinstatement of the legitimate civilian Government.</p><p>In support of sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them, I endorsed the strong and comprehensive approach set out in the Council Conclusions adopted by the FAC on February 22, and the adoption of sanctions on March 22.</p><p>At the UN Security Council, Ireland set out its concerns in discussions on the situation in Myanmar on 2 February and 5 March. It is welcome that the Security Council took united positions following these meetings in the press statement of 4 February and presidential statement of 10 March. The unity in the international response sends a strong message to the Myanmar military.  The crisis remains on the agenda of the Security Council and our Mission to the UN continues to follow developments closely.</p><p>I emphasise the importance of a united response to this crisis, in particular, we need to recognise the importance of engaging partners in the region to ensure an effective, appropriate, and sustainable outcome to the crisis. Through the UN and our Embassy network, we are encouraging those who have influence on the military leadership, including countries within the region, to use it to protect the human rights of the Myanmar people.</p><p>The Embassy of Ireland in Bangkok, which is accredited to Myanmar, is closely monitoring the situation. The Embassy is liaising closely with EU Missions and other like-minded partners in Myanmar regarding the situation on the ground. We are currently advising Irish citizens in Myanmar to leave the country by commercial means as soon as possible. This is reflected in the Department&rsquo;s Travel Advice for Myanmar, which we are reviewing and updating on a regular basis. </p><p>Our Embassy in Bangkok is also maintaining regular communication with all registered Irish citizens in Myanmar to provide advice and information, including in relation to travel options. The Embassy continues to advise citizens regarding resident Embassies on the ground, which can provide consular assistance if and where required..</p></reply>

Our Webchat team have answered more than 30,000 queries.   The Passport Service has continued to make excellent progress with the Passport Reform Programme. This will deliver a modern passport processing system to replace the current software designed nearly 20 years ago.

Procurement takes place in compliance with Directive 2014/24/EU and supported by procurement guidelines published by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). Procurement rules require the Department to award contracts under procedures designed to achieve value for public money in an open, transparent, non-discriminatory and competitive manner. </p>  <p>  The Department, as a contracting authority, recognises that public procurement can be used to promote wider social considerations. The general position from a procurement perspective is that social criteria can be included in the procurement process provided that they are linked to the subject matter of the contract and are contract specific. The use of social clauses are most effectively utilised in large-scale works contracts as opposed to contracts for goods and services. The majority of the Department's procurement contracts are with small firms or individuals providing professional, consultancy and general services.  However, procurement contracts in the Department for general services and ICT managed services requires contractors, as employers, to be fully compliant with labour rules, collective agreements and the EU Employment Directives. Tenderers are excluded from competition if they fail to meet the required social criteria.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is not aware of any instances of litigation or the threat of litigation arising from the inclusion of social clauses in the Department&rsquo;s public procurement contracts in 2017, 2018, 2019 or 2020. </p></reply>

It enables the EU to stand up quickly and in a more tangible and direct way for human rights, one of the fundamental values of the EU and its foreign policy.</p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council on the 22nd of March, and in keeping with the political commitment to swiftly adopt the first listings under the EUGHRSR, 11 individuals and 4 entities from China, Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Libya, Eritrea, South Sudan and Russia were identified as targets for sanctions.  </p>  <p>  In relation to China, the EU has stated that it continues to be gravely concerned about the existence of a large network of political re-education camps, widespread surveillance, and systemic restrictions on freedom of religion or belief against Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the EU has targeted four Chinese persons and one entity with an assets freeze and travel ban under the terms of the EUGHRSR. The use of these sanctions is designed to act as a deterrent and encourage changes in these actors&rsquo; behaviour. They are based on solid legal evidence and are deployed in addition to other measures such as dialogue.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s approach is in contrast to the retaliatory approach taken by China, which is seen as an attempt to punish the EU and its Member States and is not an answer to the legitimate concern expressed by the EU on the human rights situation in Xinjiang. The arbitrary list of sanctions released by Beijing, which targets academics, parliamentarians and diplomats as well as their families, is in fact an attack on academic freedom and freedom of expression.</p>  <p>  In common with other Member States, Ireland has raised with China its concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang on a number of occasions, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora such as the UN Human Rights Council and UN Third Committee. In these interventions we have called on China to respect human rights and allow immediate and unrestricted access to the region. We have also urged China to implement urgently the eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, and have also called on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide regular information on the situation in the region, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed under international law. Most recently, Ireland raised these concerns during our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 15 March.</p>  <p>  Bilaterally, as is standard practice, my officials have discussed the situation in Xinjiang with the Chinese Ambassador and most recently have discussed, at senior level, the application of the EUGHRSR, as well as China's retaliatory actions.</p></reply>

Officials across these Departments have been working to clarify the details of the initiative, and the potential implications of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department has announced &euro;5 million in Irish Aid funding to support developing countries to access COVID-19 vaccines.  Most of this funding is going through the COVAX facility, a global UN-led mechanism for pooling procurement and fair distribution of the vaccines. This is part of at least &euro;50 million allocated by my Department to Global Health in 2021.</p></reply>

It sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces has established vaccine prioritisation which is in line with this national allocation strategy. Initial Vaccination priority is for Defence Force personnel who are providing front line support to the HSE and National Ambulance Service in the national effort to combat COVID 19. </p>  <p>  Personnel selected for deployment to overseas missions over the coming months will fall into a prioritised grouping, and the intention is that they will be vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to deployment, subject to availability of the vaccine which is coordinated through the HSE.  There may be a small number of personnel who, for a variety of reasons, will not be vaccinated against Covid 19 prior to their deployment. In these cases, it is intended that they will be prioritised on arrival in the mission to receive UN administered vaccines in accordance with each individual mission roll out timeline.</p>  <p>  As you will appreciate, there are significant logistical challenges in transporting and administering the  Covid 19 vaccines to large numbers of Defence Force personnel already deployed overseas on Peacekeeping duties.  </p>  <p>  As of 2 March 2021, Ireland is contributing 568 personnel to 10 different missions throughout the world. The main overseas mission in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed is the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 346 personnel.  These personnel are due to complete their tour of duty and return to Ireland during May.  They will be vaccinated on their return in accordance with the Defence Force prioritisation within the national allocation strategy.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Defence, I am keenly aware of the impact the COVID 19 pandemic is having on members of the Defence Forces  deployed overseas and their families.

The CMO has made it very clear in his advices to Government which are published on gov.ie, that schools are safe environments, with very little evidence of transmission within schools, and that the majority of infections of children and adolescents occurs outside the school setting. The decision to delay the reopening of schools was in recognition of the need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at a time where there was unprecedented levels of disease transmission in the community. This was not based on a changed assessment of the risks in relation to transmission levels in schools. </p>  <p>  Schools have put significant infection prevention control measures in place to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to/within the school and funding of almost &euro;650 million has been put in place by my Department to fund Covid-19 related measures, including funding for PPE, sanitation and additional cleaning etc.  </p>  <p>  The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has issued specific advice about children attending school in the context of Covid-19.  This advice covers both children with underlying medical conditions and children living with family members with underlying conditions.  For all children, care should continue to be taken to reduce transmission through the infection control measures promoted by HPSC.</p>  <p>  The HPSC advice advises that children with immediate family members, including parents, in both the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; categories can return to school and it is important for the child&rsquo;s overall well-being. This is consistent with public health advice internationally in relation to at-risk family members. The priority is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus, through regular hand washing, etc. </p>  <p>  My Department has also published guidance to support schools in making adapted education provision for students with an underlying medical condition who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk to COVID-19.</p></reply>

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.  </p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>There are currently sixteen special classes attached to mainstream primary and post-primary schools in Dublin 9 and Dublin 11, including 1 Early Intervention class, providing ASD placements for students in the area.</p><p>The NCSE is aware of an identified need for ASD classes at primary and post primary levels in the Dublin 9 and 11 areas and in the Fingal area as a whole.  Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is also aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.</p><p>The NCSE is working with a significant number of schools in this area to encourage and support the opening of new special classes at all levels and has specific plans in place to increase the number of places available.</p><p>I should also clarify that the NCSE does not maintain waiting lists for schools.  Boards of management of individual schools are responsible for such enrolment matters.</p><p>My Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education and I want to reassure you that the delivery of the necessary additional provision is being progressed as an absolute priority.</p><p>In circumstances, where no placement is available for a child with special educational needs, the Department can provide Home Tuition grant funding towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available. </p><p>I can also reassure the Deputy that the local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: <i></i>. </p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes is available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing live schools as opposed to the amalgamation and/or closure model of the patronage divesting process.  </p>  <p>  The initial identification phase of the process involved each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETB) identifying an initial pilot area within their functional area where they considered there may be unmet oncoming demand for a multi-/non-denominational school and arranging for surveys of parents of pre-school children in these areas.</p>  <p>  My Department officials have been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next Phase of the process. The identification phase work provides useful learning and is informing the development of the process.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Early Movers&rdquo; provision of the Schools Reconfiguration process enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process envisaged as part of the Reconfiguration process) to engage with their school patron on the matter. A patron may transfer patronage under section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  A number of patronage changes, including seven involving Catholic patrons, have taken place in recent years in this context, resulting in the provision of an additional 11 multi-denominational Community National Schools. School communities who wish to explore the potential to transfer patronage should contact their school patron in the first instance. </p>  <p>  In parallel with the Reconfiguration process, my Department is continuing to work with stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified as part of the 2012 and 2013 patronage divesting process surveys. 12 schools have been established under this process, all of which have a multi-denominational ethos.</p></reply>

The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition.

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports</p><p>This policy is supported by significant investment by this Government.  The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.</p><p>It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.  </p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is also aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.</p><p>The NCSE is working with a significant number of schools in this area to encourage and support the opening of new special classes at all levels and has specific plans in place to increase the number of places available.</p><p>I should also clarify that the NCSE does not maintain waiting lists for schools.  Boards of management of individual schools are responsible for such enrolment matters.</p><p>I can reassure the Deputy that the local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: . </p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie</p></reply>

However, in line with the guidance provided by my Department, it is important that schools regularly engage with pupils/students who may not be engaging or have disengaged with remote learning at this time. Any records kept in relation to engagement during school closure periods are retained at school level and my Department does not collect this data.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the best efforts made by schools to contact pupils/students and their parents, in instances where there is no engagement with learning, or where pupils/students have disengaged, it is good practice to notify Tusla Education Support Service (TESS). It is important that TESS is made aware of such instances so that they can engage with families to provide appropriate advice and support.</p>  <p>  TESS has a statutory responsibility to intervene when a parent/guardian is failing or neglecting his/her child&rsquo;s attendance at school. TESS views all school attendance referrals from a child welfare perspective with the intention of finding solutions that will enable and support pupils/students to attend, participate and be retained in education. The role of TESS is to ensure that all pupils/students have access to education and the service is available to work with any student or family in need of support.</p></reply>

Students who have a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder from CAMH or Clinical Psychology HSE services would have a long term mental health issue which would warrant a medical diagnosis. Experiencing short term related anxiety related to COVID 19 is seen as a normal reaction to abnormal events. It&rsquo;s normal to feel anxious when things are changed.</p><p>My Department recognises that we are likely to see a variety of responses amongst our students as schools reopen ranging from excitement and happiness to worry and anxiety, which are normal responses to unprecedented events. Normalising feelings by communicating that we have all struggled with aspects of the latest school closure and school reopening, will help to create a safe environment for students.  </p><p>With regard to the provision of education for children who are extremely vulnerable to COVID-19, I would like to draw your attention to Guidance published by my Department in relation to students who have been medically certified as being at very high risk from COVID-19. That Guidance is available at: </p><p>As that Guidance indicates, it is the responsibility of parents/guardians to seek medical advice and certification to indicate if their child is at very high risk to COVID-19 and to inform the school of this. Where a school receives such medical certification, it will organise the most appropriate support for the student concerned.  The Guidance sets out a number of options for schools to facilitate adapted education provision for students at very high risk to COVID-19.</p><p>It also stresses the importance of schools putting in place measures so students who are unable to attend in such circumstances will remain as connected as possible with their own school community and classmates, that their learning will continue, as far as possible, in line with the curriculum and in a manner that is closely aligned to the learning of their peers in their various subject classes.</p><p>Schools are not required to make adapted education provision for students who are not themselves extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. The medical advice for those who may have immediate family members who are at risk is that the household continues to follow all current advice on how to minimise the risk of COVID-19 as set out on the HSE website  . Please note that detailed advice on specific measures within a household are included in </p><p>The wellbeing of all students is a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan in sustaining the safe and effective operation of schools as we continue to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In this context the National Psychological Service of the Department (NEPS) is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities on the return to school requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate, largely preventative and proactive.  This requires a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  The Department&rsquo;s response is aligned with the HSE guidance and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope. </p></reply>

It eliminates the need for individual applications and professional assessments in order to access resources and facilitates schools allocating the available resources to those with greatest need. </p>  <p>  It had been planned that the frontloaded model of allocation for SNAs would be rolled out to all schools from the commencement of the 2020/21 school year.  </p>  <p>  Under the frontloaded allocation model, no schools would receive an allocation of SNA support for mainstream classes which is less than their existing 2019/20 mainstream SNA allocation on the introduction of the frontloaded model and some schools will gain.</p>  <p>  However, due to the disruption caused by Covid-19 and the closure of school buildings in March 2020. It was decided that the introduction of the model would be deferred for one year i.e. to the start of the 2021/22 school year.  This will allow time for the necessary planning and training for schools.</p>  <p>  As an interim step, SNA allocations were frozen at their current levels for 2020/21 with provision for additionality where necessary. Department Circular 30/2020 sets out the arrangements for SNA allocations for the 2020/21 school year. This meant that no school received an allocation less then what they had on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs in standard SNA posts could continue in these posts.</p>  <p>  Schools were advised in the first instance to review and reprioritise deployment of all SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources on the basis that those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. </p>  <p>  Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014. SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p>  <p>  Where schools consider their SNA allocation to be inadequate to meet current needs, a school can seek a review by making an application to the NCSE which is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p>  <p>  Schools will be advised, as soon as possible, in relation to the manner in which allocations of SNA support will be made for mainstream school classes for the 2021/22 school year.</p></reply>

Out-of-School Subjects refers to students who are enrolled in, and studying in, a school on a full time basis but are also studying an extra subject, or subjects, entirely outside of school. Out-of-School Learners refers to students who are entered for the examinations as external candidates and who are not attending for fulltime tuition at any school, or private college, recognised by the State Examinations Commission. Every effort will be made to provide Accredited Grades to as many students as possible, provided that there is evidence, on which an estimated percentage mark can be based.</p></reply>

This guidance is all available at <i>gov.ie</i>.</p><p>As part of the &euro;210m investment programme underpinning the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools,  my Department provided &euro;100m in grant funding to schools to address their ICT needs during 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions as is the current situation. This can include the purchase of ICT devices including laptops, etc. that can be shared with students and teachers who do not have access to devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning. </p><p>ICT grant funding issues directly to schools, as schools are best placed to identify the needs of their learners and to meet those requirements. Many schools have used this funding to put in place a device loan scheme to support families.</p><p>In an effort to support students and families a process to zero rate educational websites was put in place during the first lockdown, as announced by the then Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications. I am advised that the zero rating has been maintained by a number of telecoms providers and also that there is a range of unlimited mobile data packages on offer by the market. Decisions regarding home broadband and access for children are, of course, determined by parents/guardians. </p><p>Separate to the ICT funding, my Department invests an average of &euro;13m annually for the delivery of the Schools Broadband Programme (SBP) and some 98% of schools are included in this programme.  </p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs.  </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides its service to schools through casework and through support and development work for schools. Individual casework service involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s Special Education Teaching team or Student Support Team feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. </p>  <p>  At post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020/21 school year in response to Covid 19. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  </p>  <p>  In addition to casework NEPS psychologists work with teachers to build their capacity/capability to promote the wellbeing and mental health of children and young people in schools.  NEPS teams offer training and guidance for teachers in the provision of universal and targeted evidence-informed approaches and early intervention to promote children&rsquo;s wellbeing, social, emotional and academic development. Initiatives such as the Incredible Years Social Emotional learning Programmes and the FRIENDS Resilience Programmes. These programmes have been welcomed by schools and their impact positively evaluated.  </p>  <p>  NEPS is currently developing a range of workshops for school staff on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which includes trauma informed approaches.  The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. Work is underway to identify schools for inclusion in a pilot of the workshops.   In selecting schools, a mix of DEIS, non DEIS and urban and rural schools will be included. Following the pilot a national roll-out is planned during the next academic year. </p>  <p>  In the event that the need for a more specialised intervention or counselling is identified by the NEPS psychologist, a referral is made to an outside agency for evaluation and ongoing support.  The NEPS psychologist can in consultation with the Guidance Counsellor identify the most appropriate referral pathway and support schools with the onward referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team (CAMHS), HSE Primary Care/Community Psychology teams, or an identified local community based specialist mental health service.  </p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at <i>www.education.ie</i></p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.  </p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.</p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>Children who have additional learning needs in school, including children with ADHD, may receive additional teaching support in schools.</p></reply>

It eliminates the need for individual applications and professional assessments in order to access resources and facilitates schools allocating the available resources to those with greatest need. </p>  <p>  It had been planned that the frontloaded model of allocation for SNAs would be rolled out to all schools from the commencement of the 2020/21 school year.  </p>  <p>  Under the frontloaded allocation model, no schools would receive an allocation of SNA support for mainstream classes which is less than their existing 2019/20 mainstream SNA allocation on the introduction of the frontloaded model and some schools will gain.</p>  <p>  However, due to the disruption caused by Covid-19 and the closure of school buildings in March 2020. It was decided that the introduction of the model would be deferred for one year i.e. to the start of the 2021/22 school year.  This will allow time for the necessary planning and training for schools.</p>  <p>  As an interim step, SNA allocations were frozen at their current levels for 2020/21 with provision for additionality where necessary. Department Circular 30/2020 sets out the arrangements for SNA allocations for the 2020/21 school year. This meant that no school received an allocation less then what they had on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs in standard SNA posts could continue in these posts.</p>  <p>  Schools were advised in the first instance to review and reprioritise deployment of all SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources on the basis that those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. </p>  <p>  Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014. SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p>  <p>  Where schools consider their SNA allocation to be inadequate to meet current needs, a school can seek a review by making an application to the NCSE which is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p>  <p>  Schools will be advised, as soon as possible, in relation to the manner in which allocations of SNA support will be made for mainstream school classes for the 2021/22 school year.</p></reply>

This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission.</p><p>If a student has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, the parent/guardian may, but are not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission.  Where refused admission is for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and the parent/guardian does not choose to seek a review by the board of management they may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p><p>Full details on the section 29 appeals process are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link below:</p><p>  </p><p>In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS)  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

Currently investment of some &euro;13m is allocated annually for the provision of internet connectivity to schools. As you will be aware, broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on local infrastructure which can impact on the service that can be provided in individual schools.</p>  <p>  The primary broadband scheme operates off existing infrastructure on the whole and the providers on the Primary Broadband Framework access this infrastructure to deliver the service to the schools. All post-primary schools are provided with high speed connectivity through the Department's High Speed Programme for Post-Primary Schools.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the implementation of the National Broadband Plan Intervention area, which will see almost 700 primary schools provided with high speed connectivity by the end of 2022. This includes the School Connection Points under the Broadband Connection Points programme implementation currently underway.</p>  <p>  In operating the Schools Broadband Programme, my Department adheres to  procurement regulations, and must engage with the selected retail service providers on the DE Framework of Providers of Broadband Services through a tender process to award services. As and when improvements in infrastructure providing high speed connectivity is put in place, either through industry provision or the NBP implementation,  the retail service providers on the Primary Schools Broadband Framework will be in a position to utilise this in providing connectivity through my Department's Broadband Programme.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is on contracted service of 40 Mbp/s download through the Schools Broadband Programme, and will be upgraded through the Schools Broadband Programme when infrastructure becomes available to do so, in line with procurement and financial obligations. The school are advised to contact the Schools Broadband Service Desk on 1800 334466. to ensure that the school is receiving the maximum service on their current connection, and to investigate if internal networking issues may be impacting services in the school.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes. Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on extending the SIM.

Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid related work.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.1637.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100101#WRGG03700"><p>From the outset of this COVID-19 pandemic NEPS has been proactive in supporting schools through the development of advice and supports in priority areas.  On the ground, at local level NEPS psychologists have continued the delivery of a psychological service to schools.  As schools reopened in September 2020 the focus of NEPS work in school was on consultation and individual casework/assessment using a blended approach, working both remotely, and in-school, depending on school protocols/plans and of the nature of need.  The purpose of this focus was to support schools in relation to the wellbeing of students and to support the additional needs of individual students, including those transitioning to post-primary school.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service delivers a tiered, consultative model of service. Each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with difficulties including those with developmental delay. Teachers consult with their NEPS psychologist for assistance should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts, in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become directly involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological support. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for diagnosis of ASD falls outside of the remit of NEPS and is undertaken by the HSE.  </p>  <p>  I understand that NEPS has spoken directly with the Deputy&rsquo;s office in regard to her concerns and will liaise directly in relation to her specific queries question.</p></reply>

Initial teacher education courses for primary teachers moved to a four year degree from 2012 and post graduate programmes for primary and post primary moved to a two year Masters from September 2014 thereby facilitating an innovative reconceptualisation of programmes.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that as Minister for Education, I have responsibility for approving the continuation of the two-year Primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) Professional Master of Education (PME) programme in the four State-funded primary Higher Education Institutions (HEs) and setting the annual intake on this programme having regard to teacher supply and demand issues, and available resources. However, I have no similar role in setting the number of students admitted to the Post Primary Programmes of Initial Teacher Education.  This is a matter for individual Higher Education Institutes.</p>  <p>  The total approved annual intake on the primary PME in the 4 state funded HEIs was 330 places in its first year of inception (2014) and 200 places in each academic year thereafter. The increased intake in 2014 was approved as an exceptional measure to ensure sufficient supply of teachers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.1649.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100101#WRGG04900"><p>Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including children who are deaf/hard of hearing, can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs. </p>  <p>  The State currently spends approximately &euro;2 Billion - almost a fifth - of its annual educational and training budget on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.</p>  <p>  Included in this provision is an extensive range of supports to assist students who are deaf or hard of hearing. </p>  <p>  In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children who are deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) provides additional special educational needs teaching supports to mainstream schools, and provides for special class and special school placements and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support to all schools.</p>  <p>  The NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service includes Visiting Teachers, who are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.</p>  <p>  Each visiting teacher (VT) is responsible for a particular region and is allocated a caseload of students. The VT supports children/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child. </p>  <p>  The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs. </p>  <p>  The NCSE provide direct support to schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible, offering telephone advice, a school visit from a member of the team, an in-service course for individual teachers, or whole-school training. Whole-school training will ensure that all teachers are equipped to cater for the pupils&rsquo; educational needs, as they progress through primary and post primary school.</p>  <p>  Among the courses towards which funding is provided to schools are courses in Irish Sign Language, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.</p>  <p>  Additional supports provided by my Department include funding to schools for assistive technology such as radio aids and Soundfield systems, special transport arrangements for pupils, and enhanced levels of capitation in special classes and special schools.</p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents/guardians and grandparents. </p>  <p>  Reasibable accommodation and supports are made available to support students with special educational needs, including students who are Dead/hard of hearing, to participate in state examinations. </p>  <p>  The NCSE published the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme in May 2018. The report recommends that Irish Sign Language (ISL) qualified assistants should be put in place to support profoundly deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017.</p>  <p>  This recommendation is currently being considered. In the interim, schools may apply to the NCSE to appoint a person with appropriate ISL qualifications to support children with particular support needs in this area. They are employed on similar terms and conditions to SNAs. The purpose of these posts is to enable these students attend school and access the curriculum.</p>  <p>  A new undergraduate programme, Bachelor of Education (Irish Sign Language), in Dublin City University (DCU), launched in 2019, enables deaf and hard of hearing people who use Irish Sign Language (ISL) to enter primary teaching.</p>  <p>  Previously, there was no entry route to primary teacher education for someone who communicates through ISL and could not meet the minimum entry requirement for Irish in Leaving Certificate. This B.Ed. allows ISL to be accepted as an alternative to Irish. It is an important step towards ensuring increased access and inclusion for all in the classroom.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that, when qualified, these students will teach in schools for the deaf or special classes in mainstream schools. These qualified teachers will have a high level of ability in ISL, in-depth knowledge of bilingual education and the ability to teach all of the curriculum subjects through ISL. It will further aid deaf children who use Irish Sign Language in primary school to fully access the curriculum by having teachers who are fluent ISL users. </p>  <p>  This new Bachelor of Education (ISL) is approved by the Department of Education and accredited by the Teaching Council.</p></reply>

The areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness are addressed through a suite of supports and the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) provided by Department-funded support services to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level.  </p><p>The programme for CPD provided to schools includes Team Teaching where special education teachers and classroom teachers deepen their understanding of inclusive teaching and learning practices and effective models of team teaching.  CPD is being provided for inclusion through team teaching at both primary and post primary levels through bespoke school support. </p><p>CPD for Social, personal and health education (SPHE) at primary and post-primary level is continuing through online provision in 2020/2021.  Teachers can address teaching children respect for and an appreciation of human and cultural diversity through the SPHE curriculum.  </p><p>The Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019) acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach to supporting well-being, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health. </p><p>At both primary and post-primary levels through Term 2 and 3 2020/2021, the PDST are facilitating online Workshops on the Introduction to the Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice &ndash; (WPSFP) This CPD facilitates schools to examine the promotion of well-being in a multi-faceted approach to the betterment of the whole school community.  </p><p>In addition to the above supports provided for CPD, the Teaching Council carried out a review of the standards for programmes of ITE, <i>Initial Teacher Education: Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers. </i>The review was informed by extensive engagement with the Department of Education, the Higher Education Institutes, relevant stakeholders and commissioned research on school placement.  </p><p>Following completion of the review of the Criteria and Guidelines, the updated standards document, <i>C&eacute;im &ndash; Standards for ITE</i>was published by the Teaching Council in November 2020.  As part of this review the areas of intercultural, anti-racism and diversity have now been given greater prominence in the new Standards for ITE and Global Citizenship Education is now included as one of the seven core elements of ITE, to include Education for Sustainable Development; Well-being (personal and community); Social Justice, Inter culturalism.  The revised standards define inclusive education as &lsquo;any aspect of teachers&rsquo; learning aimed at improving their capacity to address and respond to the diversity of learners&rsquo; needs; to enable their participation in learning; and remove barriers to education through the accommodation and provision of appropriate structures and arrangements to enable each learner to achieve the maximum benefit from his /her attendance at school.&rsquo;  Furthermore, the standards reference that &lsquo;the Council&rsquo;s view of a truly inclusive approach to professional practice recognises that teachers encounter a diverse range of needs in the course of their teaching, regardless of setting. This will include additional learning needs (e.g. autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia) and learning needs associated with diverse linguistic, socioeconomic, cultural and ethnic (including Traveller community, Roma) backgrounds.&rsquo; </p><p>As part of the Review and Accreditation process, all programmes of initial teacher education will have to provide evidence of how the Core Elements are explored and examined with student teachers during the course of their ITE programme. It is also envisaged that the revised procedures for review and accreditation will include a thematic review, which will focus on specific areas of the curriculum/ ITE programme.  All new programmes submitted to the Teaching Council for accreditation must now be in alignment with <i>C&eacute;im.</i>It is anticipated that existing programmes of ITE will be realigned in accordance with <i>C&eacute;im</i>for commencement in September 2022. </p><p>With regard to anti &ndash;bullying procedures, The Action Plan on Bullying, published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. It recommended 12 actions that focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying including identity based bullying are addressed.  National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary schools, published in September 2013 are being implemented in all 4,000 primary and post primary schools throughout the country. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour including identity based bullying amongst their pupils.  The procedures make clear that the definition of bullying behaviour includes identity-based bullying such as racist bullying. The procedures require that the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of a school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy.  </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate monitors schools&rsquo; anti-bullying measures in primary, post-primary and centres for education during a number of inspection types, including whole school evaluations, curriculum/subject inspections of Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) and child protection and safeguarding inspections. During whole school evaluations (WSE), schools are required to provide evidence that their anti-bullying procedures are in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools (2013).  </p><p>In 2019, the NCCA published a curriculum audit on Traveller history and culture. The audit identified areas across the curriculum where teachers could teach about aspects of Traveller history and culture. The audit addressed the curriculum from Early Years, Primary and Post-Primary. The audit is available at:<i></i></p><p>NCCA is currently developing a report on Traveller culture and history to support learning and teaching of the curriculum. The report will include information on the history and cultural practices of the Traveller community as well as practical examples from schools and settings. The report aims to support teachers and school leaders on teaching and learning about Traveller history and culture. </p><p>The NCCA published Intercultural Guidelines for Primary and Post-Primary. These guidelines support the Primary School Curriculum (1999) and post-primary curricula by identifying the ways in which intercultural education permeates that curriculum. The aim of these guidelines is to contribute to the development of Ireland as an intercultural society based on a shared sense that language, culture and ethnic diversity is valuable. NCCA will be commencing a review of the Intercultural Education guidelines in 2021/2022 to ensure they continue to reflect curriculum developments in intercultural education.</p></reply>

This process is ongoing.  </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. The NCSE provides a programme of teacher professional learning and in-school support to support schools in establishing special classes.</p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, I am acutely aware that there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.  For September 2021, the NCSE is aware of a specific identified need for special school placements in Cork City and County and is working with my Department and the education partners towards meeting that need. A number of options are currently being explored to increase the number of places to cater for the needs of children in this area. I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for all concerned.  </p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>NCSE is aware of those parents whose children are seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.</p><p>In circumstances, where no placement is available for a child with special educational needs, the Department can provide Home Tuition grant funding towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available.  </p><p>The NCSE, through its local network of SENOs (Special Educational Needs Organisers), is available to provide advice and support to parents and may be contacted directly by parents using the contact details available at: <i></i>. </p><p>I understand that the child in question is seeking a special school placement for the 2022/23 academic year and that the NCSE's local SENO is currently engaging with, and remains available, to support the family . </p></reply>

Other areas looked at included, but were not limited to: developments in relation to contraception; healthy, positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet; the role of school ethos: and, LGBTQ+ matters.</p><p>The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA on 11th of December, 2019.</p><p>As part of the review of RSE an extensive consultation occurred. Feedback was facilitated through an online survey, written submissions, round-table meetings and large events. Adjustments were made to the final report to reflect a stronger focus on issues that stakeholders wished to see highlighted, such as gender discrimination, sexual violence and pornography. </p><p>The purpose of the review was to examine the current experience of RSE within schools, the approach to teaching and learning, supports needed, and what is needed to improve RSE.  It was not within the remit of the review or the Report to set out in detail what students should learn about in an updated RSE curriculum. Such considerations will be part of the work arising from the NCCA Report. The work in redeveloping and updating the curriculum is being undertaken within the curriculum development structures in the NCCA and there will be opportunities for public and stakeholder engagement in this process.  </p><p>The Report does not set out an exhaustive list of the topics that will be included in any future SPHE/RSE curriculum or details on how any specific topic might be taught or contextualised. Important issues such as Consent need to be taught within a wider context of particular issues and it is the view of the NCCA that guidance materials and professional development for teachers are needed to create this wider understanding of what is involved. </p><p>In this context, the NCCA is currently working to develop updated guidance materials for the teaching of SPHE/RSE (which will take the form of an online SPHE/RSE toolkit), and this will also include a repository of SPHE/RSE teaching resources.  <b></b></p><p>Pending commencement of a comprehensive update of the curriculum, the NCCA were initially asked to begin work in January 2020 on interim guidelines to support the teaching of SPHE/RSE in schools, The NCCA is currently developing this interim guidance for SPHE and RSE across primary and post-primary levels. These support materials will be made available in the form of an online toolkit. They will provide guidance on how the current curriculum can be approached in a more holistic way. The materials involved are being brought to the NCCA development groups from October 2020 onwards on an ongoing basis. It is anticipated that initial guidance materials will be supplemented incrementally during 2021. </p><p>The NCCA has worked collaboratively with the teacher professional development support services and other relevant groups in completing an audit of current teaching and learning resources relevant to SPHE/RSE and compiled a comprehensive resource list which will be published as part of the online toolkit for SPHE/RSE. This will provide a single, online access point for up-to-date resources.  </p><p>Other recommendations in the report in relation to Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) regarding SPHE and RSE are being reviewed by my Department with a view to putting enhanced supports in place.</p><p>Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE/RSE commenced in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work will include engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised. The NCCA curriculum development process includes extensive stakeholder consultation. The development of an updated RSE/SPHE curriculum will take approximately 12-18 months</p><p>The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work over recent months due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. However, the NCCA began convening ongoing meetings with these groups as of October 2020 which allows them to review significant work that has been progressed. Both the primary and post primary SPHE/RSE Development Groups have been meeting successfully via Zoom on a monthly basis since the groups were convened in October. </p><p>The immediate focus of the work in on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum. This work is progressing well and the first section of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE JC Short Course and SC SPHE Framework) is now published. </p><p>Further sections will be added over the coming weeks/months.

The ENP scheme is demand-led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  ENPs are not subject to the HRC. </p><p>The person concerned made an application for SWA on 22/2/2021 and was paid an ENP pending a decision on this application.</p><p>As stated above, in order to qualify for SWA, a person must, inter alia, satisfy the requirement to be habitually resident in the State.  The person concerned failed to produce documentation requested by the Designated Officer, including any evidence of the right to reside in the State.  As a result, a letter was issued on 18/3/2021 to inform the person concerned that the application was disallowed, and of the right to seek a review or appeal of this decision.</p><p>It has since been confirmed that the person concerned does not hold a valid permission in the State, is the subject of a valid deportation order issued by the Minister for Justice, failed to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), and is now classed as an evader.  The person concerned has apparently requested the revocation of the deportation order on ill health grounds but a decision has not been reached.  If this is the case, the person concerned can apply to the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) to be accommodated pending the outcome of his appeal application.  This can be done by sending an email to <i>ipasinbox@equality.gov.ie</i>confirming Name, Date of Birth and ID number.  The person will then be required to submit a declaration of means and his request will be assessed regarding his eligibility.</p><p>My Department will consider whether a further ENP on a once off basis may be appropriate in the circumstances.</p><p>I trust  this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid where a particular contingency arises,  without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly, there is the solidarity principle. Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.</p>  <p>  There is also a general principle of 'one person, one payment', which applies across the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, but generally, as these payments are to help them meet their income needs, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  Overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only ten individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  However, the social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.</p>  <p>  The concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, and Widows and Widowers Pensions was discontinued from January 2012, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients. </p>  <p>  The combined rates of payment if a person was to be paid both a full rate Widow's Contributory Pension and Illness Benefit (plus allowances), neither of which are subject to a means test, would be significantly higher than those paid to other people supported by my Department. </p>  <p>  To change the underlying principle of entitlement, and allow people to claim multiple payments would involve significant additional expenditure, which could prove unsustainable in the long-term, and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary contexts.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, given the scale of the social and economic impact of the pandemic, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible to properly process the huge volume of these jobseekers claims and, instead, the &euro;350 rate was introduced, which was aligned with the jobseekers payment for a 2 person household.  The rate was also roughly equivalent to average earnings in the two most affected sectors &ndash; retail and hospitality. </p>  <p>  Since 16 October 2020 PUP has been paid at 4 rates ranging from &euro;203 to &euro;350 and is aligned to prior gross earnings to ensure that the rate is fair and sustainable over the duration of the scheme, which has been extended until 30th June 2021. </p>  <p>  &euro;203 is paid where prior earnings were less than &euro;200 which is more than recipients were paid when they were working.  The rate of &euro;250 is paid where earnings were between &euro;200 and &euro;299.99.  It is estimated that on average, most recipients on this rate are receiving more on PUP than when they were working or at least almost 84% of their prior nett income.  &euro;300 is paid where prior earnings were between &euro;300 and &euro;399.99 which on average equates to 86% of prior employment earnings for a single person.</p>  <p>  The maximum rate of &euro;350 is paid where prior earnings were &euro;400 or more.  </p>  <p>  The ESRI undertook a social assessment of the impact of the of the proposed 4 PUP rates before their introduction in October 2020.  The analysis considered the distributional effects of the new PUP rates with reference to changes in household disposable income by income, family type and the impact upon poverty rates.  The effects of the new PUP rates indicate that the changes result in a very small reduction in disposable income of just above one per cent.  The analysis indicates that the new PUP rates would increase slightly the at-risk of poverty rates for everyone by 0.6 of a percentage point.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that where there are adults or child dependents a person can opt for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment if their prior earnings were below the earnings band to qualify for a higher rate of PUP. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department provides for additional targeted income supports for those, including PUP recipients, who are experiencing financial difficulties, under the means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme such as Rent Supplement, Fuel Allowance and Urgent and Exceptional Needs payments where appropriate. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for you at this time. </p></reply>

This is on foot of the Government&rsquo;s decision in 2017 to tender for a single banking service for all Government Departments and Offices, a contract which was awarded to Danske Bank in 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department uses the bank for both cheque and electronic fund transfer (EFT) payments, i.e. funds transferred directly into a person&rsquo;s account in a financial institution.  Payments to people resident outside the state are generally made by EFT as this is the most efficient and cost effective method of delivering a payment.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this month, the Department moved its foreign EFT payments to beneficiaries outside of the SEPA zone to Danske Bank.  As a result of this change, US and Canadian banks levied cross border payment charges on their own customers' Irish pension payments.  There are approximately 6,400 pension recipients in the US or Canada receiving a pension payment from this Department.  It is not known how many of these pension recipients are impacted by the charges.  However, the Department wrote to all such customers in January, informing them of the potential of charges being levied on their payments by their own bank.</p>  <p>  Payments to markets outside Ireland where the sending bank is not a member of the domestic clearing system, such as the US or Canada, are processed as international cross border payments, also known as &lsquo;international wire transfers&rsquo;.  Processing such payments as international wire transfers ensures that the sending bank complies with its national and international Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) obligations. In order to effect these international wire transfers in markets such as the US and Canada, the services of correspondent banks are necessary, and their use is the industry standard approach. </p>  <p>  Correspondent banks will deduct charges from the payment amount to compensate for the cost of processing the payment and discharging their AML and CTF obligations.</p>  <p>  Danske Bank is currently in contact with its correspondent banks in relation to the matter.</p></reply>

The person concerned was notified in writing of this decision on 29h January 2021 and was also notified of their right to request a review of this decision or to appeal it to the independent social welfare appeals office (SWAO). No request for an appeal or review was received. </p>  <p>  The person concerned submitted a second application for DA on 9 March 2021 and based on the additional information which was provided, her case was reviewed and she has been awarded with effect from her original application date on 9 December 2020.

For this reason it can require detailed investigations and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure you that my Department is committed to continuously improving the customer experience, and is currently reviewing the DA application form with a view to making it easier to complete.  This procedural change will provide a more focused approach in the provision of necessary documentation, and assist in the decision making process within current policy and legislation.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions for receiving DA is that a person must have an injury, disease or other disability and as a result of this disability, they must be substantially restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of similar age, experience and qualifications.</p>  <p>  Assessments of medical eligibility for DA are based on medical reports and other evidence furnished by the applicant and the applicant&rsquo;s doctors.  The Department does not dispute the diagnosis of the persons&rsquo; own doctors.  Eligibility is assessed on a case by case basis and is determined by its severity, and resultant effects on activities of daily living and work-related activities.  On receipt of additional medical evidence in this case, the medical criteria for DA was deemed to have been satisfied. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s role continues to be that of CE funder. </p><p>At this point, I want to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p><p>This issue of pensions was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p><p>In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with dealing with the specific issue as regards CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.</p><p>The Deputy should note that funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to determine within the wider budgetary framework and economic context in which any such scheme will need to operate.  <b></b></p><p>Within this context, officials from my Department and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform held discussions on proposals to progress this issue over the past number of months.  Following a recent discussion with Minister McGrath, I am optimistic that this issue will be progressed in the near future</p></reply>

The BTWEA is not designed to support individuals already in self-employment.  The scheme plays a vital role in supporting the development of new enterprises and supporting the first steps into self-employment for the long term unemployed.  </p>  <p>  Individuals who are currently self-employed have a range of other income support options available to them from the Department.  The individual referred to by the Deputy may be entitled to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), Jobseeker's Benefit or the means-tested Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance payment depending on their situation.  </p>  <p>  Self-employed individuals, including those in operating in the tourism sector, can engage in limited levels of self-employment and can earn up to &euro;960 over a rolling eight week period and continue to maintain entitlement to PUP.  Where a self-employed person exceeds this threshold they may apply for the Part Time Job Incentive for the self- employed scheme which enables a self-employed person who has been in receipt of the PUP to engage in self-employment for up to 24 hours per week and receive a personal weekly rate of payment of &euro;128.60. No income threshold is applied under this support. </p>  <p>  The Enterprise Support Grant (ESG) is also available to eligible self-employed recipients who close their PUP and reopen their business as restrictions begin to lift.  A once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000, to assist with the costs associated with reopening, is available under this measure.  The grant is payable to self-employed individuals who employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and who are not eligible for support from similar business reopening grants from other Departments.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position. </p></reply>

Last week, payments of the PUP issued to almost 450,00 people and to date expenditure on the scheme has been some &euro;6.5 billion.

The CIB, working closely with one of its Service Delivery companies, the Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS), has made progress in implementing these commitments.</p>  <p>  In relation to Section 7 of the ISL Act, the Register of Irish Sign Language Interpreters (RISLI) was established in December 2020.  Prior to establishment, CIB conducted significant research into international policies and standards, undertook extensive consultation with the Deaf community and other stakeholders, and developed and externally reviewed policies and procedures.  A separate company was also established to ensure operational independence of the Register. </p>  <p>  The first of its kind in Ireland, RISLI is a standards-based registration system for ISL interpreters.  It aims to strengthen and guarantee the quality of ISL provision in Ireland, by ensuring that Interpreters reach specified standards to be admitted on the Register.  RISLI also aims to support ISL interpreters to meet and maintain these standards by partaking in continuous professional development (CPD) to maintain their registration status.  There are currently 86 ISL Interpreters on the Register. </p>  <p>  In relation to Section 9, the establishment of the Register was a fundamental prerequisite for this commitment, in order to ensure that approved interpreters provide ISL interpreting as part of the scheme.  Extensive consultation with the Deaf community and a review of international practice were undertaken by CIB and SLI to inform a model for the scheme.  The commencement of a Pilot is now scheduled for Q2 2021, subject to compliance with public health guidelines in place at that time.  The Pilot is scheduled to run for three months and will be subject to review in order to inform a proposal for national rollout.</p>  <p>  In relation to my Department's commitments under Section 3 and Section 6 respectively, the Department provides an ISL Interpretation service to any customer who may request or need this service in order to interact or engage with the Department.  An in-person or remote service is currently available and in person ISL Interpreting services can be arranged where essential.  ISL Interpretation is provided free of charge to customers and the Department ensures that interpreters assigned to DSP are registered with RISLI.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

On receipt of a completed application at that time, the person&rsquo;s self-employment record will be verified.  Their pension entitlement can then be determined by a Deciding Officer, and they will be notified of the outcome.</p>  <p>  Under current eligibility conditions, applicants must have 520 full-rate paid contributions in order to qualify for standard State pension (contributory).  Calculation of an applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to State pension (contributory) is based on their social insurance record from their date of entry into insurable employment until pension age, currently 66 years.  </p>  <p>  PRSI for the self-employed was introduced from 6 April 1988.  Under social welfare legislation, if an applicant became a self-employed contributor on 6 April 1988, and at any time prior to that date was an employed contributor, the date on which the applicant first entered into insurance or the 6 April 1988, whichever is the more favourable to them, shall be regarded as the date of entry into insurance.</p>  <p>  According to the records of my Department, the person concerned commenced paying self-employment (class S) contributions in the 1990/91 tax year.  Since they did not pay class S social insurance on 6 April 1988 and began paying class S social insurance after this date, their date of entry must be taken from when they first entered insurable employment, the earlier date of 14 April 1976.  </p>  <p>  There is a gap in the person's social insurance record for the tax years from 1982/83 to 1989/90 inclusive.  It is open to them to provide documentary evidence for these years to my Department for review of their record.  The person concerned should also ensure that they have settled their self-employment liabilities in compliance with the requirements of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in advance of reaching pension age. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department provides financial support in the form of allowances and funding to assist with the JI programme including JI participant and team leader wages, materials and overheads grants.</p><p>Following a review of employment schemes in 2004, new recruitment onto Job Initiative (JI) ceased with effect from 10th November of that year.  Current JI participants on the programme remain eligible to have their contracts renewed by the Managing Agent on an annual basis.</p><p>JI was established as a working age activation scheme and participants who continue to be funded through JI must therefore be of working age.  As a consequence funding for JI participants is provided until the participant reaches 66, which is currently the state pension age.

The public consultation is one of a variety of consultative methods that are being employed to gather the views and insights of parents and other parenting support stakeholders. This includes a consultation conducted through interviews and focus groups with a wide range of parents. Summary reports of consultations completed to date can be found on the model's development information page on my Department's website. It is expected that further consultation with take place as key components of the model are developed. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that there are a number of factors that can prevent individuals from participating. To address this, my Department has contacted a wide range of representative bodies and groups that work with parents to raise awareness of the consultation and, where necessary, to support parents to participate. </p>  <p>  Additionally, to support accessibility the consultation questionnaire was developed using plain English and is hosted on EU Survey. EU Survey provides accessibility options including enhanced contrast for visually impaired participants and the option to complete the survey offline and submit at a later time when an internet connection is available.

The 2015 Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.  The 2015 Act is primarily the policy responsibility of my Department except for Part 8 of the 2015 Act which deals with advance healthcare planning and is the responsibility of the Department of Health.   </p>  <p>  My Department chairs the Inter-Departmental Steering Group (IDSG), previously under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, which includes the Decision Support Service, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health.  Its remit is to ensure that IDSG members are taking the actions necessary to ensure that the 2015 Act is commenced by June 2022.  To this end I secured a budget of &euro;5.8m for 2021 for the DSS to enable it to develop the necessary systems, including IT systems, to become operational.  My officials are also working on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which will provide necessary amendments to the 2015 Act, with the aim of enactment by year-end.  In the meantime, I will commence any sections of the 2015 Act that I can, bearing in mind the interconnectedness of the Act.  Last month I commenced section 7(1) which repealed the Marriage of Lunatics Act, 1811, and allows adults in wardship to marry if they have capacity to do so.  </p></reply>

The bag will also contain other branded resources including a booklet on getting the most from the books, a leaflet on the library services with the designated contact details for the library and a library card for each setting. The books will target the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) age range of 2.5 years to 5.5 years.

As part of a careful and cautious reopening of priority sectors of society and the economy, ELC and SAC have been opening for other groups of children throughout March on a phased basis:</p>  <p>  - From 8 March, the ECCE Programme reopened for all participating children; and</p>  <p>  - As of 29 March other restrictions have been lifted so that all other children can return to ELC and SAC services (i.e. those that are not the children of essential workers or not vulnerable children).</p>  <p>  To ensure that services were financially supported and in a position to re-open, the Covid-19 Operating Support Payment (COSP) introduced in February was extended until 26 March for eligible services. This was to help offset loss of parental fees for services which are highly reliant on private income.</p>  <p>  Both ELC and SAC services continue to be eligible for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and are exempt from the turnover rule. This has been providing a significant level of financial support to ELC and SAC services since it was launched. The Early Learning and Childcare providers continue to be eligible to access without having to demonstrate 30% reduction in turnover as other employers do.  The enhanced EWSS is estimated to cover 80% of payroll costs or 50% of full operating costs of this services. ELC/SAC services continue to be entitled to access the EWSS to end June 2021 and all are encouraged to do so.</p>  <p>  On 26 March this year, I also announced a new strand of Sustainability funding, COVID-19 Impact Support, which is available to both community and private ELC and SAC services that face financial deficits despite other support measures. This support will remain available throughout 2021. Any ELC or SAC service providers which think they may need this support should contact their local CCC in the first instance to discuss eligibility.</p>  <p>  Additional support is also available through the Case Management process. My Department oversees a Case Management process through which local CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care and school age childcare services experiencing difficulties. All services who require support should contact their local CCC in the first instance.</p>  <p>  I hope that these measures will ensure that all SAC services can continue to operate viably during and after the pandemic. </p></reply>

Ongoing training is available to all Sponsor Bodies, and Tusla is availing of this training. Training takes place via webinar and frequently asked questions are updated based on the questions asked during training and this is shared across Tusla staff. My Department, in conjunction with Tusla, reviews the training material, as well as the communications process to ensure that training reaches all of the relevant Tusla staff.  </p>  <p>  Training is also available to all childcare providers, through local City/County Childcare Committees nationwide. Childcare providers have been encouraged to engage with their local CCCs should they become aware of any challenges in accessing sponsor referral pathways. </p>  <p>  In addition, following the disruption to the sector from Covid-19 following the Christmas period, my Department reached out to Tusla during the Covid-19 crisis to ensure that vulnerable children were supported at this time. Tusla agreed to put processes in place expedite sponsor applications received in this period for children identified as being vulnerable. This has ensured access to early learning and care services for vulnerable children throughout the latest Covid-19 restrictions.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will continue to monitor the growth of the NCS and the embedding of the sponsor referral process within the relevant bodies.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy be aware of any families or providers who may be experiencing challenges in the sponsor process, they are advised to immediately contact the local CCC.

The Research and Evaluation Unit within DCEDIY has the benefit of a seconded statistician from the Central Statistics Office, and regularly draws on population data to support policy relevant analysis across the broad remit of the Department.  In particular, the Research Unit publishes a series of Statistical Spotlights on key topics such as Traveller and Roma Children; Family and Household Structure in Ireland; Young Carers in Ireland and The Reconciliation of Work and Family Life.</p>  <p>  Additionally, DCEDIY uses population growth data to inform the provision of Early Years and Youth programmes:</p>  <p> - For the ECCE (Pre-school) Programme, the Department prepares an annual forecast of demand for ECCE Programme places. Estimates are derived using a range of administrative and survey data sources. The total eligible cohort is derived from birth data provided by the Central Statistics Office. Overall uptake is derived through the examination of trends in uptake since the introduction of the programme, data from Growing Up in Ireland, and data from the Pupil Online Database held by the Department of Education. Since the extension of the Programme in 2016, data on school starting age - also from the Pupil Online Database - has also been used. The Department also accesses data on the number of children in the ECCE-eligible cohort at electoral division level, which provides a robust indication of demand for ECCE places at a local level.</p>  <p>  Unlike the ECCE Programme, which enjoys a near universal take-up and straightforward eligibility criteria, there is significant uncertainties when it comes to demand for other early learning and care and school-age childcare. Uncertain demand arises for a number of reasons including parental preferences for centre-based early learning and care and school-age childcare vs. childminding and relative care, female labour market participation rates and intensity and future economic trends. The introduction of the National Childcare Scheme, where eligibility for a universal subsidy is determined by age and eligibility for a targeted subsidy determine by age and income, greatly simplifies the process of estimating demand. The Department has also joined the ESRI SWITCH research programme. This assists with further removing uncertainty with regard to for example parental preferences and female labour force participation rates.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, Pobal, on behalf of the Department undertakes an annual survey of  early learning and care and school-age childcare service providers. Among the data gathered through this survey is information on the number of children enrolled and those on waiting lists, as well as information on vacant places in these services.</p>  <p>   First 5 seeks to build on these efforts. Actions include: strengthening capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand in early learning and care and school-age childcare by undertaking a regular national need assessment.</p>  <p> - The &lsquo;UBU Your Place Your Space&rsquo; scheme is a targeted youth funding scheme which provides out-of-school supports in local communities to marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable young people between the age of 10 and 24. It is underpinned by the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement (APNASR) process which allows for the gathering and analysis of available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their functional area. This data capture pays cognisance to changes in population within Education &amp;amp; Training Board (ETB) areas. The ETB carries out an analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data to identify and evidence the needs of young people which informs future service provision.</p></reply>

It is a very successful programme with an estimated participation of 95% of children in the eligible age range. </p>  <p>  Some early learning and childcare services provide just the ECCE programme, whereas others provide ECCE as well as providing a longer duration of service.  Some providers offer both morning and afternoon ECCE sessions.  As early learning and childcare is delivered by independent providers, in both the private and community sectors, the types of services offered and the hours during which they are offered are matters for individual providers. </p></reply>

It has operated for several years by providing either pre-award funding or a post-award bursary. The initiative was initially rolled out from 2014 to support the introduction of the minimum National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) Level 5 qualification requirement that came into force in 2016, to allow practitioners who were already working in a setting to meet the new minimum requirement. Since then, the Learner Fund bursary has been extended to provide financial support for practitioners undertaking a range of other training and education programmes for awards at Level 5 to Level 9 on the NFQ.</p>  <p>  As part of the overall Learner Fund, since 2019 Learner Fund bursaries have been opened to childminders who achieve a level 5 or level 6 major award in early childhood care and education recognised on the NFQ and who register with Tusla. Childminders who are registered with Tusla can also avail of the Learner Fund graduate bursary for level 7 and 8 and 9 graduate-level awards in early learning and care.</p>  <p>  In 2020, a total of &euro;300,000 was spent on the overall Learner Fund bursary programme. This includes both the graduate and childminder bursaries which operate simultaneously and are funded from the same budget.</p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the Learner Fund saw bursaries awarded to 397 applicants for completion of relevant degrees (who may include both centre-based practitioners and childminders), and 3 Tusla-registered childminders for completion of Level 5/6 awards (following receipt of 3 applications). The Learner Fund round for 2021 will open for applications later in the year.</p>  <p>  The number of childminders availing of the Learner Fund is expected to remain very low until regulation is extended to all childminders and bespoke training and qualifications are developed for childminders. Currently there are 77 Tusla-registered childminders. In line with commitments in First 5 and the Programme for Government, a Childminding Action Plan will be published in April 2021. The Childminding Action Plan will seek to extend the scope of regulation and supports for childminders, accelerate access to subsidies for childminders through the National Childcare Scheme, and develop bespoke training for childminders.</p></reply>

It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of people with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide coordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent Chairperson, Fergus Finlay. Currently the group is monitoring the CES Phase Two Action Plan which covers the period 2019 &ndash; 2021.   </p>  <p>  Accessing and staying in employment for people with disabilities is difficult but can be achieved with appropriate supports.  It requires many Government services to work for that individual and importantly to work together to provide a joined-up service.  The Action Plan contains a range of actions, to be carried out by Government Departments and agencies, to advance the strategic priorities and ultimately to increase the numbers of those with disabilities in employment.  </p>  <p>  Separately, the Government will bring forward legislative proposals this year to increase the percentage target of people with disabilities employed in the public service from 3% to 6%.</p></reply>

The standard applied by Tusla reflects the community-focused integrated response for victims, where community-based organisations and outreach supports are in place alongside refuges.</p>  <p>  A review of domestic violence accommodation, currently underway by Tusla, will examine the capacity of current accommodation for victims of DSGBV and the level of need across the country. The Monitoring Group for the Second National Strategy for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, led by the Department of Justice, will engage with the findings of the Tusla review and its final recommendations. The Monitoring Group includes representatives from the DSGBV sector as well as officials from relevant Government bodies.</p>  <p>  The Convention also requires that signatories supply a freephone national helpline for victims of DSGBV. Tusla provides financial support to Women's Aid and Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to provide two 24-hour helplines for victims of domestic and sexual violence. This funding has increased in the context of COVID-19. In addition to the requirements of the Convention, Tusla also provides funding to the Men's Development Network and Men's Aid to operate two helplines for male victims of abuse.</p>  <p>  Tusla also continues to support front-line staff within its own services, commissioned services, and other relevant stakeholders with training in order to support victims in the most effective way.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice led on the 2018 Domestic Violence Act which paved the way for ratification of the Convention.

The IDG has agreed and adopted a plan for the development of the service nationally, based on learning captured from the development and implementation of the initial Galway service. </p>  <p>  The Galway service continues to operate the Barnahus model. A long term building is being remodelled and fitted out to accommodate both the adult SATU (Sexual Assault Treatment Unit) service and the child centred Barnahus centre, which will have separate access.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that Barnahus and SATU services will align where possible to facilitate the close working relationship needed where the victim is a teenager who may need a mix of adult (forensic) services and a child protection service.</p>  <p>  The IDG has established the National Agency Steering Committee (NASC), comprised of senior managers from Tusla, AGS, HSE and Children&rsquo;s Hospital Ireland. This Committee convened in January 2021 and has had three meetings to date as they organise and oversee operational matters associated with the development and management of Barnahus nationally.  </p>  <p>  It is proposed that the Barnahus model will operate in three locations- Barnahus West, Barhanus South and Barnahus East where the main service will be located in Galway, Cork and Dublin. Over time it is planned that centres will develop regional outreach capacity.</p>  <p>  Barnahus developmental budget requests for staff for health, therapy, child protection and criminal matters will be progressed by the respective agencies through the estimates process to the relevant Departments. </p>  <p>  The IDG will continue to meet and hold a policy and advisory role for the overall service. Progress challenges and supports for the development of the national service will be reported through IDG members and the reporting structure in place for the NASC.</p></reply>

It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of people with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide coordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent Chairperson: Fergus Finlay. Currently the group is monitoring the CES Phase Two Action Plan which covers the period 2019 &ndash; 2021.   </p>  <p>  Accessing and staying in employment for people with disabilities is difficult but can be achieved with appropriate supports.  It requires many Government services to work for that individual and importantly to work together to provide a joined-up service.  The Action Plan contains a range of actions, to be carried out by Government Departments and agencies, to advance the strategic priorities and ultimately to increase the numbers of those with disabilities in employment.  </p>  <p>  Separately, the Government will bring forward legislative proposals this year to increase the percentage target of people with disabilities employed in the public service from 3% to 6%.</p></reply>

This only occurs where it is appropriate and safe to do so. In establishing this a parental capacity assessment is conducted. </p>  <p>  Parenting capacity is the ability to parent in a capable manner long term. An individual may be able to parent for a short period of time in specific circumstances (e.g. a supervised visit) and therefore demonstrate parenting ability, but not the parenting capacity to parent effectively over the long term. Key areas of parenting capacity are basic care, ensuring safety, emotional warmth, stimulation, guidance and boundaries, and stability.</p>  <p>  The Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook details the approach to conducting an assessment and social workers will have received training in this regard, providing a degree of uniformity and quality to assessments conducted.</p>  <p>  In addition Social workers in Tusla are using Signs of Safety as the national approach to practice, and assessments and plans resulting from the assessments have been aligned with that model. This should further ensure a level of consistency between Tusla areas. Of course, no family will receive an identical service as each service should be tailored to meet the needs of the child and family appropriately. </p>  <p>  In instances where commissioned assessments, involving professionals outside of the social work team, attachment specialists, independent social workers and psychologists are being developed they too should align with Signs of Safety ensuring a consistent approach to assessments.</p></reply>

This Strategy remains a key commitment for my Department as part of the 2020 Programme for Government. The Strategy also plays an important part to achieve the Government's broader commitment to continue to strive for the full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Irish society. The implementation of the Strategy is supported by its partner strategy, <i>the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2021</i>.</p><p>The mission of the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy is that all LGBTI+ young people are visible, valued and included. Three strategic goals were identified to support the achievement of the LGBTI+NYS mission:</p><p><b>- Goal 1:</b>create a safe, supportive and inclusive environment for LGBTI+ young people</p><p><b>- Goal 2:</b>improve the mental, physical and sexual health and wellbeing of the entire LGBTI+ community</p><p><b>- Goal 3:</b>develop research and data environment to better understand the lives of LGBTI+ young people</p><p>These goals cascade down into 15 Objectives and 59 actions, involving collaboration between Government Departments, Agencies and sectors. The Goals are aligned to the five national outcomes of the <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020</i>(BOBF) and governance and implementation of LGBTI+NYS sits within the comprehensive Framework for the implementation of BOBF, as one of its constituent strategies. Implementation of the LGBTI+NYS is supported within the BOBF Framework by the LGBTI+ Youth Forum, which involves young people in implementing the strategy, an annual implementation forum and the appointment of Olivia McEvoy to the Oversight Committee of the BOBF Advisory Council specifically to represent LGBTI+NYS.</p><p>In October 2019 the <i>First Report on the Implementation of the National LGBTI+ Youth Strategy 2018 &ndash; 2020</i>was published, which delineated the implementation of each Goal, Objective and Action up to the 4<sup>th</sup>quarter of 2019. This report, available on the <i>Gov.ie</i>website, shows that, by 2019, 56 of the 59 actions had either already been started (46) or had reported a plan for carrying out the action (10). For the remaining 3 actions, 2 actions had not been reported on and 1 action was under review.</p><p>The actions initiated in the first year of implementation focused on the lives of LGBTI+ young people across a range of sectors, particularly in education, health, and safe and inclusive spaces. Since the publication of the First Implementation Report actions from the Strategy have continued to be implemented across Government and the reporting cycle for 2019 through to the end of the Strategy will begin in the coming months.</p><p>In 2020, my Department continued to implement commitments in the Strategy, and to move forward with cross-Government leadership and coordination of the Strategy. Actions in this year continued to focus on capacity building and ensuring services provision, with an emphasis on rural areas. Due to the Covid pandemic, I extended the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy into 2021 to ensure implementation of all outstanding actions. The current 2021 priority actions for my Department include:</p><p><b>- LGBTI+ Youth Forum</b>: Delivering the work programme of the LGBTI+ Youth Forum to support implementation of the strategy. The youth forum have continued to meet online over the public health emergency and have redrafted plans for a number of actions to take account of Covid restrictions. </p><p><b>- Capacity Building</b>: A new scheme with a focus on Family Support and Youth Service provision at local level was recently launched in partnership with Tusla. </p><p><b>- LGBTI+ Youth Leadership Programme</b>: The LGBTI+ Youth Leadership Programme was announced in early March 2021, to be delivered by For&oacute;ige in collaboration with BeLonG To, and participants have now been recruited. Due to the high level of applications to participate in this programme the Department have accommodated extra places for young people.</p><p><b>- Live Out Loud: Celebrating LGBTI+ Youth</b>: Plans for a biennial national event to publically celebrate LGBTI+ young people have been reconfigured to accommodate public health restrictions. These plans were developed by the LGBTI+ Youth Forum. An online celebration campaign, Live Out Loud, was launched in October 2020 to culminate in a finale event to coincide with Pride 2021. Submissions from LGBTI+ young people, as well as youth, cultural, educational and sports bodies show how LGBTI+ young people are visible, valued and included across culture, society and sport.</p><p><b>- LGBTI+ Welcome Sticker</b>: The roll-out of the LGBTI+ Welcome Sticker as part of the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2021 is being reconfigured to accommodate Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p><b>- LGBTI+ Youth in Ireland and across Europe: A two-phased Landscape and Research Gap Analysis</b>was commissioned from researchers in the Health Promotion Research Centre in NUIG. The report on this research has been peer reviewed and will be published in the coming months. A policy seminars will be held to complete an LGBTI+ research needs analysis based on the research gaps identified.</p><p>In the later part of 2021 I intend to publish a Final Report on implementation of the strategy.</p></reply>

This fund will continue and details of the 2021 programme will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

Existing off-the-job training facilities, particularly in Electrical and Plumbing apprenticeships had been coming under increasing pressure to facilitate the rapid growth in apprentice population.

While many of the provisions of the Act have been commenced, a number of Sections have yet to be. These are Sections 9, 14, 23, 25 to 33, and 38.  </p>  <p>  A considerable amount of preparatory work is required to facilitate the full implementation of the remaining Sections of the Act and it is my Department&rsquo;s intention that substantial progress will be made on advancing this work in 2021.  My Department is actively working with Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) to put in place, on a sustainable basis, the necessary resources that are required to implement these new statutory functions. </p>  <p>  With regard to Section 23 of the Act referred to by the Deputy, the policy intention of this Section is to underpin the statutory basis for all qualifications to be included within the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and to open access to the NFQ for a wider range of awarding bodies than it has pertained to, to date. An important provision under Section 23 will be the establishment of a new class of awarding body, to be known as a Listed Awarding Body, eligible to offer qualifications that are included within the NFQ. </p>  <p>  Many useful qualifications are currently available outside of the NFQ, including qualifications offered by professional, sectoral and international bodies.  It is the intention that in the future such bodies will be able to seek, on a voluntary basis, regulated access to the NFQ. The opening up of the NFQ to a broader range of qualifications is a commitment in our National Skills Strategy, it is consistent with best practice internationally, and is a policy direction supported under EU ambition for a European Education Area and the delivery of the European Skills Agenda.  </p>  <p>  In order for this Section of the legislation to be commenced it will be necessary for QQI in the first instance to develop the policies and criteria for Listed Awarding Bodies and the Inclusion of Awards in the NFQ. This is envisaged by the end of 2021.  This Section of the legislation can then be commenced following QQI's consultation on the relevant policies and criteria.</p></reply>

This ranges from remote or online learning to one day per week in an education institution or periods of off-the-job training (typically from 10-20 weeks) in an education and training institution at further or higher education level.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 60 different apprenticeships leading to qualifications at level 5-10 on the National Framework of Qualifications, with over 7,000 employers employing almost 20,000 apprentices. Apprentice employers are formally approved by SOLAS in advance of employing apprentices.</p>  <p>  Many academic and vocational courses across the further and higher education and training sector also incorporate work placements, however these learners are not employees for the full duration of their course.  </p>  <p>  To find an apprenticeship, prospective apprentices can search apprenticeship vacancies on www.apprenticejobs.ie. Almost 1,000 employers have registered with www.apprenticejobs.ie which is designed to increase visibility of opportunities for all potential apprentices.  For some apprenticeships, the apprenticeship consortia may run a centralised campaign for access to the apprenticeship.  Work to progress towards a single portal through which learners can apply to further or higher education is at an early stage and it is envisaged that this portal will also provide increased visibility of apprenticeship and ETB provision.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship is in development to cover the period 2021-2025.  The plan will target 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025. It will set out a strategy for the coming five year period which will deliver an apprenticeship system which is flexible and responsive, providing a strong value proposition for employers and apprentices, is attractive and easy to engage with, and delivers high standards and sought after qualifications. Achieving this objective will include providing financial and non-financial supports to employers to support participation in apprenticeship and will also include increasing the visibility of apprenticeship job vacancies through centralised advertisement.</p></reply>

For instance, the HEA has supported the national, sectoral and local roll out of online consent training and online bystander intervention training, as well as the development of a national Anonymous Reporting Tool for issues of bullying, harassment, and sexual harassment. As part of monitoring requirements, the HEA requires that institutions report progress on implementation of the Framework for Consent.</p><p>In order to create a robust evidence base for further policy decisions in relation to tackling sexual violence and harassment in HEIs, the HEA is working with stakeholders to develop and commission standardised national surveys of staff and students to monitor their experiences.

Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with sectoral representatives to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Skills, I am committed to continuing the process of investing in our higher education system and to the development and implementation of a sustainable funding model for the sector.</p>  <p>  In terms of Government funding the immediate matter to consider is the impact of COVID 19 on delivery and on students. In 2020 the Government provided funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education for the 20/21 academic year. </p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 20/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution. </p>  <p>  This builds on the additional supports announced in 2020 including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education and an additional &euro;3m provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives.</p>  <p>  In 2021, in line with the two distinct policy goals that will need to be addressed in budgetary decisions over the medium term, additional funding had been provided for the core budgetary programmes and funding for Covid-19 related policy responses. Exclusive of research provision the total planned Departmental and NTF funding of the HE sector for 2021 is in the order of &euro;1.98billion.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the development of a sustainable funding model for higher education is essential in light of the centrality of higher education to our progress as a country.  The future development of Ireland as an inclusive society and a knowledge economy, against the backdrop of rapid technological change, will be critically dependant on the quality of our graduates. In that context, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is underway supported under the European Commission DG Reform Programme.   </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the European Commission and the independently appointed consortia of consultants.  The key aim of this review is to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, including an examination of the funding options. This review commenced in early 2020 and work is expected to be complete towards the latter part of Q2 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with stakeholders on this comprehensive analysis of funding options for higher education and the assessment of the appropriate balance in provision across the tertiary education system. Completion of this work will allow for an informed debate on the appropriate policy approach to future planning and funding of higher and further education provision which is fundamental to Ireland's economic and social sustainability.</p>  <p>  Specific issues comprehended in the USI Education for All Campaign will continue to be considered by the Department and, where appropriate inform ongoing engagement with relevant stakeholders in higher education and against the backdrop of significant cumulative pressures on the public finances at this time.</p></reply>

In line with the Programme for Government commitment to address the gap in postgraduate grants, from September 2021 the postgraduate fee grant will increase from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and will give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition, the fee grant income threshold will increase from &euro;31,500 to o &euro;54,240 from September 2021.</p>  <p>  Postgraduate students who meet all of the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915; the income threshold for this grant for the 2020/21 academic year is &euro;24,500. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. </p>  <p>  Under the Student Grant Scheme 2020, a student in receipt of a postgraduate research award where the stipend portion of the award does not exceed &euro;16,000 may apply to the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) for financial assistance under the Student Grant Scheme 2020. The stipend portion to be disregarded will increase to &euro;18,500 under the Student Grant Scheme 2021.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. My Department will oversee the implementation of the review through a steering group with student representation as well as representation from SUSI. The review of the Student Grant Scheme has commenced and is due to report in Summer 2021. Stakeholders are being consulted as part of the review process and it is intended that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the review. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware that in July I announced a funding package of &euro;168m for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  I recently announced enhanced funding of &euro;3.2 million for the Irish Research Council to better support postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers in Ireland across all disciplines. This will directly benefit close to 1,300 early-career researchers across our higher education and research system. The additional investment will fulfill the long-standing priority attached by the Council to improving the support for its funded postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers at the earliest opportunity. The Irish Research Council&rsquo;s postgraduate stipend will increase from &euro;16,000 to &euro;18,500 per annum and funding for its postdoctoral researchers is also increasing. The changes will benefit both existing and new Council awardees in 2021, effective from the beginning of January.  Since my appointment, the funding gap for postgraduate students and post-doctoral researchers between the research funding agencies under my Department has been an issue I wanted to address. I am pleased I have been able to address this as part of Budget 2021.  </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

I am aware of the important contribution made by this sector and of the challenges that are being encountered given the substantial impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on students, teachers and providers.</p><p>As part of the response to the pandemic, my Department established a specific Working Group for this sector. This group is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments and sectoral representatives of staff, students and providers. </p><p>As part of this process, the representative bodies for English language education providers have engaged with the Working Group surrounding their proposals for supports to aid the recovery of this sector. In this forum, the providers have been advised of the measures introduced by Government, as part of the wider Covid-19 response, to support businesses at this time. These measures included the temporary wages subsidy scheme (TWSS) to facilitate employers to keep employees on the payroll during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to retain this link for when business increases after the crisis. This temporary scheme was kept in place until the end of August 2020. Following the conclusion of the TWSS, it has been superseded by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which continues to provide payroll support to businesses. In addition to the subsidy that is being provided via the EWSS, this scheme also provides for a reduction in Employers PRSI. </p><p>Further to the above, the ELE provider representatives have been advised of the eligibility of businesses in this sector to apply, where appropriate, for further business supports made available by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment via Enterprise Ireland and through its network of Local Enterprise Offices. A full list of these supports and related information is available for providers here: .  </p><p>My Department is continuing to engage with ELE provider representatives as this sector moves towards its full re-opening and continues on a path to recovery.</p></reply>

In the early phase when on-site activities were suddenly suspended this was achieved through a rapid shift to emergency remote learning. Over time a blended model of learning has become the dominant mode with varying levels of onsite and online delivery aligned to public health advice and to the needs of different disciplines and different learner cohorts.</p>  <p>  The Level 5 measures designate higher and further education as essential insofar as onsite presence is required for education activities that cannot be held remotely. In January 2021, the sector rapidly adjusted again by moving the vast majority of their provision online.  </p>  <p>  COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead (published February 23rd) has not changed the status of Level 5 measures for adult and further and higher education. Using COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead and the Level 5 measures as a guide, higher and further education remains primarily online. Institutions and providers continue to carefully balance necessary onsite activities with prevailing public health advice, accepting that levels of time critical activity will fluctuate as the academic year and programmes progress.  </p>  <p>  Issues for the sector remain due to the timing, duration and intensity of COVID 19 restrictions and are leading to some gaps in time critical aspects of programmes such as work placement, work based learning and practical skills essential for successful programme learning outcomes.  The window to return to onsite delivery is narrowing for the current academic year.  </p>  <p>  There has been a risk of growing gaps in learning outcomes and therefore non-completion due to a lack of access to onsite learning and experience.  The effects presented for a wide range of disciplines and were especially acute for some specific programmes and disciplines such as apprenticeship, healthcare, social care, teaching and STEM subjects. </p>  <p>  Recently there have been significant developments in securing marginal increases in on site time critical activity to address key learning requirements at this stage of the academic year, whilst remaining in line with public health advice and the Roadmap, with the vast majority of provision staying online.  Sectoral stakeholder engagement fora have worked responsively to develop flexible approaches for learners to complete their programmes, including the achievement of practical and time critical learning outcomes onsite.   </p>  <p>  As a result of the mitigating actions that have been deployed, in recent weeks the sectors have become more confident that they will be able to achieve all programme learning outcomes this year.

In 2020, I secured a comprehensive package of financial supports for the Higher Education and Further Education and Training sector to mitigate against the direct financial impact of Covid-19. This package included funding of &euro;3m to underpin wellbeing and mental health and student services in our higher education institutions (HEIs), and was in addition to the &euro;2m that was allocated in Budget 2020. </p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority (HEA) advised the HEIs in 2020 of this funding allocation, including a request that institutions distribute it in support of specific student facing areas such as the recruitment of additional Student Counsellors, and implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, which I launched last year. This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. It recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support and respond through working proactively to maximise mental health and wellbeing. The Framework provides clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties. </p>  <p>  The HEA continually monitors the way the financial supports operate within the institutions. In institutional progress reports, institutions have reported that the funding has supported the recruitment of student counsellors, and has enabled support of additional roles, such as Assistant Psychologists and Mental Health Advisors. Funding is also assisting with extending available hours of service and has supported an agility within the HEIs in their collective responses to the challenges created by the ongoing pandemic among the student cohort. Increased capacity has created significant activity in outreach to students, including</p>  <p>  - online support groups (anxiety support, mood management);</p>  <p>  - open, drop in groups to support connection/reduce isolation and loneliness;</p>  <p>  - groups specifically targeting international students, 1st year students and postgraduates;</p>  <p>  - workshops on resilience; managing fear/anxiety/uncertainty; grief and loss during the pandemic; motivation/staying engaged with college;</p>  <p>  - increased responsiveness from counselling services, with many providing same day Wellbeing Calls or brief consultation calls, to respond to students quickly and provide "right time" care;</p>  <p>  - delivery of institution wide staff training in identifying, responding to, and referring, distressed students.</p></reply>

SFI does not have sight of the number of applications made by candidates to Higher Education Institutions for PhD positions.</p><p>SFI monitors the number of PhD students funded through SFI awards by taking an annual snapshot of the number of PhDs involved in active SFI awards.  The available data for this snapshot is below.  This is the most stable indication of the level of Phds funded through SFI awards at any given time.  While figures are not yet available for 2020, the latest figures are as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PhDs active on SFI awards* </td>       <td>1159 </td>       <td>1316 </td>       <td>1331 </td>       <td>1471 </td>       <td>1715 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*As reported by SFI funded researchers in the annual SFI Research Outputs survey. The usual duration of a PhD qualification is 4 years. Therefore, the above figure can be thought of as a 4-year running total of PhDs funded by SFI. </p><p>A significant development to the postdoctoral training landscape in recent years has been the formation of the six new SFI Centres for Research Training which were established in 2019 to provide for Ireland&rsquo;s future skills requirements by training 700 PhD students in digital, data and ICT skills. Collaborations involve 11 Higher Education Institutions and 90 industry partners coming together to develop innovation training programmes in the important fields of data analytics and its application to business, health, agriculture and many other sectors.

Existing off-the-job training facilities, particularly in Electrical and Plumbing apprenticeships, had been coming under increasing pressure to facilitate the rapid growth in apprentice population. COVID-19 related suspension of practical training in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities have had a significant impact on waiting times. When permissible, practical training is also operating at approximately 50% normal capacity to ensure adherence to public health guidance.</p>  <p>  Face to face training was suspended on the 11th January, 2021.

Where craft apprentices have been prioritised to return to face to face training, there is a focus on revision of the theoretical concepts and application of this learning to the practical elements of the course. This provides apprentices with the support required to complete and pass their practical assessments at the first attempt. </p>  <p>  &euro;20M in capital expenditure has been allocated to SOLAS and the HEA to facilitate an additional 4,000 places across the system in the coming period to help address the existing backlogs and to ensure that the system is appropriately positioned to support the expected numbers of registrations into the future.</p></reply>

The role of my Department is limited to the processing of certificates of fitness for applicants for such licences. There is no current legislation with regard to online video gaming engaged in by individuals. However, I am aware that there has been some attention on issues arising in the context of video gaming. In particular, whether in-game purchases or micro-transactions, described as "loot boxes", "skins" etc., designed to improve the players&rsquo; chances of success in inter-active online games, might encourage gambling like behaviour. </p>  <p>  Ireland supported the 2018 Declaration by the Gaming Regulators European Forum that video gaming products should be licensed and regulated appropriately, if they can be shown to fall into the category of gambling. In preparing the declaration, member states were aware of reports that third party actors, not authorised by the video game developer or under their control, may seek to commercialise certain elements of video gaming in a manner akin to gambling. The issue is whether such micro-transactions constitute gambling or are a form of e-commerce.  It is not clear that these offers fall within the current Irish legal definition of gambling or that purchases are essentially an e-commerce activity. </p>  <p>  With regard to protection of children and age limits for video games, the Pan-European Game Information (PEGI) age rating system was established in 2003 to help European parents make informed decisions on buying computer games. It replaced a number of national age rating systems with a single system now used throughout most of Europe, in more than 35 countries including Ireland. However, &lsquo;gambling&rsquo;, for the purposes of PEGI video game rating, is based on whether there are depictions of gambling in the game that can be found in real life, e.g. casino type games. It is not clear that PEGI (which is a voluntary code of the industry, rather than state mandated) could or would put such gambling related warnings on games containing Loot Boxes as these are discretionary purchases by the player. I encourage parents to ensure that their children only engage in appropriate gaming and are not making purchases unknown to them.</p>  <p>  Different approaches have been adopted to the issue of whether and how "loot boxes" might be defined and regulated in the context of gambling activities in Europe, with no definitive outcomes.

This contract, prepared by a solicitor practising in the State on behalf of the employer, is submitted in the first instance to the Central Depository administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and thereafter an application is made to the Immigration Service of my Department for an immigration permission. </p>  <p>  Applicants under the AWS for non-EEA crew in the Irish Fishing Fleet can also make a request to change to a different employer licensed under the Scheme at any time during their permission.

However, the Deputy should be aware that I have no jurisdiction to grant international protection to people located in camps on the Greek islands. That is solely a matter for the Greek authorities.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, in October 2020, Ireland agreed to accept 50 persons, in family groups, who had been granted international protection in Greece and who had been displaced from the Moira camp on the island of Lesbos following the fire that destroyed the Camp.  These families are to be admitted to Ireland as part of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), which is now under the remit of my colleague, Minister O'Gorman. That pledge was in addition to the commitment that Ireland had already made with the UNHCR to resettle 2,900 refugees to Ireland, mainly from Jordan and Lebanon, between 2020 and 2023. </p>  <p>  I understand from Minister O'Gorman that families have been accepted by Ireland, subject to any assessment, security or otherwise to be undertaken. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is working with the Greek authorities and other relevant stakeholders to organise their relocation to Ireland as soon as possible, with due regard to Covid-19 protocols and restrictions.</p></reply>

This includes the administration of the PULSE system. As Minister I have no role in these operational matters. </p>  <p>  I have requested a report on the information required by the Deputy and have been advised by the Garda authorities that in relation to the information requested, it is not possible to provide an answer.</p>  <p>  To obtain the information requested would require a significant effort to examine individual homicide incidents (which include a number of incident types) in order to determine which involved the use of a knife, which would represent a significant expenditure of Garda time and resources. </p>  <p>  I have been advised that this is due to the recording of cases involving the use of knives on PULSE, including cases where there was possession of a knife, but it was used to threaten rather than injure.  It would not therefore be possible to rely on this information alone to identify where the death occurred as a result of injuries sustained from a knife.  Certain information may also only be recorded in investigation files and not within the PULSE narrative, which would not be captured in a search described above of PULSE.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, as has been noted by the Policing Authority, whilst progress has been made on work arising from the Homicide Investigation Review Team (HIRT), this remains on-going in relation to changes to investigative policies and procedures.  The work of the HIRT covered some but not all of the years included in the query and this would affect the comparability of the data over the time period requested.</p></reply>

The increase may also be partly attributed to the increase in frontline resources due to additional recruitment and redeployment of members following the reopening of the Garda College.</p><p>More recently, the increases in seizures are also due to proactive policing operations, particularly during 2020, with the increased Garda presence in support of the COVID-19 public health measures.  There was a 4.7% increase in the number of knives seized between 2019 and 2020 (2,142 in 2019 and 2,243 in 2020).  There was also a substantial year-on-year increase in the number of searches conducted in 2020 &ndash; many of which were associated with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s high visibility operations supporting the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated Garda operations (such as Operation Fanacht). </p><p>For the Deputy's information, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published a report on their website with further analysis of the data above, available at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>In addition, it should be noted that according to HSE data there has been a gradual reduction in people who have been kept in overnight for injuries where they have been assaulted by a knife from the period of 2006 to 2011, where there was on average 243 incidents annually, to an average of 178 incidents per annum between 2015 and 2019.</p></reply>

The level of threat is kept under constant and active review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  With regard to the threat from paramilitary groups, including the so-called &lsquo;dissident&rsquo; groups, while the threat of attack from these groups in the State is generally considered to be low, they nonetheless remain very active here to support  attacks in Northern Ireland. Therefore Garda activities to disrupt and prevent actions by these groups continue without cease. </p>  <p>  The Garda&iacute; also maintain a high level of ongoing, close co-operation with the PSNI and relevant security services in managing this threat.  This operational relationship is central to bearing down on and disrupting the activities of these groups and, therefore, to maintaining security on the island.  My officials also maintain ongoing contact with their UK and Northern Ireland counterparts on a regular basis on this and a range of other issues.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of successful joint operations between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and this work is a testament to the perseverance of the services in seeking to combat terrorist activity on the Island.</p>  <p>  With regard to the request for statistics setting out the annual number of convictions tied to dissident paramilitary activity, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to provide such statistics.  There are inextricable links between the paramilitary groups and organised crime to the point that in some respects it can be difficult to separate them entirely, and it is thus not possible to definitively identify convictions associated with dissident paramilitary activity. </p>  <p>  The Offences Against the State Acts are Ireland&rsquo;s primary counter-terrorism legislation and statistics are publicly available with regard to these Acts. The Courts Service Annual Report provides statistics, including details of proceedings before the Special Criminal Court under the Offences Against the State Act. It must however be noted that prosecutions under that legislation are not solely  concerned with dissident paramilitary activity.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that information relating to certain provisions of the Offences Against the State Act is laid before the Houses annually as part of the renewal process for these sections. This information is contained in the Report on the Operation of Sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, pursuant to Section 18(3) of that Act, and it is publicly available in the Oireachtas library. The most recent report provides data from the year 2000 to 31 May 2020.</p>  <p>  In terms of recent political engagement, I can inform the Deputy that I had a meeting with the UK Home Secretary Priti Patel last month on a range of issues, including law enforcement cooperation and security matters.   I also met last year with Minister James Brokenshire, Minister of State at the UK Home Office with responsibility for Security.  I have had several meetings to date with the Minister for Justice Naomi Long, which involved discussions on security and police cooperation matters and our Departments also jointly hosted the 18th Cross Border Organised Crime conference, which was held virtually last December.</p></reply>

This would require enactment of new legislation to increase the cap on judicial numbers, and is currently under consideration in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.    </p>  <p>  In considering increasing the number of additional judges a number of factors are taken into account including the demands across the various courts, the impact on the overall justice system, the current workload and work methods, and the costs arising, including the ancillary staff that each additional judge requires.  </p>  <p>  Meanwhile, any judicial vacancies that arise in the courts continue to be filled in a timely manner. There are currently no vacancies in the High Court.</p>  <p>  A working group is currently being established, in line with an action of my Justice Plan 2021, to progress a Programme for Government commitment to consider the number and type of judges required over the next few years.  The necessary preparatory work is well under way, including sourcing an appropriate research project to provide the necessary evidence base for deliberations.  This work is expected to be finalised shortly, and I will bring proposals to Government in April.  The research and planning work will be an important opportunity for the judiciary and other stakeholders to inform and contribute to the development of an evidence base for ensuring that the right number of judges, with the right skills can be deployed in the right manner in future, to benefit all citizens seeking timely access to justice.</p></reply>

The projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime or anti-social behaviour and to support wider preventative work within the community and with families at risk. </p>  <p>  I understand that considerable progress has been made in the last number of years to extend the Garda Youth Diversion Project network to ensure that the service is available throughout the State.  This work is ongoing and, to date, has been achieved by extending the catchment areas of existing projects and by allocating additional staff.  </p>  <p>  Currently there are a very small number of areas where this approach would not be suitable and these are instead being considered for the establishment of new projects.  I am informed that the number of areas in the State in which the evidence warrants the establishment of a new project, rather than the strengthening or extension of a catchment area, is less than 15. </p>  <p>  Catchment areas for projects are determined in consultation with local community groups, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other stakeholders on a case-by-case basis. As the GYDPs have evolved organically since their inception, catchment areas can vary depending on the project&rsquo;s background and local needs.  </p>  <p>  It may also be noted that, in recent years, the GYDP model has been developed and extended, with a renewed emphasis on family support and early intervention/preventative work, as well as on working with harder-to-engage young people, including those not suitable for the Garda Diversion Programme.  Where any new projects are being established, the minimum core of the project will now include 2 youth justice workers, a family support worker, an early intervention support worker and an outreach worker to engage with harder-to-reach young people. </p>  <p>  The estimated cost in a full year for a new project with all the additional elements under this draft revised model will depend on local circumstances.  For comparison, funding of existing projects is some &euro;125,000 on average. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice will shortly publish the new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 which will see a considerable strengthening of the role GYDPs and our other community-based youth justice interventions. </p></reply>

Furthermore, the scheduling of individual court cases and the allocation of court business are entirely matters for the Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judges who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has advised me that they continue to work with the Judiciary to prioritise business and the holding of courts to address areas of concern. As part of this overall approach, I am informed that the President of the Circuit Court has issued a number of practice directions in relation to Circuit Court proceedings, the most recent on 12 February 2021, which can be viewed on the Courts Service website at: www.courts.ie.</p>  <p>  The Courts have continued to sit on priority matters in the areas of family law, criminal matters, bail and urgent injunctions. Prior to the latest imposition of Level 5 restrictions, additional capacity was added by the Courts Service to the courts infrastructure to facilitate the holding of numbers of courts close to pre-Covid levels. While every effort has been made to facilitate as much court business as possible, backlogs have accrued in certain case categories.</p>  <p>  The Judiciary and the Courts Service have worked closely and innovated through the use of technology to maintain the highest level of court activity possible, including remote courts being conducted. The Courts Service is currently rolling out videolink facilities to 43 additional courtrooms across the country this year, in addition to the investments made last year, in order to assist in addressing the current caseload and reducing backlogs. </p>  <p>  Through staggering of court lists, positive callovers of cases on hand and the introduction of new people management procedures, the Courts began to operate at near full capacity in the Summer and Autumn of last year and good progress had been made in dealing with arrears that built up during restrictions. The Courts Service expects similar results will be possible once current restrictions ease and continues to work closely with the Judiciary to identify areas of work that require particular attention. Work is on-going to manage day to day issues and to plan for reopening, including regular engagement with key stakeholders such as the legal profession.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring adequate resources for the courts in order to maintain access to justice for all citizens, which was reinforced in 2020 with the highest ever budgetary allocation for the Justice sector including &euro;158.8 million for the Courts Service. Preparation of a Justice Sector Plan for recovery, which will consider the impact of Covid in terms of backlogs, pent-up and unmet demand, and the interdependencies across the sector, is currently being prepared by my Department and its agencies, including the Court Service.</p></reply>

This includes the provision of information on the courts system. </p><p>To be of assistance, I made enquiries with the Courts Service, who have informed me that statistics relevant to information on rape trials is set out in the Courts Service Annual Reports which are published on the Courts Service website. </p><p>The following information on rape trials is taken from statistics published in the Courts Service Annual Reports of 2016, 2017 and 2018. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number of offences that went to trial</th>       <th>Convictions</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>279</td>       <td>135</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>536</td>       <td>241</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>419</td>       <td>194</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further informed that information relevant to that sought by the Deputy on sexual assault offences, insofar as they are available, are set out in the Courts Service Annual Reports which are published on the Courts Service website and are available on -  </p><p>In addition, there have been 24 convictions in relation to sexual offences in the years 2016-2018 that were appealed on the grounds of leniency.

Supporting a Victims Journey</i>is a detailed roadmap, which when implemented, will ensure we have a more victim-centred system that supports and empowers victims and gives them the confidence to engage with all services knowing they will be supported, informed and treated with respect and dignity at every point and by every person they come into contact with.</p></reply>

Staff in the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department are trained in this regard and are supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required. Moving to a distributed ceremonies format would require Citizenship staff having to attend at various events across the country and would likely result in a loss of productivity to the detriment of applicants. </p><p>A number of County Councils have previously requested and supported smaller ceremonies taking place within their administrative areas. Most recently, Waterford City hosted a ceremony in 2019, to mark the first flying of the tricolour in Waterford City in 1848. Further details of that ceremony can be found on our website at: . </p><p>Citizenship processes are currently undergoing review in my Department. Any proposal to co-host citizenship ceremonies with a local authority will be considered as part of this process. </p><p>Currently, the Covid 19 pandemic has prevented the holding of in-person ceremonies, however it remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. Since their establishment in 2011, citizenship ceremonies have been joyous occasions which mark the granting of Irish citizenships in a dignified manner and they have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured.</p><p>On 18 January 2021, I was pleased to announce a temporary system that enables citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. </p><p>This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. The Citizenship Division of my Department is communicating with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis. </p><p>Under the temporary new system, up to 4,000 qualifying applicants are currently being asked to complete a statutory declaration that is sent to them by email from the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department and bring it to one of the listed designated officials. The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division. Final processing will then take place and a certificate of naturalisation, will be sent to the applicant.</p><p>My Department expects to continue the current statutory declaration process beyond March and we are aiming to have communicated with an additional 2,500 applicants in the system by the end of June. </p><p>To date, 3,615 communications have issued and 1,605 declarations had been returned and  887 certificates of naturalisation have already issued and more will issue in the coming weeks once the final processing of the returned declarations is completed.</p></reply>

Following the end of the Brexit transition period, the Dublin Regulation no longer applies to the return of applicants for international protection who have come from the UK to Ireland. </p><p>Following the United Kingdom&rsquo;s exit from the EU, the International Protection Act 2015 (Safe Third Country) Order 2020, came into effect from 11pm on 31 December 2020. The Order designates the UK as a safe third country for the purpose of the International Protection Act 2015. The amendment enables a determination that an application for international protection is inadmissible where the person has arrived in the State from the UK and where the relevant criteria are met. Such inadmissible applicants are returned to the UK under a more simplified returns process that mirrors the EU Dublin process.</p><p>There are no plans at present to discontinue this procedure.  As far as I am aware, the United Kingdom has not, at this stage, introduced any changes to their immigration or asylum systems.  Following the publication of their Policy Statement &lsquo;New Plan for Immigration&rsquo; on 24 March 2021, I understand that the UK has initiated a comprehensive consultation and engagement process on the document prior to introducing any changes.

Further, the allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demands.  This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.</p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. Indeed, this has never been more evident than in the work carried out by all members of the Garda&iacute; as we have tackled the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the table below, which has been provided to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the 'R' District or Coolock District at 28 February 2019, 29 February 2020 and 28 February 2021.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Coolock District </th>       <th>Garda</th>       <th>Sergeant</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>28 February 2019</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>29 February 2020</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>28 February 2021</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further advised that Garda Members attached to Community Policing Units were temporarily re-assigned to the Regular units at the commencement of the new roster introduced as part of the response by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to Covid-19. This explains the decrease for February 2021. I am assured by the Garda authorities that members from the Community Policing Unit remain in contact with their contacts throughout the community, and have been providing valuable assistance to vulnerable persons throughout the crisis. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Coolock District forms part of the DMR North Division, I can inform the Deputy that at 28 February 2021, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 44 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the DMR North Division. This represents an increase of over 69% since December 2020 when there were 26 Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division. </p><p>Detailed information in relation to Community Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

Judges are available to deal with urgent matters when required and have, in circumstances where it is possible to use technology and the Court feels it is appropriate, dealt with matters remotely.

This work is an important part of our plan to build a justice system that works for everyone. I expect to receive the report of the study in the coming weeks and will subsequently publish it.</p>  <p>  This independent study commissioned by my Department is looking at international best practice in the conduct of domestic homicide reviews with a view to making recommendations in relation to their application in this jurisdiction. The study will be a key facet in delivering on this commitment.</p>  <p>  Ms Maura Butler, who is a solicitor and has been a member of the Study&rsquo;s Advisory Group since its establishment, agreed to take responsibility for leading completion of the study, following the sad and untimely death of Norah Gibbons, who was previously responsible. I would emphasise the importance of recognising that the Advisory Group and their work is independent, and my Department is not involved in the work of the study nor is it a member of the Advisory Group.</p>  <p>  I look forward to examining the report in detail and I will consider any recommendations made as a priority.</p></reply>

It commits to placing victims at the centre of our criminal justice system and working to remove the fear that many victims have of coming forward to report what happened to them.</p><p>The Justice Plan 2021 has a number of actions to advance this goal, including the one the Deputy mentions, through the implementation of <i>Supporting a Victims Journey.  Supporting a Victims Journey</i>is a detailed roadmap, which, when implemented, will ensure we have a more victim-centred system that supports and empowers victims and gives them the confidence to engage with all services knowing they will be supported, informed and treated with respect and dignity at every point and by every person they come into contact with.</p><p>The mapping exercise that that Deputy refers to, objective 133 in the 2021 Justice Action Plan, is indicative of our commitment to working in partnership with organisations that support victims of crime to ensure the victim&rsquo;s perspective and voice is at the heart of what we do.  Crucially important physical and emotional supports and services are provided by NGOs and the reform and development of these services is being progressed in a spirit of co-design between the State as funder and the voluntary sector as provider.</p><p>We have reviewed our grant schemes for organisations working with victims of crime.  We asked each NGO to identify the precise categories of victims they work with, the services they provide and the geographical areas they work in.  The funding available increased from some &euro;2m in 2020 to some &euro;4m this year.  We have allocated most of the 2021 grant monies, but are still analysing the data to see where gaps remain so we can work to fill those.  We are also offering multi-annual funding commitments to those NGOs we work most closely with and where the funding covers staff salaries &ndash; in the interest of promoting more sustainable service delivery and planning.  These grants cover court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, emotional support, counselling and referral to other services.</p><p>We are also working with our NGO partners and others to map the journey faced by individual victims to identify issues and support needs not met.  The working group leading on this task has met and the NGOs have presented us with a considerable amount of data, which is currently being analysed.  When this analysis is complete, the group will reconvene to identify and agree actions to be taken to meet those needs.</p><p>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the timeline for this work, it will be published as soon as practicable but I can confirm it is on target to be completed by the end of Q2 2021, as stated in Justice Plan 2021. I am deeply committed to implementing in full all of the recommendations set out in <i>Supporting a Victims Journey</i>and am chairing an Implementation Oversight Group comprising all relevant Departments and Agencies responsible for driving the implementation of the agreed actions.</p></reply>

In this process the Group also looked at the impact of tort legislation on the overall patient safety culture and open disclosure. Judge Meenan submitted the final report of the Expert Group on the Reform of the Law of Torts and the Current System for Managing Clinical Negligence Claims to my myself and the Minister of Justice in January 2020, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from, the social and medical impacts of an illness.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, I also recognise that patients require a responsive and compassionate health system to meet their medical needs, particularly in cases of terminal illness. I am therefore pleased to confirm that the Government recently agreed to introduce an administrative arrangement for up to 12 months on an interim basis, that will enable persons who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less, to be awarded a medical card. These applications will not require a means assessment nor will they be reassessed.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years.</p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of providing a medical card in the manner sought, this information is not readily available at this time.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that publication of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive and far-reaching piece of legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a wide range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; domestic surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research.  The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  Overall, the provisions outlined within the Bill will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight.  The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR is the key principle underpinning all legislative measures in this area.</p></reply>

Given the scale of the functions being transferred and the significant budget involved (c. &euro;2.2bn in 2021), there are multiple financial, HR, policy, legal and governance workstreams underway within my Department to sequence the range of tasks necessary to effectively complete the transfer of responsibility between both Departments.</p>  <p>Since the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement in June 2020, both Departments have worked together to provide effective oversight and co-ordination of the various tasks involved in the transfer of policy and budgetary responsibility. While significant progress has already been made in advancing the transfer, work to-date has emphasised the complexity and interconnected nature of the service and financial arrangements currently in place. Due to the complex nature of these current arrangements, it will be necessary to draft and enact primary legislation to establish the arrangements for the new Department in a legally robust manner. To that end, I intend to bring the General Scheme of a Bill to Government in the first half of this year.</p></reply>

In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis. Further details are available at the following link:</p><p>The next cohort to be vaccinated (Cohort 4) are those aged 16-69 and at very high risk of severe illness and death. Vaccination of this group began in March. </p><p>In relation to the categories of very high risk and high risk conditions, this list is not exhaustive. It may also include people who have been classed as at very high risk, based on clinical judgement and an assessment of need. It is recommended that the individuals concerned discuss this with their treating physician who is in the best position to give appropriate advice.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

On 18 September 2020, the NCPE completed its assessment and recommended that Voretigene neparvovec not be considered for reimbursement unless cost effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p><p>The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the applicant company in November 2020.</p><p>The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p><p>The HSE Drugs Group considered Voretigene neparvovec at its February 2021 meeting, and requested Patient and Clinician Engagement input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) regarding reimbursement of Voretigene neparvovec.</p><p>The HSE has advised that, on 23 March 2021, the RDTRC held a meeting to discuss Voretigene neparvovec at which input was provided by a surgeon with expertise in inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). Further input specific to the impact of IRDs was also provided by a patient-advocate member of the RDTRC.</p><p>The HSE has further advised that the RDTRC will meet again in early April in order to finalise a comprehensive response for issue to the HSE Drugs Group, and that the Drugs Group will review the output of the RDTRC as soon as possible, with a view to making a reimbursement recommendation.</p><p>The HSE EMT is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013 and it will, following receipt of the outcome of the HSE Drugs Group's deliberations, make the decision on whether Voretigene neparvovec will be reimbursed.</p></reply>

The advice of the WHO and the ECDC is available on their websites. For example, in its Technical Report &ldquo;Options for the use of rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK&rdquo;, published on 19 November 2020, the ECDC confirmed that &ldquo;To date, testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly relies on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on a nasopharyngeal specimen. This testing method remains the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and is characterised by both high sensitivity and specificity in detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA).&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE has made available antigen detection tests (ADTs) for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have to supplement the use of PCR as part of the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to monitor the evidence for all testing types in conjunction with other public bodies, such as the Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA), and having regard to best international evidence and advice. On an ongoing basis, the National Public Health Emergency Team considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population.

Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP. There is currently no GMS GP vacancy in the locality concerned. </p>  <p>  The Government, aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice, has implemented a number of measures to improve recruitment and retention in general practice. </p>  <p>  These measures include an increase in investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023 under the terms of the 2019 GMS GP Agreement GP. The Agreement provides for increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas, and for improvements to maternity and paternity leave arrangements.  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 214 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021.  The ICGP noted a record number of applications for the 2021 GP training programme.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  On 23 March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met.</p>  <p>  Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p>  <p>  I have also set up a group, chaired by the government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, to examine the use of rapid tests in the community, and I will be considering the recommendations of this group.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population.

In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis. Further details are available at the following link:</p><p>The next cohort to be vaccinated (Cohort 4) are those aged 16-69 and at very high risk of severe illness and death. Vaccination of this group began in March. </p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

Of these, 212 relate to Clinical Care claims brought directly by the service users, the remaining 51 relate to psychological injury claims brought by family members/dependents. In relation to the 263 claims received, 31 have been concluded. </p><p><b>Amount paid out in claims to date</b></p><p>It should be noted that almost all of the claims have been settled by the laboratories involved in the individual claims and, accordingly, the Agency does not, in all instances, have details of settlement payments made by those laboratories. This applies equally to the associated legal costs &ndash; see below. </p><p><b>Legal costs of the cases</b></p><p>In respect of all associated National Screening Services (CervicalCheck) cases, legal costs amounting to &euro;2,832,491 have been paid. These legal costs include fees paid to mediation services, which is consistent with the SCA&rsquo;s policy of using mediation wherever possible to resolve these claims in a non-adversarial manner. These legal fees also include matters not relating to the areas in which the State has already accepted liability. It is anticipated that much of the legal work carried out in respect of these initial cases, and by extension the fees incurred, will be applied in resolving future cases that have been notified to the SCA and that this legal work will not need to be repeated in managing these future cases.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30<sup>th</sup>of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department , following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details are available here:</p><p><i></i></p><p>Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles are being vaccinated in Cohort 2.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>On 23<sup>rd</sup>March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met.</p><p>Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first.</p><p>Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p><p>The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p><p>The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, Inpatient Day Case and Outpatient waiting list data at the end of February for Nenagh Hospital is outlined in the attached document.

The Health Service Executive is leading on the implementation framework in respect of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.</p>  <p>  The Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy Implementation Framework (IF) was launched in February 2019. The overarching aim of the Strategy is the development of neuro-rehabilitation services to improve patient outcomes by providing safe, high quality, person -centred neuro-rehabilitation at the lowest appropriate level of complexity. This must be integrated across the care pathway, and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres where necessary.</p>  <p>  These services should be configured into population based managed clinical rehabilitation networks (MCRNs). The MCRN, while an effective model in a number of European countries, is a new concept in Ireland. MCRNs are recognised as having the potential to bring together an appropriate range of primary, secondary and tertiary services to ensure equitable provision of high quality and clinically effective services.</p>  <p>  Funding has been sought and approved to support the introduction of a managed clinical rehabilitation network demonstrator project. The focus of the demonstrator project is the development of post-acute and community neuro-rehabilitation services across CHO 6 &amp;amp; 7. In terms of service provision, this is where the gap is most evident in terms of demonstrating a Network model.</p>  <p>  Funding became available from Q4 2020, with full year funding of &euro;2.29m available for 2021.The learning from the demonstrator project will inform implementation of the Neuro-rehabilitation Strategy across each CHO and implementation of strategy will roll-out from 2022.</p>  <p>   As the issue raised is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive (HSE)  to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Six APAs have been negotiated by the Commission under this process to date, of which Ireland is participating in five.</p>  <p>  Government approval has been obtained to opt-into a sixth, but this is conditional on certain trial progression criteria being met.</p>  <p>  Ireland has opted-in to pro rata allocation of BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines. Ireland has also secured additional doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine via options and top up contracts, which will bring the current total of BioNTech/Pfizer doses secured to approximately 6.5 million doses. Ireland has also ordered 1.64 million additional doses of the Moderna vaccine. Ireland now expects to receive a total of 1.1 million doses of three of the four approved vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca) from the start of the vaccination programme to the end of March.</p>  <p>   Ireland has signalled its solidarity with the EU approach and has, through its participation, gained access to a broad range of vaccines that it might not otherwise have access to, and at the cost agreed collectively by the EU.</p>  <p>  Four vaccines have been authorised by the EU, and a number of vaccine candidates are still to be fully assessed.  Ireland fully supports efforts by the international community, including as an EU Member State, to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all. If, and when, it is determined that Ireland has an excess of vaccine doses to successfully achieve the goals of the vaccination strategy, Ireland will utilise the sharing mechanisms available through the EU procurement structure. It is expected that COVAX will be central to this sharing mechanism. As significant uncertainty remains around the vaccination environment in Europe, it is too early to quantify or schedule the potential sharing of vaccines.</p></reply>

In regard to 2021, GP e-referrals to Rapid Access Clinics for weeks 2-10 this year stand at 112% of the activity in the corresponding weeks in 2020.</p><p>Medical Oncology services continue in all 26 hospitals and guidance has issued to clinicians regarding the provision of Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT). This includes details on treating cancer patients with Covid-19, or with potential Covid-19. The number of patients receiving chemotherapy up end 2020 was approximately 88% of 2019 levels.</p><p>Radiation oncology services in the public hospitals are currently operating at &amp;gt;90% of 2019 activity levels.  Radiation oncology units are accommodated in buildings that are largely separate from other hospital services, which may reassure patients who are nervous about presenting to hospitals in the current climate.</p><p>Urgent surgical oncology is being prioritised and there is an emphasis on maintaining safe patient pathways for this. Private hospitals have been key to ensuring that time-sensitive surgery continues. Surgery numbers in public hospitals in 2020 were 76% of the 2019 levels (this does not include public case surgeries undertaken in private hospitals). </p><p>Funding of &euro;12m has been allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels. This funding will support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support. It will also support virtual clinics and more accurate triage, and facilitate infrastructure and minor equipment purchases to increase capacity across Rapid Access Clinics and surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology services. </p><p>In addition, as part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year. This funding will facilitate developments across prevention, diagnosis, treatment and patient supports.</p></reply>

Cancer services continue to operate in line with guidance issued by the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP).</p><p>The NCCP is continuing to closely monitor trends in numbers coming forward to diagnostic services, and the level of attendances for appointments for treatment. The NCCP is focused on engaging with cancer services, and with hospital management, in the designated cancer centres (and beyond in the case of medical oncology) with a view to ensuring the continuation of services for cancer patients.</p><p>The number of people coming forward to their GPs, being referred to Cancer Rapid Access Clinics (RACs) and attending these clinics decreased significantly in mid-March to May 2020 due to the fears in regard to Covid, and the reaction of people to restrictions in place at that time.  </p><p>These figures increased over time - the total number of patients seen across all RACs in 2020 (44,233) amounted to 88% of the 2019 figure (50,249) and GP e-referrals to RACs for weeks 2-10 this year stand at 112% of the activity in the corresponding weeks in 2020.</p><p>Medical and radiation and oncology services are continuing, utilising the safeguards of social distancing and infection prevention &amp;amp; control measures built up in the past year.  The number of patients receiving chemotherapy up to end-2020 is at approximately 88% of 2019 activity, while radiation oncology is operating at &amp;gt;90% of 2019 activity. </p><p>BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelScreen resumed their services last year and service continues, albeit at reduced capacity, during the current level 5 restrictions. The focus is on getting services resumed to achieve the maximum screening rates that are compatible with a safe and controlled follow-up treatment capacity in the health service. Throughout the pause in screening and the restart, those who were already scheduled for further assessment or treatment were prioritised, and follow-up clinics continued.</p><p>The safety of screening participants and staff continues to be the highest priority at this time. Safety precautions are in place throughout the National Screening Services to protect against the spread of Covid-19 and screening services have implemented advised safety measures to reduce the risk of infection. I&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to emphasise that screening is for healthy people who do not have symptoms.</p><p>An important message to everyone now is that, if you have any concerns about cancer please go to your GP, who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. Our cancer diagnostic and treatment services are open, and our healthcare staff will provide any necessary care.</p><p>Funding of &euro;12m has been allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels. This funding will support hospitals in addressing backlogs, extending clinic times, providing additional clinics, increasing diagnostic capacity and providing locum/temporary support. It will also support virtual clinics and more accurate triage, and facilitate infrastructure and minor equipment purchases to increase capacity across Rapid Access Clinics and surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology services. </p><p>In addition, as part of Budget 2021, an extra &euro;20m has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year.

I have announced an increase of 120 medical intern posts for July 2021. From July 2021 the national number of available intern posts is 854.  The increase in the number of intern places will be supported with accompanying increases in postgraduate training places, to ensure these doctors can avail of the next step in the training pathway following completion of an internship. </p><p>Over the next number of months, the HSE will be undertaking a formal review of the number of intern posts and postgraduate training positions to ensure the number of intern places are in line with future medical workforce planning requirements of the health service.

It requires the involvement of two medical practitioners, one of whom must be an obstetrician and the other a medical practitioner of a relevant specialty. Both must examine the pregnant woman and both must certify their reasonable opinion, formed in good faith that the termination of pregnancy can be carried out. The termination of pregnancy must then be carried out by the certifying obstetrician, or in cases where the second certifying doctor is also an obstetrician, either one may carry out the procedure. </p><p>The provisions in the 2018 Act reflect the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, published in December 2017.</p><p>The operation of the legislation is a matter for attending clinicians. The appropriate medical body, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Obstetricians based in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, has published Clinical Guidance on Termination of Pregnancy in a number of scenarios, including the <i>Pathway for Management of Fatal Fetal Abnormalities and/or Life-Limiting Conditions Diagnosed During Pregnancy</i>.</p><p>Services for termination of pregnancy under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 have continued to function during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30<sup>th</sup>of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The public health measures recognise the need to reduce congregation and interactions between people to reduce opportunities for the transmission of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo;provides for restrictions on gatherings of people indoors given the higher risk associated with these types of activities. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. </p>  <p>  The Framework sets out when it is considered that religious services can take place with protective measures (Levels 1 and 2) and when they must move online (Levels 3,4 and 5). Weddings and funerals are exceptions and can continue at every level with limited numbers. Churches and other places of worship can remain open for private prayer. It is also important to note that at all levels, Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony. </p>  <p>  I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made by people across the country at this difficult time. That includes the many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19.</p>  <p>  In February, the Taoiseach met with representatives of the Catholic Church to discuss the current level of Covid-19 restrictions and the Church&rsquo;s desire to return to worship, in particular during the season of Lent,  Holy Week and Easter. At that meeting the Taoiseach acknowledged the importance of the Church community in people&rsquo;s lives at this time of stress and worry. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Ireland&rsquo;s epidemiological situation remains uncertain as a number of disease indicators are now static or potentially disimproving. Ireland is still experiencing high levels of infection across the country and the health service remains under pressure. There remains a considerable risk that Ireland will experience a further wave of infection if public health restrictions are eased at the current level of infection and before the vaccine rollout has been significantly advanced.</p>  <p>  The Government reviewed current public health measures on 30 March and agreed that religious services will continue to be held online and that this will be reviewed by 4 May. </p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government. Preliminary work has already been undertaken by NIAC, in the context of Group 9 (people aged 16-64 living or working in crowded settings) listed in the Allocation Strategy, to identify those who meet the criteria of living and/or working in conditions which make social distancing difficult and further consideration will be given to finalising the composition of this cohort in the coming weeks. </p><p>There may be unintended barriers to equal access to the vaccine for minority groups. These barriers could include:</p><p>- difficulties in attending designated vaccination centres</p><p>- lack of contact with and trust in the health services</p><p>- vaccine hesitancy due to a lack of information </p><p>- low levels of health literacy or language barriers.</p><p>Advance preparation including a targeted campaign to ensure socially excluded groups can access the vaccine in accordance with the Vaccination Allocation Strategy will be key to its success. Listening and engaging with socially excluded groups is critical to building confidence in the COVID-19 vaccination programme. This will take time, resources, targeted communications and innovative delivery mechanisms. </p><p>A collaborative approach to roll out the vaccine is required with HSE addiction and inclusion health services, section 39 organisations and service users. To this end the National Social Inclusion office held a National COVID-19 Vaccine Information Web Session for Traveller and Roma service providers on 25 March 2021.</p></reply>

It focuses on providing the right care, in the right place, at the right time, where the patient/service user is paramount and strong emphasis is placed on prevention and public health.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made in implementing this workstream. The development of an interagency multi-annual 5-year plan to integrate all five Capacity-Access workstreams (namely Healthy Living, Enhanced Community Care &amp;amp; Capacity, Enhanced Acute Care &amp;amp; Capacity, Scheduled Care and Unscheduled Care) is underway having been impacted by the re-assignment of key service and clinical staff to COVID-19. This work has now been factored into the development of the National Service Plan 2021 and the Slaintecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023 currently being finalised.The 2021 Budget funding of &euro;1.235 billion provides the opportunity for delivering Sl&aacute;intecare at pace, and is intended to be the first major step towards achieving the appropriate capacity of the health service in terms of both beds and community-based services as set out in the Health Service Capacity Review, 2018.</p>  <p>  Key areas of progress also include the development of the Healthy Ireland (HI) Strategic Action Plan which is currently undergoing review and approvals process. It sets out Healthy Ireland&rsquo;s strategic actions for the next phase of the HI Framework (2021 -2025), aligned with the Programme for Government ambitions. The Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme, an area-based approach to improving health and wellbeing at community level with a particular focus on areas of deprivation, is progressing well, with wide-ranging stakeholder engagement underway and targeted health and wellbeing services identified.  Other elements that have progressed include the publication of healthy eating guidelines for young children and the &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign to support resilience in individuals and communities, in line with the Government plans for COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery, focused on keeping active, staying connected, switching off, eating well and minding your mood, including significant investment of resources to support implementation of a range of initiatives under these themes, in partnership with a wide group of stakeholders. </p>  <p>  An Enhanced Community Care Model including the development of a Community Healthcare Network multidisciplinary model through a learning site approach, Integrated Care Hubs for Older People and People with Chronic Diseases to provide specialist care in a community setting, building on the GP Agreement and the National Clinical Programmes for each of the four major chronic diseases (diabetes, asthma, COPD and heart failure) was also rolled out.</p>  <p>  The value of eHealth, ICT and health information systems was demonstrated throughout the pandemic. Through rapid development and deployment of systems and technology, several thousand staff were set up to work remotely where they could continue to support frontline healthcare workers, telehealth solutions were deployed for GPs and outpatient clinics, paper prescriptions were replaced with electronic copies thus reducing non-essential contact with GPS and practice staff, ICU systems were deployed and upgraded, patient assessment hubs and other Covid facilities were fitted out and connected, the Covid Care Tracker used by  contact tracing teams to record data on patients referred for test was developed and deployed. The Covid Tracker App was developed and became the first such app that worked across borders. Since December, the national covid vaccination system was developed an deployed and mass vaccination sites and other facilities have been connected to the health network and fitted out with kit to support vaccination teams.</p>  <p>  Investment in EHRs continues. Building on the successful deployment of an EHR at St James Hospital in 2018 and Maternity &amp;amp; Newborn EHR systems in our larger Maternity Hospitals, the National Childrens Hospital are in the final stage of selecting their preferred product and the deployment of these complex systems will represent and multi annual exercise in preparation for commissioning of the site. In the meantime the National Forensics Hospital and National Rehabilitation Hospital are deploying EPR systems with other sites taking a more stepwise approach to deploying modular components of EHRs.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Integration/Innovation Fund continued to support initiatives testing and scaling how services can be delivered and that support the delivery of integrated care and the shift to community care in new and innovative ways, helping to reduce and prevent hospital visits.</p>  <p>  Full details of progress made in 2019 can be found in the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan Year-end Report 2019. A report on implementation in 2020 is being finalised and will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  In terms of disability services, HSE Disability Services provide personal and social supports based on the needs of the individual, rather than the provision of services based on a specific diagnosis or condition. Services for people with disabilities include day and respite services, adult day services, residential services. </p>  <p>  The HSE also provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant and Home Support Services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.  PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers. </p>  <p>  Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community-based staff.  Individuals' needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available.  As with every service there is not a limitless resource available for the provision of home support services and while the resources available are substantial, they are finite.  In this context, services are discretionary and the number of hours granted is determined by other support services already provided to the person/family.</p></reply>

The PA provides assistance, at the discretion and direction of the person with the disability, thus promoting choice, and control for the person with the disability to live independently. This may include for example, assisting with personal care, household chores, supporting you during study or work, playing sports, pursuing hobbies, socialising or anything that the PA and service user may agree.</p>  <p>  Personal Assistance Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff. Individuals' needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.</p>  <p>  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available. It is important to note that the level of service delivered is varied to ensure that each client&rsquo;s needs are reflected. Therefore there is no average agreed number of PA hours per person. PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.

This Government&rsquo;s priority is to improve waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment across all specialties, including Scoliosis.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of the deferral of elective scheduled care activity in March, April and May of 2020, and since 2nd January 2021.  </p>  <p>  It is of note that key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as two-metre distancing, have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver all hospital services, including scoliosis procedures, and this has had a significant impact on both available capacity and operational activity levels.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, by 31st December 2020 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) had carried out 322 scoliosis procedures, a decrease in activity of 16% compared with 2019. By the end of February 2021, CHI had carried out a total of 76 scoliosis surgeries, an increase of 18 surgeries (31%) compared to the same period in 2020.</p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that under the current HSE guidelines, they have reduced the number of procedures to urgent and those that are time sensitive. Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that they are working with the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh to expand orthopaedic capacity. This is expected to have a positive impact on orthopaedic long waiting patients, including reductions in waiting times for children with scoliosis. CHI is also running additional orthopaedic clinics in City West, using a new active clinical triage model, which is reducing the number of children waiting the longest for appointments. </p>  <p>  Representatives of CHI, the Orthopaedic Spinal Team and the Advocacy Groups continue to meet as part of the Co-Design framework on a quarterly basis to work on providing solutions for patients in the spinal service.</p></reply>

The Task Force report was published in December 2017 and it was suggested that the time-frame for full implementation should be three years. The report made recommendations in 10 different themed areas. It also identified lead agencies associated with each recommendation to develop and/or implement these as appropriate.</p><p>Since publication of the Task Force report, various recommendations have been incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies. The implementation of these recommendations has been ongoing since publication of the report and many major areas of priority have been delivered. In this regard, there have been several online support projects delivered to support online counselling, online CBT training and online signposting; schools have upskilled staff in mental health training and many disciplines have availed of mental health first aid training; early intervention projects such as perinatal training and family support projects have launched. Health and wellbeing projects have been supported and many NGOs have been supported to deliver local youth-specific mental health initiatives nationally through mental health funding, Sl&aacute;intecare funding and Healthy Ireland community funding. </p><p>An update on the status of each recommendation is included in the attachment.</p><p>Implementation of a small number of recommendations was envisaged through a Pathfinder inter-departmental unit on youth mental health. In addition &rsquo;Sharing the Vision &ndash; a Mental Health Policy for Everyone&rsquo; advocates that access to mental health supports be based on individual need. This means that care plans should consider the needs of the whole individual regardless of age, gender or socio-economic profile. This will ensure that young people&rsquo;s needs remain prioritised over the lifetime of the policy, taking over from where the Youth Mental Health Task Force Report ends.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE are now engaged in implementing Sharing the Vision and are committed to developing new youth mental health initiatives over the ten year lifetime of the policy. </p><p>The proposal to establish a cross-governmental youth mental health Pathfinder unit with participation from the Department of Health, the Department of Education and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth received Ministerial approval during the previous Government.  Its establishment is a priority for me as Minister with special responsibility for mental health and is set out in the current Programme for Government. </p><p>The proposal is to formalise a new model for collaborative working within Government and place a Pathfinder unit on a statutory footing by utilising section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997. This section of the 1997 Act has never been used before. Various administrative, budgetary, governance and legal arrangements need to be developed and agreed to ensure a robust and workable model for the Pathfinder unit.</p><p>The Department of Health has engaged extensively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and continues to do so, with the objective of agreeing an implementation option that fully addresses the above issues.  The demands on both departments as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic have presented challenges to progressing the proposals.</p></reply>

Pay restoration commenced in April 2019. Any outstanding balance would be paid in two equal amounts in 2020 and 2021, if due.</p>  <p>  The agreement reached at the WRC noted that some of the organisations (approximately 250) which did not form part of the pilot phase are also likely to have pay restoration issues. It stated that a process of engagement to address this would commence in 2019. It is the organisations who were identified in that initial agreement reached at the WRC in 2018 that are included in this final phase of pay restoration. </p>  <p>  The HSE have been costing this next phase of pay restoration and asked those eligible 250 organisations, who were included as part of the WRC agreement, to submit an application which will be subject to assessment and verification by the HSE. </p>  <p>  Following engagement at the Workplace Relations Commission in early December, the parties reached an agreement in relation to the 250 organisations.

These centres, which are opening in areas where the number of positive cases is particularly high, will allow people who don&rsquo;t have symptoms of COVID-19 to get a free test without having to contact their GP first. Around 20% of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic.</p>  <p>  The testing centres will be open from Thursday, 25 March to Wednesday, 31 March from 11am to 7pm. Social distancing measures will apply as people turn up for testing. </p>  <p>  Testing people with no symptoms will help to find positive cases earlier, will help in breaking chains of transmission and will help us better understand how and why the virus is spreading quicker in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  The initial locations at Blanchardstown, Grangegorman, Irishtown, Tallaght and Tullamore have been decided based on local disease prevalence and public health director&rsquo;s advice. The locations will change week-on-week.</p>  <p>  Anybody may use this free, walk-in COVID-19 testing provided they are aged 16 years and over; do not have symptoms of COVID-19 but would like to be tested; may not have their own GP (doctor); live within 5k of the walk-in testing centre.</p>  <p>  Persons who want to be tested should bring photo ID and provide a mobile phone number so the HSE can contact them with their results. Working with the National Ambulance Service, the HSE aims to carry out 300-500 COVID-19 tests per day at each walk-in centre. Any detected cases will be referred to contact tracing in the same way as detected cases that were referred through by a GP.</p>  <p>  The HSE has deployed antigen detection tests (ADTs) for use in specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p>  <p>  I have also set up a group, chaired by the government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, to examine the use of rapid tests in the community, and I will be considering the recommendations of this group.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  On 23 March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met.</p>  <p>  Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30<sup>th</sup>of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p><p>In relation to the categories of very high risk and high risk conditions, this list is not exhaustive. It may also include people who have been classed as at very high risk, based on clinical judgement and an assessment of need. It is recommended that the individuals concerned discuss this with their treating physician who is in the best position to give appropriate advice.</p></reply>

Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) funding has been leveraged by the Commission to facilitate its negotiations with vaccine manufacturers, including with regard to production costs and securing a reduced per dose cost for Member States. </p>  <p>  This process has provided Ireland with access to vaccines (at a reduced cost) that it would find it difficult to access otherwise within a year after the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO. Four of the vaccines in the EU portfolio have already been awarded Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) by the Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports efforts made by the Commission to safeguard the production and delivery of doses of vaccine in the quantities agreed with vaccine suppliers and to ensure that up-front funding provided through ESI has been properly used.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p><p>In relation to health needs, HSE Disability Services provide personal and social supports based on the needs of the individual, rather than the provision of services based on a specific diagnosis or condition. </p><p>The National Ability Supports System (NASS) captures information about the use and need for disability-funded services. NASS is managed by the National Health Information Systems Unit of the Health Research Board (HRB) on behalf of the Department of Health.  </p><p>The purpose of NASS is to gather service user information to aid the planning, development and organisation of HSE-funded disability services. </p><p>All individuals who receive or require a disability-funded service due to an intellectual disability, or a persistent physical, sensory, neurological, learning, autism spectrum, and/or speech/language disability arising from disease, disorder or trauma, should be registered on NASS.  </p><p>NASS captures data on service users who are in receipt of, or who require, services funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE) which are related to their disability. Certain services funded by Government departments such as Education and Social Protection may also be captured to forecast a future requirement for disability-funded services.  </p><p>Information collected on NASS will be critical to the management of disability services nationally and in ensuring the HSE understand the quantum of existing service usage and future service demand in order to plan for the provision of services to meet future needs of people with intellectual and physical and sensory disability. </p><p>Further details about NASS can be found on the website of the Health Research Board;   </p><p>The Department of Health has no direct function in relation to the provision of health and personal social services to individuals. The Department is responsible for the formulation and development of policy in respect of the provision of healthcare and support services; responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services rests with the Health Service Executive (HSE).  </p><p>In this regard, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time, of a range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; domestic surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. </p>  <p>  The legislation provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR. </p>  <p>  The Board of the Authority will be able to establish committees to advise the Board on matters relating to its functions and membership of these committees will have the relevant experience and expertise necessary to assist the Authority in carrying out its the functions. </p>  <p>  The Regulatory Authority will also be responsible for the development and preparation of Codes of Practice for the AHR provisions.  It is envisaged Codes of Practice would provide advice and guidance on how the AHR legislation will operate on a day-to-day basis "on the ground".  Under the legislation and prior to the finalisation of Codes of Practice, draft codes of practice will be published to allow a consultation process where representations can be made on the draft code.  This will ensure that stakeholders, including those from the disability sector, can input into the development of the Code. </p>  <p>  Overall, the provisions outlined within the legislation will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight.  The aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR is the key principle underpinning all legislative measures in this area.</p></reply>

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts. </p><p>In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there are 3,532 people in receipt of the interim payments at March, 2021. </p><p>At the whole of Government level, the <i>National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021</i>sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the <i>Strategy</i>is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group. </p><p>Under the<i>Strategy</i>,  the Department of Transport, has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.  </p><p>Work is ongoing on the policy proposals for the provision of transport supports for people with disabilities.  I intend to revert to Government with proposals in due course.  Recent developments which will impact on the policy options include the following: </p><p>- The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport in providing accessible public transport nationally<i></i>and that Department's public consultation, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;</p><p>- The <i>Cost of Disability Study </i>currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; </p><p>- The Working Group established under Action 104 of the <i>National Disability Inclusion Strategy </i>by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that:- <i>'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;</i>; and</p><p>- The review of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme by the Department of Finance. </p><p>Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; the Revenue Commissioners Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p></reply>

This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p><p>HIQA, in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing home meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. This Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.</p><p>Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.</p><p>Residents of nursing homes are vulnerable because of their age, underlying medical conditions, the extent of their requirement for direct care involving close physical contact and the nature of living in congregated settings. The very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings. The transmission of the virus into and within nursing homes is multifactorial. As identified by the Nursing Homes Expert Panel, where there is ongoing community transmission, settings like nursing homes are more vulnerable to exposure.</p><p>The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need for the HSE to set up a structured support system in line with NPHET recommendations. This has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID-19. The supports provided during the first wave included:</p><p>- Enhanced HSE engagement.</p><p>- Temporary HSE governance arrangements.</p><p>- Multidisciplinary clinical supports at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams.</p><p>- Access to supply lines for PPE, medical oxygen etc.; significant volumes of PPE was supplied to private and voluntary nursing homes on a without charge basis.</p><p>- Serial testing in nursing homes.</p><p>- Access to staff from community and acute hospitals.</p><p>- Suite of focused guidance.</p><p>- Temporary financial support scheme established, with over &euro;80.1m in additional funding support provided thus far at 26 March. The Scheme is open until 30 June 2021.</p><p>- Temporary accommodation to nursing home staff.</p><p>- HIQA Infection Prevention Hub.</p><p>- <i>Regulatory Assessment Framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a COVID-19 outbreak</i>designed by HIQA.</p></reply>

Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p>  <p>  Further to this support, a commitment to introduce the model of care for infertility, which was developed by officials in my Department in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme, is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;.  This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks, which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.    </p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system.  Phase Two will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated, and the AHR legislation is commenced.  Drafting of the AHR legislation is ongoing, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>  It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.</p></reply>

In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30<sup>th</sup>of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p></reply>

This model of care was developed by officials in my Department in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme and will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  </p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.  Funding of &euro;2m was provided to the HSE to commence Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care in 2020.  This was utilised specifically in respect of the development of the first four Regional Fertility Hubs &ndash; namely, Cork Maternity University Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital. </p>  <p>  Additional funding of just over &euro;1m has been made available to enable the continuation of Phase One of the roll-out in 2021, including through the setting-up of the final two Regional Fertility Hubs, to be located in Galway and Limerick.  </p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system.  Phase Two will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated, and the AHR legislation is commenced.  It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years. </p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>On 23<sup>rd</sup>March the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;. This plan outlines a three phased plan for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first.</p><p>Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads. The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p><p>The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation. </p><p>The NTPF have advised that they have provided funding for a number of Insourcing initiatives to reduce Gynaecology waiting lists at Tallaght University Hospital in 2020. As a result, 475 patients have to date received treatment through HSE Insourcing initiatives. Details of these initiatives are outlined in the attached document.</p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as to address waiting lists. <table>    <tr>       <td>Approved Outpatient (OPD) NTPF initiatives for Gynaecology for 2020 and to date 2021 for Tallaght University Hospital</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="4">NTPF Insourcing Approved OPD Gynaecology Initatives Tallaght University Hospital as at 26/03/2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Specialty</td>       <td>Initiative Type</td>       <td>Volume</td>       <td>Notes</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gynaecology</td>       <td>OPD</td>       <td>100</td>       <td>Nurse-led clinic</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gynaecology</td>       <td>OPD</td>       <td>125</td>       <td>GP-led clinic</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gynaecology</td>       <td>OPD</td>       <td>250</td>       <td>Physio-led clinic</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Total</td>       <td>475</td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The GMHS website and other resources such as <i>www.man2man.ie </i>and<i>www.sexualwellbeing.ie</i>are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved STI and PrEP services. </p><p>All PrEP service providers have maintained existing PrEP service users in the programme, providing virtual consultations, postal prescriptions and attendance for screening or treatment where necessary. It is difficult to predict the level of any number of infectious diseases including STIs that will occur post pandemic, but with the resumption of normal service, there is an expectation that increased testing will bring increased diagnoses.</p><p>The HSE is continuing to progress a number of initiatives that aim to reduce the level of HIV and STIs nationally and improve access to services for those in need.  </p><p>- The promotion of safer sex messages to the public via a range of social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. </p><p>- During the pandemic, the public has been advised about STI clinic restrictions and encouraged to consider safer sexual practices to reduce the risk of HIV and STI transmission.  </p><p>- Those who are symptomatic are advised to contact a clinic directly for an emergency appointment. </p><p>- Guidance was issued around sex and COVID-19 which advised the public to limit numbers of partners to reduce transmission of HIV/STIs as well as COVID-19 during the pandemic.  </p><p>- Condoms are freely available to NGO partners and service providers via the National Condom Distribution service and a number of NGOs established postal services to make condoms and lubricant accessible to service-users throughout the pandemic while venues were closed. </p><p>- Free rapid HIV testing is available in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick through community NGO partners HIV Ireland, Sexual Health Centre Cork, Sexual Health West and GOSHH. NGO partners have adapted their services and are currently providing free rapid HIV testing from their offices or alternative venues.  </p><p>- STI/HIV testing is currently available through a HSE home STI testing pilot project in Dublin, Cork and Kerry. Tests are being made available in a phased manner to ensure there is sufficient capacity in local clinics for service users who may need follow-up treatment or support.</p><p>At the outset of Covid-19, staff in the Gay Men&rsquo;s Health Service  were reassigned, by reason of necessity, to other HSE services. Some staff continue to be redeployed to Covid-19 services, including to the COVID-19 vaccination programme which commenced in recent months. COVID-19 has placed increased demands on HSE services which are require to be delivered in accordance with current restrictions. </p><p>Community Healthcare East re-opened the  GMHS in January 2021 on a phased basis, and in line with Government and HSE Guidelines. Existing PrEP users continue to be seen in the GMHS. The Clinic Consultant and other doctors are providing virtual consultations, and PrEP service users attend the GMHS for STI screening and blood testing. Those with diagnosed STIs, or requiring Hepatitis and/or HPV vaccine, continue to be treated in GMHS also. </p><p>Previously the GMHS relied heavily on agency staff. This is no longer the situation. The funding allocated to the HSE in respect of the GMHS PrEP programme was received in 2020 as recurring funding. This has facilitated a recruitment campaign to fill the posts for the GMHS PrEP programme to commence in the latter part of 2020. This recruitment is on-going.</p><p>HSE Community Healthcare East will continue to reinstate services in the GMHS on a phased basis and in line with the HSE&rsquo;s Safe Return to Work Guide. HSE Community Healthcare East has made every effort to restore, and maintain services as far as possible and will continue to do so, subject to current demand for health services, and subject to resources available.</p></reply>

Key achievements to date include: </p>  <p>  - The rollout of a national treatment programme of Pre &ndash; Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEp) </p>  <p>  - Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Fast Track Cities HIV global partnership project which is driving the response to HIV/AIDS across 300 cities </p>  <p>  - Establishment of the National Condom Distribution Service which distributes free condoms and lubricant sachets to a range of vulnerable groups  </p>  <p>  - A wide range of educational and promotional work with the education system, parents, children and young people to ensure that they receive the information and resources they need to support their relationship and sexual needs </p>  <p>  - An ongoing programme of research to provide the evidence base needed to ensure robust policy development  </p>  <p>  - Responding to the challenges posed by the Covid 19 pandemic in the maintenance of vital HIV/STI services. All health services, including STI/HIV services are continuing to face service restrictions due to the current impact of Covid-19 on the hospital system and social distancing requirements. Public STI clinics are prioritising those with symptoms or requiring treatment, and this includes anyone who may be referred for confirmation HIV testing. </p>  <p>  The current Strategy was intended to cover the period from 2015 &ndash; 2020, but has now been extended to 2021. It is the intention of my Department to conduct stakeholder consultations and a review of the NSHS this year. The outcome of the consultations and the review will determine the future direction of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the HSE is currently piloting a free home STI/HIV testing service, supported by the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund, in Dublin, Cork and Kerry. The first phase of tests were made available early January. As a result of very high initial demand for the service, tests will now be made available in a phased manner to ensure there is sufficient capacity in local clinics for service users who may need follow-up treatment or support. </p>  <p>  Learnings from this pilot will inform the future direction of online testing, which may prove to be a very valuable intervention in terms of meeting demand for STI services, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, given the ongoing need to comply with necessary pandemic restrictions, including social distancing</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the manner and location of future sexual health services will be made in the context of the above factors. </p></reply>

A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products. The IBTS constantly keeps all deferral policies under review to ensure the ongoing safety of blood and the products derived from it. </p>  <p>  The IBTS lifted its lifelong ban on men who have sex with men (MSM) from donating blood in January 2017, when the deferral policy was reduced to a period of one year following their last sexual encounter with a man. </p>  <p>  The IBTS continues to keep this, and all of its deferral policies, under active review in the light of scientific evidence, emerging infections and international experience. </p>  <p>  The IBTS advise that a review is underway which examines the risks associated with social behaviours that may result in a deferral from blood donation due to risks of transmission of infectious diseases.  The review will consider the 12-month deferral currently in place for men that have sex with men.  The option of introducing individual risk-based assessment for blood donors will also be considered as part of the review.</p></reply>

This impact has been witnessed across all waiting list categories, including G.I. Endoscopy.</p><p>G.I. Endoscopy services were heavily affected during the first surge of COVID-19. In 2020 the scheduled care waiting list for GI Scopes grew by 46% (+10,295) to 32,539. In early 2021, due to the further curtailment of scheduled care, G.I. Scope waiting lists increased by a further 13% to 36,820 by the end of February 2021. </p><p>The HSE continues to work to improve access, particularly to urgent colonoscopy services. The HSE&rsquo;s National Clinical Advisor and Group Lead for Acute Operations has recommended that, where possible, endoscopy services be maintained in the current surge. This may involve relocation of the service to designated non-COVID sites to preserve throughput or to private providers, if available.</p><p>In addition, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is working closely with individual hospitals to improve access to endoscopy/colonoscopy services for waiting list patients, including through the outsourcing of G.I. Scopes treatment to Private Hospitals where capacity is available.  In 2020 the NTPF arranged 7,399 scopes for patients. The NTPF continues to commission treatment for patients and plans to double the number of scopes it arranges in 2021.</p><p>The table, provided by the NTPF, shows the number of patients awaiting a colonoscopy at each public hospital, by time band at the end of February 2021. </p><p>In relation to the specific query raised regarding records of bowel cancer and other serious illnesses diagnosed as a result of colonoscopies, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

Those aged over 70 years and over and others at increased risk of severe illness should exercise judgement regarding the extent to which they engage with others and in activities outside home. But in general, the guidance for these cohorts is now aligned with that for the general population, including for activities such as using public transport and shopping. It is advised that anyone in this cohort should speak to their employer if they wish to return to work. It is important to emphasis that the current guidance remains that everyone should continue to work from home if they can do so and this also applies to those that are fully vaccinated. As the Deputy will be aware, fully vaccinated asymptomatic people are now also being advised that they can visit other fully vaccinated asymptomatic people in a household setting without wearing masks or physical distancing.

Furthermore, many of the newer products being licensed are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>The process for assessing applications works very well where the new medicines have strong evidence of clinical effectiveness and are priced in a cost-effective manner. Delays in reimbursement decisions for new products may occur in cases where the evidence of clinical effectiveness is weak, and where prices are set well outside of cost effectiveness parameters.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, additional funding of &euro;50m was provided for new medicines in Budget 2021. This funding will allow the HSE Executive Management Team to approve new and innovative medicines which have been recommended by the HSE Drugs Group on the basis of efficacy and value for money in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p><p>As of 10 March, the HSE had approved reimbursement of 21 new medicines or new uses of existing medicines in 2021. The HSE will continue assess any pricing and reimbursement applications received for new medicines, in line with the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that publication of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a wide range of practices, including domestic surrogacy.</p>  <p>  The surrogacy  provisions outline the specific conditions under which surrogacy in Ireland will be permitted, including a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be pre-authorised by the AHR Regulatory Authority, the establishment of which the Bill will provide for. The legislation also sets out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s).</p>  <p>  Overall, the aim of the AHR legislation is to promote and ensure the health and safety of parents and others involved in the process (such as donors and surrogate mothers), while, most importantly, consideration of the welfare and best interests of children born as a result of AHR is a key principle underpinning the legislation.</p></reply>

All service providers look forward to the restoration of normal visiting and the accommodation of partners, when it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  However, the reality is that we are still experiencing high levels of infection across the country, the health service remains under pressure and there remains a considerable risk that Ireland will experience a further wave of infection. In that context, it is important to note that the restrictions in maternity services are designed to protect mothers, babies and staff.  </p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has issued guidance regarding attendance at acute hospitals during the pandemic, including attendance at maternity hospitals. The guidance advises that restrictions on partner visiting; accompanying persons in labour; or parents visiting neonatal intensive care units, should be based on a documented risk assessment that is regularly reviewed. Given the current level of community transmission, and the risk that the virus will be imported into maternity hospitals, all maternity hospitals are reviewing their visiting restrictions on a weekly basis, with some undertaking reviews daily. In that regard, I am advised that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has, and will, continue to engage with the Clinical Leads for Maternity Services/Women&rsquo;s Health in each Hospital Group and the Directors of Midwifery in each maternity unit.</p></reply>

Ireland is still experiencing high levels of infection across the country and the health service remains under pressure. Level 5 restrictive measures therefore remain in place. Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo;provides for restrictions on gatherings. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.</p>  <p>  The Framework sets out when it is considered that organised outdoor events can take place. At Level 5, no organised outdoor gatherings should take place.</p>  <p>  I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made by people across the country at this difficult time. That includes the many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus due to the huge effort of our citizens. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to avoid the virus spreading.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-31a.3191.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021033100129#WROOO04100"><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, commonly referred to as the Fair Deal Scheme, has been in operation for over 10 years and there is broad agreement that the Scheme operates well and continues to provide appropriate financial assistance where it is required. Those accepted to the Scheme pay a proportion of the value of their assessed income and assets towards the cost of the Scheme, so that those who can afford to pay more, do so, while protecting the Scheme's ability to assist those with fewer resources. There are no plans to amend the charge paid by persons availing of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  However, it is recognised that the Act, in its current form, does not place caps on the financial assessment of family owned and operated farms or businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care. This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p>  <p>  This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I requested a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny from the Business Committee, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il, and this waiver was granted on 4th February 2021. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. It is on the priority list for publication in the Spring legislative session. The Bill will be enacted upon completion of all stages in the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On 23 February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.</p><p>On 30 March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details are available at the link:</p></reply>

All service providers look forward to the restoration of normal visiting and the accommodation of partners, when it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  However, the reality is that we are still experiencing high levels of infection across the country, the health service remains under pressure and there remains a considerable risk that Ireland will experience a further wave of infection. In that context, it is important to note that the restrictions in maternity services are designed to protect mothers, babies and staff. </p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has issued guidance regarding attendance at acute hospitals during the pandemic, including attendance at maternity hospitals. The guidance advises that restrictions on partner visiting; accompanying persons in labour; or parents visiting neonatal intensive care units, should be based on a documented risk assessment that is regularly reviewed. Given the current level of community transmission, and the risk that the virus will be imported into maternity hospitals, all maternity hospitals are reviewing their visiting restrictions on a weekly basis, with some undertaking reviews daily. In that regard, I am advised that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has, and will, continue to engage with the Clinical Leads for Maternity Services/Women&rsquo;s Health in each Hospital Group and the Directors of Midwifery in each maternity unit.</p></reply>

To this end, a Dialogue Forum with Voluntary Organisations was established in December 2019 as recommended in the Report as a key mechanism for strengthening this relationship. The aim of the Forum is to build a stronger working relationship between the State and the voluntary healthcare sector for the benefit of patients and service users. The Forum will also facilitate regular dialogue with the voluntary sector on policy initiatives and will consider issues around governance more generally.</p>  <p>  The Forum is independently chaired by Peter Cassells. Members of the Forum include the Department, the HSE, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission and the main representative bodies of voluntary providers of health and social care: The Wheel; Mental Health Reform; Disability Federation of Ireland; Not for Profit Association; National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers; Voluntary Healthcare Forum; Voluntary Hospices Group and National Community Care Network.</p>  <p>  The Forum met twice in December 2019 and January 2020, but further meetings scheduled for March 2020 and May 2020 were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In mid-2020 the Chair convened a sub-group of the Forum to act as a planning group to assist him in planning and, where appropriate, progressing the work of the Forum. The Planning Group met online in September, November and December 2020.</p>  <p>  A full Forum meeting planned for the end of January was postponed due to the demands the third wave of the pandemic has placed on Forum members. It is planned to recommence Forum meetings as soon as feasible. In the meantime, the Chair continues to engage with Members directly.</p>  <p>  More generally, many of the Independent Review Group Report&rsquo;s recommendations dovetail with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme and are being considered in that context. In addition, some recommendations are being taken forward in the context of the Department of Rural and Community Development&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities: A Five-Year Strategy to Support the Community and Voluntary Sector in Ireland 2019-2024&rsquo;.</p></reply>

Key achievements to date include:</p><p>- The roll-out of a national treatment programme of Pre &ndash; Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEp)</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Fast Track Cities HIV global partnership project which is driving the response to HIV/AIDS across 300 cities</p><p>- Establishment of the National Condom Distribution Service which distributes free condoms and lubricant sachets to a range of vulnerable groups</p><p>- A wide range of educational and promotional work with the education system, parents, children and young people to ensure that they receive the information and resources they need to support their relationship and sexual needs</p><p>- An ongoing programme of research to provide the evidence base needed to ensure robust policy development</p><p>- Responding to the challenges posed by the Covid 19 pandemic in the maintenance of vital HIV/STI services. All health services, including STI/HIV services are continuing to face service restrictions due to the current impact of Covid-19 on the hospital system and social distancing requirements. Public STI clinics are prioritising those with symptoms or requiring treatment, and this includes anyone who may be referred for confirmation HIV testing.</p><p>The current Strategy was intended to cover the period from 2015 &ndash; 2020, but has now been extended to 2021. It is the intention of my Department to conduct stakeholder consultations and a review of the NSHS this year. The outcome of the consultations and the review will determine the future direction of the Strategy. </p><p>It should be noted that the HSE is currently piloting a free home STI/HIV testing service, supported by the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund, in Dublin, Cork and Kerry. The first phase of tests were made available early January. As a result of very high initial demand for the service, tests will now be made available in a phased manner to ensure there is sufficient capacity in local clinics for service users who may need follow-up treatment or support.</p><p>Learnings from this pilot will inform the future direction of online testing, which may prove to be a very valuable intervention in terms of meeting demand for STI services, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, given the ongoing need to comply with necessary pandemic restrictions, including social distancing</p><p>Decisions in relation to the manner and location of future sexual health services will be made in the context of the above factors. </p><p>It should also be noted that there are 23 STI services across the country. Phone lines, the GMHS website and other resources such as <i>www.man2man.ie</i>and <i>www.sexualwellbeing.ie</i>are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved STI and PrEP services. It should be noted that, while the Gay Men's Health Service is the only service dedicated solely to the needs of a subset of the LGBTI+ community, wider STI services are available in 22 other locations, and can also provide the necessary services.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.</p><p>On the 30<sup>th</sup>of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and the Department of Health, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details are available here:</p></reply>

The Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for COVID-19 clusters are identified.</p><p>Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations.</p><p>Residents of nursing homes are vulnerable because of their age, underlying medical conditions, the extent of their requirement for direct care involving close physical contact and the nature of living in congregated settings. The very infectious nature of COVID-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings. The transmission of the virus into and within nursing homes is multifactorial. As identified by the Nursing Homes Expert Panel, where there is ongoing community transmission, settings like nursing homes are more vulnerable to exposure.</p><p>The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need to set up a structured support system in line with NPHET recommendations. This has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID-19.</p><p>These supports remain in place and include:</p><p>- Enhanced HSE engagement;</p><p>- Multidisciplinary clinical supports at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams;</p><p>- Supply of precautionary and enhanced PPE, free of charge;</p><p>- Serial testing programme for all staff of nursing homes;</p><p>- Where possible, access to staff from community and acute hospitals;</p><p>- Suite of focused public health guidance and training resources.</p><p>- Temporary financial support scheme established, with over &euro;80.1m in additional funding support provided thus far at 26 March.

The Health (Amendment) Act provides for a system of mandatory quarantine at designated facilities, including for travellers who have been in a designated state within 14 days of arrival to Ireland. Arrivals from all other overseas countries continue to be required to observe mandatory home quarantine.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the national testing strategy for COVID-19 involves testing people who meet the case definition which is currently: those with COVID-19 symptoms; as part of established serial testing programmes including residential care facilities, schools and food production facilities, and following the completion of a Public Health Risk Assessment. In addition, a walk-in service for asymptomatic persons in five areas of high incidence was introduced on 25 March 2021 as part of the HSE&rsquo;s enhanced COVID-19 testing for local communities. The initial locations have been selected based on local disease prevalence and public health director&rsquo;s advice, and these locations are subject to change week-on-week. In addition, mass testing is offered in response to outbreaks settings following the completion of a Public Health Risk Assessment. </p>  <p>  At the request of the National Public Health Emergency Team, a SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance &amp;amp; Whole Genome Sequencing Working Group has developed recommendations relating to the establishment of a National SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance &amp;amp; Whole Genome Sequencing Programme. The purpose of the recommendations is to ensure early detection and characterisation of emerging variant viruses to define if they are of particular concern and assessing the impact of genetic and antigenic variant viruses for the pandemic and monitoring them over time to guide public health action.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Programme is to use whole genome sequencing to inform and enhance the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This will be achieved through a number of specific objectives including national surveillance of variants, early detection of variants of concern, complex outbreak investigation etc. </p>  <p>  Sequencing of random samples from travellers arriving into the country who have presented for testing has been undertaken in Ireland, and all detected samples from those arriving from, or having transited through designated States are sequenced. More broadly, approximately 10% (and at times, up to 15%) of all positive samples in Ireland are currently being sequenced. Work is underway to ensure ongoing standing capacity is available for sequencing of at least 10% of all positive samples. </p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of antigen detection tests in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing. The HSE has deployed ADTs for use in specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have also set up a group, chaired by the government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, to examine the use of rapid tests in the community, and I will be considering the recommendations of this group.</p>  <p>  Ireland is pursuing a robust testing strategy under the guidance of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm.</p></reply>

NPDWAG membership encompasses a wide range of key stakeholders, including other Government departments and agencies, local authorities, industry representative bodies, farming organisations, water sector organisations and amenity sector organisations. Actions taken include awareness-raising measures, measures to promote Integrated Pest Management approaches, regulatory measures concerning various plant protection products and measures to promote research to protect water quality.</p>  <p>  Irish Water monitor public water supplies for pesticides and report the results to the EPA, who are the regulator for drinking water quality. The NPDWAG takes a range of actions in specific areas identified by the EPA. These areas include some water supplies in Cork. Cork County Council are represented on the NPDWAG and they work in partnership with other NPDWAG stakeholders as part of a coordinated approach to the protection of drinking water quality.</p>  <p>  Measures at national level implemented under the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive are important as well. These include training of pesticide users, distributors and advisors, inspection and certification of pesticide application equipment, and safeguard zones to protect drinking water sources. Other important measures are specified in the principles of Good Plant Protection Practice (GPPP), which all professional users of pesticides are legally obliged to follow.</p>  <p>  A number of specific regulatory measures relating to MCPA products have been introduced in recent years. These include a reduction in the maximum allowed application rate for products that only contain MCPA, an extended prohibited use period, and a mandatory no-spray buffer zone of 5 m along all watercourses. My Department has also introduced a mandatory product stewardship scheme, in force since the start of 2018, making it a regulatory requirement for companies marketing products containing MCPA to participate in a programme of intensive monitoring of raw water in priority drinking water catchment areas for MCPA and chemically similar active substances.</p>  <p>  This is an area of active engagement with all stakeholders for my Department.</p></reply>

There are no proposals being considered that will alter that situation.</p><p>However, from January 2022 antiparasitic veterinary medicines will require a veterinary prescription before they can be sold.</p><p>In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in European law. These criteria have remained largely unchanged in Regulation 2019/6. A copy of the report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website <i>www.hpra.ie</i>.</p><p>It concluded that the scientific evidence of resistance to antiparasitic veterinary medicines present in food-producing animals now available is compelling and stark and present a real risk to animal rearing and food production in grass based systems. Arising from this, antiparasitic veterinary medicines must require a veterinary prescription before they can be dispensed from January 2022. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s interpretation of Regulation Article 105(4) is that Ireland is not in a position to avail of the derogation which allows persons other than registered veterinary practitioners to issue veterinary prescriptions. This view has been informed through consideration by policy officials, consultation with the EU Commission and with internal legal advisors.</p><p>However, given the range of stakeholder views on Article 105(4), the Department committed to seeking further legal advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office which was submitted in late 2020 and is receiving attention in that office currently.</p><p>It is the intention of my Department to make a statement on the matter to all stakeholders when received. </p><p>Several stakeholders, including Licensed Merchants, have raised concerns about  anti-parasitic resistance and also the potential impact of this change in regulation. To address this, my Department has established an Antiparasitic Resistance Stakeholder Group which is chaired by the Chief Veterinary Officer. This group has an extensive work programme which is on-going and its considerations are being guided by two principal objectives:</p><p>- Protecting the efficacy of antiparasitics which are critical to the Irish pasture-based production model.</p><p>- Establishing a regulatory system that is pragmatic, retains a substantive role for existing stakeholders and delivers value for money for farmers.</p></reply>

While no legal basis exists for a mandatory compensation scheme under EU legislation in respect of the Low Pathogenic H6N1 Avian Influenza outbreak in 2020, a once-off financial support scheme was established following DPER approval, to provide some support to affected poultry producers.</p>  <p>  Regarding the December 2020 outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, the Animal Health and Welfare Act, No. 15 of 2013 does allow me, as Minister, to support farmers in the event of outbreaks of certain diseases which includes Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and this provision is currently being availed of.</p>  <p>  In addition, some excellent supports are already in place such as the use of the RDP-funded Targeted Advisory Service for Animal Health measure for assessing farm level biosecurity risks that is available at no cost to poultry farmers.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to explore what additional measures could be utilised, within the context of existing national and EU legislation, to support the industry as much as possible in their pursuit of establishing a funding support system for use by the industry in the face of poultry disease challenges. We will update Industry on these findings shortly, together with an update on the three other report recommendations.</p></reply>

In addition to this, seven licences that had been remitted to my Department following appeal to the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) were reissued. This was clearly an outlier week relative to every other week to date this year.</p>  <p>  The average number of licences issuing year to date is 67 new licences every week. In the week just gone, the figure was 65. Year to date afforestation licences are up 14% (in hectares), road licences are up 125% (in km) and felling up 53% (in m3) when compared to same quarter last year.</p>  <p>  We are still committed to meeting our target of 4,500 new licences for 2021 and it is essential that we do so. There will be weeks within the year when the figures fluctuate and its important to keep the focus on the high level targets for the year which are needed for the sector to continue to develop.</p>  <p>There are a number of factors which can influence the figures and, in the month of March, the impact on the high level figures is because Coillte now have almost all their licensing requirements already issued for 2021. In week ending 19th March, they submitted 1,864 licences for their proposed clear fell operations in 2022 and 2023. Coillte licensing now enters an interim phase, while the initial processing stages of these new licences takes place before further licences issue, as happens when a new batch of applications is received. I would like to note here that these new applications and supporting documents may be viewed for the first time, in my Department&rsquo;s Forestry Licence Viewer, which assists the public in participating in the decision-making process.</p>  <p>  As for private forestry licences, we are continuing to aim to improve output, mindful of the additional resources deployed in recent months. The Working Groups under Project Woodland have met and engagement has been positive. Working Group 4 &ndash; Process Improvement will be looking at licensing processes, including the forestry regulation process; environmental reports and assessments; and training courses as part of their remit. I look forward to further updates on the progress of these groups and the Project as a whole.</p></reply>

Similarly, roads licences have improved compared to the same months last year and 50% of the target for 2021 has been licenced by mid-March.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge that the progress that has been made needs to be improved and sustained. Consequently, we are implementing internal changes to improve output including training, increased assistance to ecologists in the preparation of files, improved IT resources for ecologists and other system improvements. In addition, we are engagement intensively with the sector who also have a role to play by is focusing on improvement in the quality and consistency of applications and subsequent information including NISs.</p>  <p>  Through Project Woodland, there is now a dedicated working group around the Backlog and establishing KPIs and a separate working group is charged with examining our internal processes that includes an end-to-end review of systems to ensure that they are made more efficient and are environmentally robust.

Under the current proposals, a new Basic Income Support for Sustainability will replace the current Basic Payment Scheme. I am acutely aware of the importance of the financial support provided under these direct payment schemes for Irish farmers, and am committed to ensuring that my Department continues to implement such schemes in a fair manner. For example, I have always been clear in my support for the capping of payments as a key tool to support a fair distribution of payments.</p>  <p>  The CAP reform proposals presented by the European Commission in June 2018 included a number of mandatory redistributive proposals for Direct Payments including capping and degressivity, increased convergence of payments and a redistributive scheme to support sustainability. During the negotiation process, the Agrifish Council of Ministers has adopted a position which supports the optional inclusion of these schemes as part of a suite of measures that Member States can select from depending on their particular national circumstances. This allows Member States, who have vastly different farm structures, to make the optimum choices for their circumstances. The Trilogue negotiations on these proposals are ongoing and the final shape of the CAP Regulations and the options available to Member States will not be clear until this process is concluded.</p>  <p>  As this process develops, I will continue to engage with stakeholders on this issue with a view to ensuring that the developing EU regulations include a suite of measures which will enable us to ensure the fair implementation of these vital financial supports.</p></reply>

It is proposed that the funding mechanism will be similar to the current system, whereby payment entitlements with values above the average are reduced to fund the convergence.</p>  <p>  This proposal builds on the convergence path of the 2015-2020 CAP regulations, under which all entitlements had to reach a minimum value of 60% of the national average by 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department is analysing the effects of all of the proposed changes, including changes to convergence, and is engaged on an ongoing basis with European colleagues as well as farm organisations here. This close engagement and detailed analysis of the impact of the proposals on farmers in Ireland will continue until the regulations are fully developed and will, in due course, inform the decision-making process on the implementation of new CAP regulations in Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland has supported this element of these proposals. Convergence aims to redistribute and flatten the value of CAP payment entitlements and like all elements of the CAP, there are differing views regarding its implementation.</p>  <p>  Under the current CAP, some &euro;93million was redistributed from farmers with payment entitlements values above the national average to raise the value of payment entitlement held by farmers that were below the national average. This was implemented in a planned, phased manner over the five years of the Basic Payment Scheme and the steps of this convergence were notified to each farmer. This period of planned convergence ended in 2019 following its successful implementation.</p>  <p>  The regulation regarding the transition period enables member states to continue convergence during the transition period, if they so wish. In order to provide for stability, some certainty for farmers and consultation on CAP measures, Ireland chose to rest convergence during the years 2020 to 2022.</p>  <p>  We are now in the transition period between the old CAP ending and the new CAP commencing in 2023. Following my appointment as Minister, I examined with Department officials the possibility of continuing convergence in 2021. However, given the enormous logistical and operational requirements in the process, the timeframe was not available to consider making changes for 2021.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to consult with farm organisations for the second transition year of 2022 as well as for the CAP programme to further consider how to continue the convergence process. This engagement will take place over the coming months in order to make a timely decision for the 2022 period and beyond.</p></reply>

While the value of individual payment entitlements can be traced back to an initial reference period of 2000-2002, the effect of this has been significantly moderated through convergence.</p>  <p>  During the current CAP programme, farmers who held low value payment entitlements have benefitted from this process. Farmers with payment entitlement values less than 90% of the average have seen their payment entitlement values increase over the period 2015-2019. In 2019, all payment entitlement values reached a minimum of 60% of the national average.</p>  <p>  The new legislative proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy 2021-2027 include a continuation of the process of internal convergence, to a minimum of 75% of the national average. The European Parliament argues for a higher level of convergence. Final agreement on the CAP is dependent on the outcome of trilogue negotiations between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which commenced in November 2020 and are likely to run for some months yet.</p></reply>

A detailed breakdown of figures for 2015 to 2018 provides information of the net log imports minus log exports for this time series. The data currently available is outlined in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Log imports less log exports (in m3)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>- 205, 000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>- 65,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>- 16,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>40,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>*A negative figure means there was a net outflow of logs from the Republic of Ireland exported (which includes logs moving to Northern Ireland)</td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Detailed figures for 2019 and 2020 are not yet available. Detailed information on all COFORD Connect series are available on www.coford.ie. The weblink to the published <i>Woodflow and the forest &ndash; based biomass energy use on the island of Ireland</i>2018 can be assessed at . These also provide detailed information on harvesting levels against projected timber forecasts. Trade data is also included along with information on the use of forest based biomass for energy.</p><p>In relation to the importation of sawlog from Scotland, the Department can confirm that in the four months September to December 2019, the average monthly importation of logs was 5,245 tonnes. In the year 2020, this figure was 10,488 tonnes/month and year to date in 2021, the average monthly importation of logs from Scotland is 17,896 tonnes/month. Even with these higher import figures this year, it still represents less than 10% of overall consumption by Irish sawmills.</p><p>The Department has invested heavily in both ecologist and forestry Inspector resources over the last 18 months in order to meet the needs of the licencing system. We now have 21 full-time equivalent  ecologists where previously we had one just 18 months ago. This has resulted in a significant improvement in the licencing output with, for example, almost three million m3 of felling licences issuing from last October to January. Similarly, roads licences have improved considerably compared to the same months last year and 50% of the target for 2021 has already been licenced by mid-March.</p><p>We acknowledge that the progress that has been made needs to be improved and sustained. Consequently, we are implementing internal changes to improve output including training, increased assistance to ecologists in the preparation of files, improved IT resources for ecologists and other system improvements. In addition, we are engagement intensively with the sector who also have a role to play by is focusing on improvement in the quality and consistency of applications and subsequent information including NISs.</p><p>Through Project Woodland, there is now a dedicated working group around the Backlog and establishing KPIs and a separate working group is charged with examining our internal processes that includes an end-to-end review of systems to ensure that they are made more efficient and are environmentally robust. We are recruiting project management and systems analyst expertise to assist in this process.</p><p>Overall, we have set ourselves a target of issuing 4,500 new licences this year which would be a 75% increase on last year. This is a massive undertaking but I believe it is possible to achieve with the collaboration of all.</p></reply>

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s. The possibility of a dredging project has been under consideration for some time.</p><p>The project will involve the dredging of circa 240,000 cubic meters of dredge material and reuse of material in land reclamation. The land reclamation area will provide a mix of recreational public access green areas, slipway access to the water for small craft and provide areas for business, harbour operations and transport.</p><p>My Department tendered for a Consulting Engineering practice on 3<sup>rd</sup>October 2018 to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase and should a decision be made to progress the project, this consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works.</p><p>The project will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement and a Waste License. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project, including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors.</p><p>As part of the planning process, my Department is currently engaged in a Public Consultation process the closure date for submissions is Friday 9th April 2021.</p><p>Following the collation of information raised in the consultation process, the intention is to commence the planning phase of the project in May 2021, with the required EPA licencing process to follow after grant of Planning Permission. It is expected that the planning and permitting phase could take at least 12 months.</p><p>As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging project in Howth FHC will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

The &lsquo;Standards for Felling and Reforestation&rsquo; from October 2019 is still the current document today.</p><p>This new standards document sets out the standards that apply to all felling (thinning and clearfelling) and reforestation projects on all sites throughout Ireland, undertaken under a felling licence issued by the Department under the Forestry Regulations, 2017 (S.I.

This unfortunately did not happen due to pressure of work and to date the document has not been revised to take account of the comments received.</p><p>The Department is committed to updating this document and the Mackinnon Report has made specific recommendations on the review of these types of standards and documents. Under the Implementation of the Project Woodland plan, the updating of Forest Standard documents is a key deliverable for consideration by one of the Working Groups.

It is important to be aware however, that this office will have no role in the determination of commodity prices at any stage of the chain.</p>  <p>  My Department is taking a two step approach to the establishment of the National Authority. Firstly, a statutory instrument will be drafted to transpose the UTP Directive by the deadline of 1st May 2021. This will provide for an Enforcement Authority which will have the powers as currently provided for in the Directive. The legislative and operational requirements for establishing a new Office of a Food Ombudsman or equivalent that might provide for functions other than those provided for in the UTP Directive are being examined. Primary legislation will be required both to establish this new authority, and to provide for any further powers which may be given to that office. It is intended that there will shortly be a national consultation process on the possible functions of the NFO.</p>  <p>  As for legislation in relation to price determination, the price paid for goods is a matter between buyers and sellers and a function of supply and demand. In the context of food production, the costs of production differ substantially between individual producers. Similarly, the cost of processing, marketing and transport, the market price obtained for processed food, and the margin considered necessary to keep the business going, are all factors taken into account in the context of price determination.

I am confident we will make substantial progress on our shared goal of supporting a sustainable, inclusive and empowered community and voluntary sector in Ireland for the years ahead.</p></reply>
