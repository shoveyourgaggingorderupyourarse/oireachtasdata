Applicants for illness-related schemes should provide, at the outset, all information they have in relation to medical conditions and the effect of those conditions on their capacity to work or their care needs.</p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy that claim processing is kept under active review, with all possible steps taken to improve processing times.  This includes the assignment of additional resources, where available, and the review of business processes, to ensure the efficient processing of applications.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-23a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019102300077#WRC01800"><p>On Budget Day, I announced measures to support young jobseekers including the abolition of the age-related rate of payment for 25 year olds, from January 2020. I also announced that the increased rate would be available to jobseekers aged 18 to 24 who are living independently and in receipt of State housing supports including rent supplement and the Housing Assistance Payment.   </p>  <p>  From next January, a young jobseeker aged 25 years will receive a weekly increase of &euro;45.20 from &euro;157.80 up to &euro;203 and a younger jobseeker will benefit by up to &euro;90.30 per week. These are significant weekly increases.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 19,000 jobseekers aged 18-25 of which 16,100 are in receipt of a reduced age-related payment.  The measures that I have announced will benefit approximately 2,080 of those on the reduced rates at a cost of &euro;5.2 million for 2020, leaving a balance of approximately 14,000 on age related rates.  </p>  <p>  In 2009, youth unemployment had reached its highest rate with almost  28% of young people under the age of 25 unemployed. The CSO seasonally-adjusted youth unemployment rate for September 2019 has almost halved in the last 10 years to 14.8%.</p>  <p>  Age-related rates for young jobseekers protect them from long-term welfare dependency, by providing them with a strong financial incentive to participate in education or training to improve their chances of obtaining full time employment. A young jobseeker who participates in education or training receives the maximum personal rate of &euro;203. Jobseekers who participate in the Youth Employment Support Scheme, receive &euro;229.20. I will continue to focus on youth unemployment and in developing initiatives to help young people back into work.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department is finalising a review on the impacts of the reduced rates on young jobseekers and I expect that this will be completed shortly.  </p></reply>

We have called for these freedoms to be upheld, while encouraging all sides to refrain from violence and to engage in an inclusive dialogue. Ireland's Consul General and the EU Office in Hong Kong continue to engage with the Hong Kong authorities in relation to the ongoing developments there. </p>  <p>  The EU, with the support of Ireland, has also issued statements in response to developments in Hong Kong, the most recent of which was released on the 2 October by High Representative Mogherini on behalf of the EU. This statement reiterated the EU position that the right of assembly must be upheld, while peaceful demonstrations must be ensured. It recalled the EU&rsquo;s support for the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; principle, and welcomed recent steps toward dialogue by the Hong Kong authorities.</p>  <p>  During the most recent session of the Human Rights Council on 10 September, the EU also expressed support for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' call for the demonstrations to remain peaceful and for the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms, including the freedom of assembly.</p>  <p>  With regards to the situation in Xinjiang, Ireland and the EU have raised this issue consistently in a bilateral context with our Chinese counterparts.  Ireland and the EU regularly raise human rights concerns at multilateral level, in particular at the Human Rights Council. During the Human Rights Council session in June this year, Ireland was one of 22 states that signed a letter which called for China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Xinjiang Province, and to allow unrestricted access to independent observers. Ireland also participated in China&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review last November, where we expressed concern at reports of the treatment of ethnic Uighurs and urged China to respect freedom of religion and belief. </p>  <p>  In April this year, the EU raised human rights concerns with China at both the annual EU-China Summit and the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. During this dialogue the EU noted that while actions to counter terrorism are essential, such measures must respect the principle of proportionality, fundamental freedoms and international laws. The EU raised the system of political re-education camps and called on China to allow meaningful, unsupervised and unrestricted access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special Procedures. </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU will continue to raise these issues during both political and official contacts with the Chinese authorities in appropriate fora. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-23a.113.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019102300078#WRD02400"><p>I can assure the Deputy that insurance reform remains a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, has produced two reports, and is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report and the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report.  The most recent Update Report, the ninth, was published in July and shows that the vast majority of the CIWG recommendations have been implemented.  A key conclusion of the CIWG was that there was no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately address the problem of rapidly rising insurance premiums.  Instead, a broad series of initiatives are required to address this problem.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the Government has brought forward a number of pieces of legislation, arising from recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  These include the following:</p>  <p>  - The Judicial Council Act 2019, which was enacted in July.  This is a key piece of legislation in the context of insurance reform.  It provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum, following the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly;</p>  <p>  - The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018, which has established the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank.  This will increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will also make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;</p>  <p>  - The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019, which makes important reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, by strengthening its powers around compliance with its procedures; </p>  <p>  - The Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 to reform the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; and</p>  <p>  - Amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.  These were introduced through the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.</p>  <p>  I would also note that an important piece of work that may entail legislation in the future is the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s (LRC) work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.  This work is well underway and I am hopeful that it will conclude in the second half of 2020.  This could in turn have a positive impact on the cost of insurance. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question in respect of sanctions for false or exaggerated claims, I would note that the CIWG considered this issue during its consideration of employer and public liability insurance.  In particular, it reviewed the relevant sections of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 (sections 25 and 26).  The CIWG noted that the number of recorded prosecutions and convictions for the offence of false evidence in section 25 is very low and that this suggested a need for further co-operation between the insurance industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It also noted that while the majority of applications in respect of alleged fraudulent actions under section 26 were refused, it concluded that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the provision.  It also commented that there was a need for defendants to more regularly challenge misleading evidence, where appropriate by taking it to court, rather than settling on the court steps for fear of an unsatisfactory outcome.</p>  <p>  A number of other measures are being taken by way of ensuring that sections 25 and 26 can have their intended effect in relation to insurance fraud.  For example, the various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, are key to this.  The recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud also demonstrates the commitment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle false or exaggerated claims, and I commend the Garda&iacute; for their recent raids under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, in this regard.</p>  <p>  As I think the Deputy will appreciate from these developments, a concerted policy approach is being taken with the support of the Cost of Insurance Working Group to address the issue of insurance fraud including as it impacts on small and medium enterprises and the broader business community. This is being done by means of a series of mutually reinforcing measures.  At the same time, they are intended, in their collective implementation, to give greater effect to the existing provisions of sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.</p>  <p>  Finally, I believe all of the reforms mentioned above are already having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from September 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak) and the Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p></reply>

The Roadmap takes a holistic view of pension issues and details specific measures presented under six strands. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Roadmap is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and her Department, but the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) was allocated a number of specific measures under the Roadmap.  The IDPRTG is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform, the Department of Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection, Revenue and the Pensions Authority. </p>  <p>  The actions allocated to the IDPRTG under the Roadmap derive in the main from Strand 3, which is concerned with improving the governance and regulation of supplementary pensions to, among other things, achieve scale, improve standards and simplify the provision of pensions.  Relevant action points include the consideration of measures that could harmonise rules, eliminate anomalies and rationalise the number of pension vehicles.  </p>  <p>  The IDPRTG has been considering these action points as part of a process that included a public consultation. It has produced a report that I will be considering in the coming months.</p></reply>

Earlier in the year, I hosted a symposium on Small Schools which gave me an opportunity to restate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to small schools and to open a dialogue with all the key stakeholders. The purpose of this work by the Department is to develop a policy proposal to help support and strengthen small primary schools throughout the country.</p>  <p>Budget 2020 is the third successive budget to provide for an increase in the number of principal release days.   One additional release day will be allocated to each school with a teaching principal with effect from 1st   September 2020.  This will bring the number of release days to 19, 25 and 31, depending on the size of school.  This is an increase from 14, 18 and 22 days since 2015.  In addition, a further four additional release days are allocated to schools with special classes.</p>  <p>  There are arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increase of release days, the Government lifted the moratorium on middle management posts in 2017.  In total almost 1300 leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since 2017 which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  My Department has committed to revising the number of available Posts of Responsibility to take account of retirements during the school year.  This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibilities are maintained in the school system.</p></reply>

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, importantly, in consultation with parents and having regard to the ethos of the school. Curricular provision for Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) and RSE across primary and post-primary level is aimed at ensuring that topics are covered in an age appropriate manner. </p><p>In April 2018, a review of RSE in schools was announced by my predecessor, Mr. Richard Bruton TD.  The Minister asked the NCCA to undertake a review, not just of the content of the curriculum but of how it is taught in schools. The NCCA advises the Department and Minister in relation to the curriculum to be taught in our schools.</p><p>The NCCA were asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum, in particular the importance of consent and what it means. The NCCA also looked at developments in relation to contraception and at healthy, positive, sexual expression and relationships, safe use of the Internet, social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem, and LGBTQ+ matters. </p><p>The NCCA has conducted a thorough and transparent review, and has published a draft report of its findings in July 2019.</p><p>The draft Report has been developed on foot of extensive consultation which was conducted between June 2018 and March 2019. There was widespread participation in this phase of the consultation which included: </p><p>-  7,891 parental responses; including 3,300 National Parents Council Primary and 553 National Parents Council post-primary responses (the remainder of responses were directly sent to the NCCA)</p><p>-  Engagement with 512 young people, 1333 teachers, via online responses</p><p>-  Focus groups with over 600 children and young people, teachers, parents and school leaders within school settings</p><p>-  Participation from 51 organisations at a Symposium on RSE in November 2018</p><p>-  Meetings with 63 organisations and individuals</p><p>-  65 written submissions </p><p>-  Consultation event with 77 young people from Comhairl&iacute; na n&Oacute;g. </p><p>When finalised, the report will be provided to my Department, which is expected to be around the end of this year. </p><p>The draft report is currently open to a public consultation which will not close until 25th October, and anyone is free to contribute to this process and may do so through the NCCA&rsquo;s website or directly to RSEreview@ncca.ie</p><p>A report onRelationships and Sexuality Education  was published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills  in January 2019. This wide ranging report refers to a number of submissions from various stakeholders. It is important to note, however,  that it the NCCA is the body which has statutory responsibility to advise the Minister on the contents of curriculum. The NCCA has considered the Oireachtas Joint Committee report as part of its review. </p><p>It is important to point out that no decisions have yet been made regarding changes to the RSE curriculum. Any misinformation that is currently circulating as to what will be in the RSE curriculum is regrettable. </p><p>Whatever is decided as a result of the review, the need to teach RSE in an age-appropriate manner with sensitivity to the diversity of needs and readiness of students will continue to be of paramount importance. </p><p>The entire focus of RSE is on preparing young people for adult life, on emphasising the importance of respect for themselves and each other, understanding the importance of consent and helping young people to develop and mature in a positive light. </p><p>I await the outcome of the NCCA review before deciding on what steps should be taken to improve the student experience of the RSE curriculum.</p><p>I hope that this helps to allay any concerns you may have had in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post-primary level to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects (STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish and Home Economics, in particular).  </p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I refer to the current entry requirements to programmes of primary initial teacher education (ITE); the process and requirements for accreditation of programmes, across both the undergraduate and postgraduate entry routes to primary teaching and the actions being taken in relation to supply of teachers at primary under the Teacher Supply Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Entry Requirements for ITE</p>  <p>  Minimum Entry Requirements for primary ITE are set by the Minister for Education and Skills. The Minimum Entry Requirements (MERs) for English, Mathematics and Gaeilge were announced in October 2017 and require achieving Leaving Certificate grades of O4/H7, O4/H7 and H4 respectively and apply for all students wishing to undertake a Primary ITE programme.  These higher grades apply from September 2019 for those entering the Bachelor of Education and from September 2021 for those wishing to enter the Primary Professional Master of Education.  </p>  <p>  Accreditation of programmes</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has a central role in setting the standards for ITE, through accreditation of the programmes and setting the standards for teachers to gain entry to the Register of Teachers. All primary ITE programmes must be accredited in accordance with the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (2011, updated in 2017). The Criteria and Guidelines provide for both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes of initial teacher education, as a means to be registered as a primary teacher:</p>  <p>  -  Undergraduate programmes (often referred to as concurrent programmes or the Bachelor of Education) must be of at least four years&rsquo; duration. These programmes are awarded at level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). Most entrants come via the CAO; however some entrants may be mature students, including those who may already have a Level 8 qualification. </p>  <p>  -  Post-graduate programmes (often referred to as consecutive programmes, or the Professional Master of Education) must be at least two years&rsquo; duration. These programmes are awarded at Level 9 on the NFQ. All entrants to the post-graduate programme must have an honours degree, before being accepted onto the programme.</p>  <p>  These entry routes continue to allow for a diversity of ways to enter into the teaching profession. </p>  <p>  Teacher Supply</p>  <p>  The Steering Group on Teacher Supply, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department, is overseeing the implementation of the Teacher Supply Action Plan, which I launched in November 2018.</p>  <p>  A number of actions following from the plan support the supply of substitute teachers in primary schools, including: </p>  <p>  -  The creation of new substitute teacher supply panels on a pilot basis in 6 locations that have been identified as having the greatest challenge in terms of sourcing substitute teachers (two panels in Dublin and one each in Kildare, Meath, Cork and Galway); </p>  <p>  -  The development of an online substitute teacher recruitment portal, to match available teachers with short term substitute teacher vacancies in schools.</p></reply>

They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and school staff from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.</p><p>Through applications to NCSE&rsquo;s Supports Service, schools and individual teachers can access support in all areas of special education, including support in relation to students who are deaf and/or blind. Current training available to teaching staff in the area of deaf/hard of hearing and blind/visually impaired include:</p><p>-  School Based Seminars including NCSE designed and delivered Seminars</p><p>-  On-line and elearning</p><p>- College and university post graduate courses in Deaf/Hard of Hearing and Blind/Visual Impairment  <b></b></p><p>The Support Service also provides funding for individual teachers and whole school staff in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special  classes and special schools  to undertake courses in Irish Sign Language, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.</p><p>On 24 January 2019, I launched a new undergraduate programme in DCU that enables deaf and hard of hearing people who use Irish Sign Language (ISL) to enter primary teaching.</p></reply>

Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  In line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, it is for the Commissioner to decide and balance the organisation's needs within the resources allocated to him.  For example, in addition to recruiting 600 Garda&iacute; the Commissioner decided this year to recruit an additional 600 Garda staff in 2019.  This will in turn allow for the redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to front-line policing duties by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  In addition, as recommended in the Commission's report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently conducting a strategic review of the Garda Reserve to inform future decisions around its use. The strategy is expected to inform the development and preparation for a new Reserve recruitment drive by the end of 2019.  I understand that a class of 100 reserves commenced training in March and, as of 31 August, there are 473 reserves across the organisation.  </p>  <p>  Finally, it may be noted that unprecedented resources are currently being provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  &euro;1.76 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019, as well as capital investment amounting to &euro; 92 million this year. I am pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s budget for 2020 to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year in addition to &euro;116million in capital investment.  This level of funding will allow the Garda Commissioner to recruit up to 700 new Garda&iacute; next year and additional Garda staff. </p>  <p>  This ongoing investment is intended to support growth in the organisation as well as the ambitious Garda reform plan, with the overall goal of ensuring a visible, professional and effective policing service to all our communities, urban and rural, now and into the future.</p></reply>

Should further documentation be required it will be requested from the applicant in due course.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. While most straightforward cases are now processed within six months, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the Immigration Service is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited. </p></reply>

Evidence of the clinical effectiveness of this new drug therapy was also reviewed.</p>  <p>  After a thorough review of all the data it was decided to approve access for children with genetically confirmed SMA Type I, II or III, in accordance with the controlled access criteria recommended by the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee. The actual patient assessment and approval process is the means for determining access, on an individual case-by-case basis, to this complex treatment.</p>  <p>  The HSE has indicated that since July, 11 children have been approved for Spinraza treatment in Temple Street Hospital.  Application for approval is based on clearly defined criteria and clinical guidelines being followed in each case.  All patients who have been recommended clinically have been approved to date.</p>  <p>  All of the patients which have been approved for Spinraza treatment are being treated under special care under Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Temple Street Hospital.  Detailed clinical guidelines have been developed  for this service which include specific patient criteria which must be fulfilled  in order for the treatment to safely commence and continue.  </p>  <p>  The actual delivery of this drug to approved patients in a safe and sustainable way requires very specific and quite complex service arrangements to be put in place in Temple Street Hospital. </p>  <p>  Spinraza is injected during a procedure known as lumbar puncture. There are two categories of patients with regard to the administration of Spinraza.  For category 1, where the administration of Spinraza is deemed not too technically difficult, the Consultant Paediatric Neurologist and Lead Clinician need access to the day ward as administration is performed under local anaesthetic.  Each of these patient will also require a physiotherapy assessment pre- administration and recovery time in the Day Ward. </p>  <p>  Category 2 are the more complex patients who have already undergone spinal fusion surgery and insertion of spinal rods, which makes the administering of Spinraza potentially more complex.  For these patients, the delivery of Spinraza will require specialist care to include input by an Anaesthetist and an Interventional Radiologist with associated nursing and the availability of capacity in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate therefore that a considerable amount of service planning and assessment of patients at an individual level is required in order for treatment with Spinraza to be safely undertaken. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the HSE  that Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland  is currently engaging on an individual basis with the families  involved regarding each child&rsquo;s treatment plan.  I have asked the HSE to keep me updated on this matter.</p></reply>

However, many public units are housed in buildings that are less  than ideal in the modern context. The Government&rsquo;s Building on Recovery:  Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016 to 2021 programme provided the framework to allow for an enhanced  programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these long term care  facilities. </p>  <p>  The programme provides for a phased approach, with new builds  and larger projects sequenced towards the end of the six-year period. Most of  the funding comes from the Exchequer Capital Plan, with &euro;150m to be sourced  through Public Private Partnership.</p>  <p>  Since 2009 the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA)  has statutory responsibility for the independent registration and inspection of  all designated centres for older people, private &amp;amp; public.</p>  <p>  To  achieve registration, all designated centres must be fully compliant with  Regulations made under the Health Act 2007 and in line with National Standards.   The first National Standards were approved in February 2009.  At the time a  distinction was made between new builds (which had to comply from the outset),  and existing nursing homes (that were given 6 years, i.e., to 2015, to meet  certain infrastructural requirements, including in relation to single rooms,  floor space per resident, communal facilities, etc. However, this period  coincided with the country&rsquo;s economic crisis and the funds were not available to  deliver compliance by 2015.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan, Building on  Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, committed to a major  multi-annual programme of capital investment in public and voluntary social care  facilities. </p>  <p>  As a result, revised policy and legislation was brought forward  in 2016 to secure the continuation of public bed availability to the end of  2021. </p>  <p>  The ongoing engagements  between the Department of Health and the HSE have identified that by the end of 2021 over 80% of the  projects will be complete or under  construction. While this represents substantial progress on the Programme,  it is recognised that not all centres are  likely to be completed within the originally planned timeframe. At the request of my Department, the HSE is undertaking an integrated package of work to examine each of the CNU  projects as to their current status, next  stages of development, timelines and additional costs, and any measures that could be adopted to mitigate  challenges arising. Once this work is complete the HSE is expected to submit an  overarching report on the status of the programme to my Department.  The content  of this will be considered, along with further engagement with the HSE as  necessary and my officials will consider the appropriate next steps. While the  regulatory changes are over 2 years away,  the Department and the HSE are in early engagement which allows for the issues to be worked  through to determine the best course of  action.</p></reply>

The report contains 165 recommendations and proposes a move away from the often paternalistic interpretation of the existing legislation as well as including provisions which are intended to strengthen the protections for people who are detained without consent in approved centres. The broad thrust of the changes recommended by the Expert Group has been accepted and the previous Government gave approval for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill to amend the existing legislation to reflect the recommendations of the Expert Group. </p>  <p>  Progress on the comprehensive updating of the 2001 Act has been delayed in part because of the need to deal with a number of Private Members Bills over the past three years, as well a requirement for emergency legislation to cure a finding of unconstitutionality of section 15(3) of the 2001 Act.   </p>  <p>  A draft of heads of a bill based on the recommendations of the Expert Group Review of the 2001 Act was sent to the Mental Health Commission for their consideration on 2 July 2019.  It is essential that the Mental Health Commission, which has a very significant and important role in overseeing the safeguards provided in the Act, has full input into the framing of the many amendments to be included in revised mental health legislation. </p>  <p>  This is a phase in a process with the Commission likely to require a period in the region of six months to study and comment on the draft heads. Upon receipt of the Commission's comments, the Department will work with the Commission and other stakeholders on revising the draft where necessary, and then ready the legislation for publication.</p></reply>

The new office delivers a standardisation of approach to validation across all waiting lists in line with the best patient-centred practices. The validation of waiting lists better informs the true demand for hospital services and enables improved efficiency and patient scheduling.</p>  <p>  The NCVU commenced issuing waiting list validation correspondence on the 2nd November 2018. The core aim of the Validation Unit is to write to all patients waiting more than 6 months for hospital operations and procedures and all patients waiting more than 6 months for an outpatient appointment.</p>  <p>  The NCVU advise that as of 27th September 2019, they had completed 124 validation cycles, across 35 hospitals, resulting in 193,092 patients being contacted and 33,720 patients being removed from the Inpatient/Day Case and Outpatient waiting lists.</p>  <p>  A report on patients' reasons for requesting a removal from the Inpatient Waiting lists during administrative validation is being finalised by the Department of Health Research Unit and will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website in November.</p></reply>

These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2019 included a provision of &euro;10m for new drugs enabled by an &ldquo;invest to save&rdquo; programme. To assist the HSE in creating this financial headroom, the National Service Plan 2019 included a provision of &euro;3m for the establishment of an HSE dedicated pharmaceutical value improvement programme, to bring about greater efficiencies in medicines management and to promote changes in prescribing behaviour in favour of more clinically efficient and cost-effective products in both community and hospital settings.</p>  <p>  These new measures are expected to complement existing cost control initiatives which are being undertaken by the HSE under the auspices of the Medicines Management Programme. Among the initiatives already being pursued are improvement in practices for the procurement of drugs in hospitals and the designation of preferred products, with a focus on high cost prescribing areas.</p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative (IHSI) which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.  </p>  <p>  These domestic and international measures are being taken to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 29 new medicines and 5 new uses of existing medicines representing a significant investment by the HSE to provide access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients.  It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next five years. </p>  <p>  With regards to 2020, funding is provided to the HSE for health services in accordance with the letter of determination which sets out the approved level of overall HSE expenditure for the year. The letter of determination issued from my Department on 11 October 2019.  The NSP which must, under legislation, set out the type and volume of health and personal social services, to be provided during the year in question within the funding allocated. </p>  <p>  The HSE is at present working on the development of the National Service Plan 2020 in line with the provisions of its governing legislation.</p></reply>

The exact impact that these tariffs will have on agrifood trade is impossible to determine, and this includes how trade flows might change in response. However, it is clear that the imposition of these tariffs, and any other regulatory burden imposed on goods entering the UK, would particularly negatively affect Irish farmers and Irish food exports to the UK.</p>  <p>  My Department has taken steps to mitigate the impact of Brexit over a number of budgets including through the provision of low cost loans, the &euro;300m Brexit Fund and the &euro;300m future growth loan scheme.  We have also supported market diversification efforts in order to reduce our exposure to the UK market. In addition, the threat of a no deal Brexit is being addressed through Budget 2020 by making &euro;110 million available as a first tranche to help farmers, fishermen and food SME&rsquo;s to navigate the challenges that a no deal Brexit would present. These measures include immediate support for our beef sector (&euro;85m), support for our fishing fleet (&euro;14m), &euro;5m towards marketing in non-UK markets and necessary support to other sectors to improve competitiveness (&euro;6m).</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Commission announced a &euro;50 million package for Irish beef producers - the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) is a demand-led measure, with both eligibility criteria and conditionality, i.e. farmers who meet the initial eligibility criteria then commit to meeting certain conditions to qualify for aid.  By the closing date for the scheme, over 34,500 farmers had applied for inclusion in the scheme with a total potential drawdown of &euro;78m.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I and my officials are continuing with our Brexit preparedness work, within a whole of Government effort, to ensure the best possible outcome for the agrifood sector and that the appropriate financial supports are being put in place to support the sector.</p></reply>

This programme allows Member States and financial institutions operating across the EU to engage with the Commission and the EIB to develop schemes tailored to their own individual needs and requirements. </p>  <p>  Ireland, through my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in partnership with the Department of Finance and the SBCI, has already engaged with the EIB &amp;amp; the European Investment Fund (EIF) to develop the Future Growth Loan Scheme.  It is being delivered through participating finance providers nationally and will make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agrifood &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p>  <p>  The loans are competitively priced (an initial maximum loan interest rate of 4.5% for loans less than &euro;250,000), will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment. A minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 applies up to a maximum of &euro;3,000,000 per applicant. However, considering the needs of Irish farmers, I have negotiated a specific minimum of &euro;50,000 for them.</p>  <p>  This is a financial product that was previously unavailable in Ireland, hence the involvement of the various public bodies to bring it to market. The unique characteristic of the Scheme is that loans up to &euro;500,000 are unsecured making it a viable source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p>  <p>  Food companies have identified long-term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland.  I am happy that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain from primary producer to processor.</p>  <p>  The Scheme which launched earlier this year has been open for loan eligibility applications through the SBCI website since 17th April and there has been a good level of demand from farmers.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities is to improve access to finance for the agrifood sector. I look forward to continuing to work nationally, with the Commission, with the EIB/EIF and others to ensure that Irish farmers have access to appropriate financial products to enable them to sustain and develop their individual enterprises.</p></reply>

These actions include developing the infrastructure to stay sufficiently ahead of demand.    There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 95 fast chargers (the majority of which are operated by the ESB) in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I am in the process of increasing the level of investment in charging infrastructure. Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, funding of up to &euro;10 million will support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network, with ESB eCars also investing &euro;10m. This project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers consisting of 90 150kW chargers (each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously) and upgrading 50 existing standard chargers (each consisting of 2 charge points) to 50kW chargers The project will also involve replacing over 500 existing standard charge points with next generation high reliability models. </p>  <p>  This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. The locations of the chargers that will be installed as part of this project have not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by ESB eCars and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  I expect approximately half of the 140 new fast chargers to be installed by the end of 2020 bringing the total to over 160 fast chargers. This is expected to further increase to over 200 by the end of 2021 and over 230 by the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  In August, I announced funding to support the rollout by Local Authorities of up to 1,000 on-street public charge points for electric vehicles over the next 5 years. This is to cater mainly for electric vehicle owners who rely on on-street parking as their primary means of parking near their homes. Under the scheme, which opened for applications last month, Local Authorities can apply to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for funding. Budget 2020 provided funding of &euro;2 million for the scheme that will allow up to 400 charge points to be supported next year. The rollout of on-street charge points over the coming years under this scheme is dependent on the uptake of this support by Local Authorities. </p>  <p>Under the Climate Action Plan, the government will develop an overarching charging infrastructure strategy with a target to be set for the supply of infrastructure to stay ahead of demand. In that strategy, we will review and update the targets (currently set out in the National Policy Framework for Alternative fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland 2017-2030) for the supply of public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, taking into account the proposed uptake of electric vehicles set out in this plan.</p></reply>

They are intended, in particular, to facilitate the achievement of the targets for the recovery of packaging waste established by the Directive. Ireland surpassed the material specific target of 15% for wood packaging, which encompasses wooden pallets, with a 74% recycling rate in 2017.    Under the Regulations producers, including manufacturers, importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers are obliged to segregate the packaging waste arising on their own premises into specified waste streams including wood, and have it collected by authorised recovery operators for recycling. A pilot targeted packaging enforcement project has been in operation since 2017 with the aim of promoting compliance with the Regulations, spreading awareness of the policy and legislation and developing best practice in areas of common interest without prejudice to the statutory responsibilities and obligations of the local authority or the compliance scheme. Each local authority is responsible for the enforcement of the Packaging Regulations in their functional areas and I am satisfied the necessary powers are available to them for that purpose.</p></reply>

The installation of smart meters is a key enabler for the energy transition to a decarbonised system as outlined in the Government's Climate Action Plan.    This is a very significant energy infrastructure project. The rollout will occur in a structured and phased basis, commencing with an initial delivery of 20,000 meters by year end, rising to 250,000 meters by end 2020 and a further 500,000 meters every year from 2021 to 2024.</p>  <p>  On 2 September 2019 ESB Networks commenced the rollout in Portlaoise and Bandon and their surrounding areas.

This extra investment has supported a doubling of capacity in the sector, including both ECCE and the 0-3 age group.</p>  <p>  Each year my Department reviews the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare sector to determine how the Capital funding available can best be invested. </p>  <p>  The decision on where to target capital spending to support policy aims is informed by an analysis of the current state of the childcare sector, learnings from previous capital programmes and feedback and input from stakeholders, including childcare providers and data from Pobal and other sources. </p>  <p>  In previous years the Department has invested greatly in both privately run or operated by community or not for profit preschool providers in creating and maintaining Early Childhood Care and Education places within their services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in recent years, capital funding has been made available for the maintenance and improvement of community early learning and care services. This funding is made available in order to protect previous state investment where it exists, as many community services were set up through significant capital investment under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP 2000-2006) and/or the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP 2006-2010), and to assist not-for-profit services which may lack the financial capacity to invest significant portions of their own funds into maintenance or improvement works. </p>  <p>  In order to maximise the number of service providers and families who benefit from Early Years and School Age capital funding, limits on the individual grant sizes awarded are necessary. Focus on smaller individual grant sizes, as in previous single-year capital programmes, means that projects could ultimately be funded with the available budget. This also enabled us to build capacity gradually across a wider geographical spread, responding to the increased demand that exists all around the country due to the new initiatives I have introduced to support access to affordable and high quality childcare.</p>  <p>  Planning for 2020's Capital offering is currently underway within my Department. The details of this will be communicated to providers in due course.</p>  <p>  Childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan (2018-2027) and &euro;250m in capital funding was secured for childcare under the plan. </p>  <p>  The NDP funding will allow us return to funding larger scale, multi year projects. Research is on-going to determine areas of specific need that the NDP funding will address when it comes on stream in the coming years. The exact shape and priorities of this funding is currently being developed: more information will be made public on childcare plans under the NDP as it becomes available.</p></reply>

This followed the publication of Ireland's first National Social Enterprise Policy in July.</p>  <p>  While I acknowledge that the delivery of some of the actions outlined in these important policy initiatives will take time, I am fully committed to achieving the objectives set out in both.</p>  <p>  The Strategy sets out a long-term vision for our communities in Ireland and will entail far-reaching changes across Government and the community and voluntary sector. The Strategy was co-produced by Government and the Community and Voluntary Sector through a Cross Sectoral Group (CSG) established for that purpose. The implementation of actions in the Strategy is subject to an annual work planning process and my Department is currently reviewing the membership of the Cross Sectoral Group (CSG) to ensure appropriate stakeholder participation during Strategy implementation. The group will advise and support the annual work planning process and I envisage the first meeting of this CSG will take place in December next.</p>  <p>  The National Social Enterprise Policy will help to create an enabling environment for social enterprise to grow and contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic progress. </p>  <p>  My Department has an allocation of &euro;291 million in 2019, of which &euro;148 million is allocated to the community development programme. Budget 2020 provided for an increase in my Department's budget of &euro;17 million which I intend to use for targeted measures across the rural and community development areas.</p>  <p>  The breakdown of the &euro;308 million Budget 2020 allocation for DRCD will fall to be considered in the context of the Revised Estimates 2020 to be published in December by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. However, the funding will allow me to continue the existing level of strong support for community development programmes. Furthermore, I expect to be able to increase supports for the community development area as follows:</p>  <p>-   an increase in funding to the PEACE programme of &euro;2million, to &euro;7million. This programme is particularly important given current uncertainty surrounding Brexit. It is designed to promote positive relations and social cohesion in the cross border region. The total value of the programme is approximately &euro;270 million (85% funded by the EU).</p>  <p>  - a &euro;3 million package of targeted supports for the community and voluntary sector, and organisations and individuals in disadvantaged communities</p>  <p>  - an additional &euro;1.5 million across the SICAP and CSP (&euro;43.2 million and &euro;46.2 million respectively in 2019) to fund some new organisations and to provide targeted supports for disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  - &euro;1.2 million to support the implementation of measures in the Strategy for Community and Voluntary Sector development in Ireland, which will include enhanced supports for the structures which drive local engagement in decision making - the Public Participation Networks and Local Community Development Committees.</p>  <p>  In respect of social enterprise, my Department provides ongoing support of &euro;2 million per annum through the Social Enterprise measure of the Dormant Accounts Fund, and through the Social Enterprise Development Fund administered by Social Innovation Fund Ireland (SIFI).  The latter is a &euro;1.6 million fund to be delivered over the three-year period 2018-2020.  My Department has contributed &euro;800,000 towards the Fund, on a match-funding basis with SIFI. My Department also supports social enterprises through a number of other programmes including the Community Services Programme (CSP), SICAP, and LEADER.  </p>  <p>  In additional to these supports, I intend to provide an additional allocation of &euro;300,000 in 2020 for the development and implementation of the National Social Enterprise Policy and the forthcoming Rural Development policy which will succeed the Action Plan for Rural Development at the end of this year. The funding will be additional to the Dormant Accounts Fund and will support initiatives such as raising awareness of social enterprises and developing a methodology to measure the economic and social impact of social enterprises in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Overall, the allocation made available to me in Budget 2020 will ensure continued delivery of the strong existing suite of community development measures; and allow additional targeted resources to support further delivery of actions within both the strategy and social enterprise policy.</p></reply>

The annual allocation is therefore &euro;38 million per annum for the period of the programme. For the 2016 and 2017 period, the average annual allocation was just under &euro;38m.</p>  <p>  The Scheme to Support National Organisations provides multiannual core funding to national organisations in the Community and Voluntary sector. Allocations are made to organisations over a three year period. &euro;18.8m has been allocated to the current scheme which commenced July this year and will run to July 2022. The average annual allocation will therefore be &euro;6.3 million. The previous iteration ran from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019 with an allocation of &euro;16.7 million.</p>  <p>  The Community Enhancement Programme (CEP)  supports small scale capital projects that enhance community facilities for individuals and communities that are impacted by disadvantage. It was launched in 2018  with an initial allocation of &euro;4.5 million. This was subsequently increased to &euro;13 million, with &euro;0.5 million of this ring-fenced for Men&rsquo;s Sheds funding.  This year, &euro;4.5 million was again allocated to the programme, with further funding of &euro;0.5 million Men&rsquo;s and Women&rsquo;s Sheds made available through Dormant Accounts Funding. </p>  <p>  The overall level of funding for the Department will increase from &euro;291 million in 2019 to &euro;308 million in 2020. This will facilitate the continued delivery of key programmes for rural Ireland and communities across the country; and provide an additional &euro;17 million to support priority areas. </p>  <p>  Exact allocations in respect of 2020 will fall to be considered under the Revised Estimates 2020 to be published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in December. It is my intention, however, to increase the LEADER allocation from &euro;30 million in 2019 to &euro;40 million in 2020 to reflect increased drawdown under this programme. I also envisage that an additional &euro;1.5 million will be provided across SICAP and the Community Services Programme to provide targeted supports for disadvantaged communities.</p></reply>

I recently approved a comprehensive review of the LCDCs which was underpinned by extensive consultation and highlighted significant progress since LCDCs were established.  The review also recognised a number of challenges to be addressed to secure the longer-term effectiveness of the structures. It makes a series of recommendations including securing greater cross-government buy-in; improved development and support programmes for LCDCs and members; and strengthening and streamlining administrative supports. </p>  <p>  I believe the deputy is referring to the issue of participation and engagement which was one of the themes used to guide the review process. The review did conclude that despite achieving good levels of participation and engagement some challenges remain. Consideration was given to the size of LCDCs when they were being developed, with a focus on achieving the optimum balance between a tight and effective committee on one hand and securing sufficient participation on the other. This remains the objective and LCDCs are using mechanisms such as sub-committees and working groups to broaden participation and engagement. However as participation and engagement appears to remain a challenge, particularly from the perspective of non-state actors, the review did conclude that perhaps these mechanisms are not as effectively or as widely used as they should be. </p>  <p>  The review commits to the development of a training and development programme to support the work of the LCDCs. Such a programme will address issues including Governance and the use of sub-groups and committees and the need for the LCDC to secure meaningful and sustainable engagement with communities. In addition, the new five year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities also contains actions to strengthen the Public Participation Networks (PPNs), the primary mechanism for communities to engage with local government decision making structures including the LCDC.  Specifically action 7.3 commits to the provision of resources to support members of the PPN to engage with local authority decision-making structures and processes.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s mission is to promote active participation and inclusion in society through the framework of employment rights and the provision of income supports, employment services and other services.</p>  <p>  The Department's objective is to continue putting our customers at the centre of all our operations, providing an efficient and effective service and continue developing our staff, structures and processes. </p>  <p>  The Department has engaged with the IHREC on a number of fronts in recent times. During 2018, the IHREC Chief Commissioner, Ms Emily Logan presented at the Department&rsquo;s Senior Management Conference. In addition IHREC presented at the Social Inclusion Forum which the Department hosted in the Aviva Stadium and the Department's Assistant Principal forum in Dublin Castle, attended by over 200 senior managers. A departmental working group was established in 2018 which assessed DEASP's actions in the area of public sector duty.</p>  <p>  This Department has also promoted the Professional Diploma in Human Rights and Equality offered by IHREC in conjunction with the IPA and a number of staff have undertaken this course. In addition, representatives from the Department's policy areas are due to undertake Public Sector Duty training with IHREC in November, 2019.</p>  <p>  The Department provides ongoing supports and learning programmes to create awareness in relation equality for the benefit of staff and customers. </p>  <p>  All new staff undertake a two-day Induction and Orientation course, one day of which is focused on best customer service practice and addresses issues of equality and diversity, discrimination and unconscious bias to underpin the significance of these matters. </p>  <p>The Department's Staff Development Unit promotes to staff the e-learning module, Delivering Equality in Public Services: An Introduction for Frontline Staff hosted on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  This e-learning course provides an introduction to equality in service delivery.  It is designed for frontline workers in the public sector to help them make equality real in their day-to-day work in the context of equality law. A dedicated intranet site also provides access to e-learning modules from the National Disability Authority-   Disability Equality Training for Public Sector Staff. </p>  <p>  The Department has recently developed a suite of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) accredited learning programmes in collaboration with the National College of Ireland (NCI) directly addressing topics such as decision making and bias as well as ethics, equality and diversity. The current Certificate in Social Protection Studies explicitly references the Public Sector Duty and is available to all staff in my Department.</p></reply>
